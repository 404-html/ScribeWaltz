1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,433
Yeah,

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,243
I write every day.
I get up around five or so and get two 

3
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:15,594
little kids off to school and then I go 
to work around nine and work until four 

4
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:24,180
o'clock or so and then do it pretty much
every day.

5
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,361
Oh,
I wish.

6
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,350
No,
it doesn't get easier.

7
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:31,630
It gets harder in fact,
because I,

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,930
you can't write the same book and that 
would,

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,960
that's always tempting to making a 
sentences is hard work.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,480
You can't copy your own sentences and 
you can't copy those of others.

11
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:47,314
And so you're searching,
you're searching for a certain grace in 

12
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:51,244
a certain rhythm and melody that's 
underneath the pros that carries the 

13
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:56,974
story.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,730
Great question.
The first answer that pops in my head is

15
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:03,564
absolutism certainty.
I'm certain about very little in this 

16
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:11,110
world and I just trust those who are,
they have a,

17
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,250
I feel a stinker.
The smell of,

18
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,490
of a blinders and of,
of uh,

19
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,960
compacity and pretentiousness that for 
me,

20
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:23,600
a companies,
uh,

21
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,483
certainty or a little bit of hype.
Hypocrisy also weaves its way through 

22
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:29,754
absolutism.
And there's so much of it around us on 

23
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:34,500
television.
Every talk show seems to have it.

24
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:35,334
And in the real world,
I'm always encountering people who 

25
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,070
declare things about the world I live in
with the certainty that I just don't,

26
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:48,080
don't see around me.
And in my writing that shows.

27
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,090
That's why the issue of truth appears so
much throughout all of my books that I'm

28
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,730
skeptical of.
Well,

29
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:57,390
what's declared to be true?

30
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,710
I don't think pride is the right word.
I look,

31
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,573
I look at the book now 20 years after 
having written it with a sense of 

32
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:07,324
dissociation.
I find it hard to believe that those 

33
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:13,300
stories are mine and those sentences are
mine.

34
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,090
And in a way they aren't any longer.
They're part of a world of literature.

35
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:24,091
A book goes out and it takes on its own.
I want to say it someone life,

36
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,144
but it's the own,
the about illness and identity that is 

37
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:31,090
divorced from the person who,
who made it.

38
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,620
And I feel sometimes even now,
but like a fraud that I know I wrote the

39
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:38,800
book and intellectually I know it,
but,

40
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,680
um,
it to read,

41
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:42,514
it surprises me at times,
phrasal surprise me or an event will 

42
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:51,061
surprise me and come at me a bit,
little bit as a stranger's voice does.

43
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,850
And in a way,
I am a stranger.

44
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:58,780
The person who wrote that book,
I'm 20 years older and I've had 20 years

45
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,780
of,
of new experiences,

46
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,810
children and things I never had before 
that make that old voice seem old.

47
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,270
No,
no way.

48
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,104
It's life is eerily,
and uncannily echoed that final chapter 

49
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:19,234
of the block where the timmy,
that little kid at the end of that book 

50
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,840
was a forerunner to the author who wrote
the book.

51
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:28,060
It's an effort,
uh,

52
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,900
as the story says at the end of say,
little timmy is life.

53
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,200
I A little boy who grew up in a small 
cow town in southern Minnesota and found

54
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:38,644
himself in a entangled and in Vietnam,
but not just in Vietnam and in hard 

55
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:49,051
moral choices that it never had occurred
to me I'd ever faced in my life.

56
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,093
And the little naive lone ranger playing
timmy that became that soldier in 

57
00:03:57,641 --> 00:04:02,641
Vietnam was a kind of stranger to the 
guy who wrote that book,

58
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:04,114
the the middle aged me.
And just as now the author of the book 

59
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:11,830
seems a bit of a stranger.
Um,

60
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,360
by bid off,
I mean,

61
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:16,030
I,
I'm not talking mysticism.

62
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:17,540
I'm simply saying that,
you know,

63
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,250
20 years is a long time to pass and,
and uh,

64
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,543
well when a sense of self changes,
I think of myself now primarily as a 

65
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,864
father and secondarily as a writer and 
I've heard those words come out of my 

66
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:34,474
mouth.
20 years ago it would have been 

67
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:36,340
impossible.
It didn't want,

68
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:38,740
kids didn't think it would be very much 
fun,

69
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,810
didn't think it would challenge me.
I thought it'd be kind of bored by it.

70
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,930
And now that is more of my life then,
then a writing.

71
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,150
It's nothing intelligent behind it.
That is,

72
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:57,160
it wasn't a rationally planned 
operation,

73
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:58,930
but rather it's how the world comes at 
me.

74
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,513
He comes at me and a mix of my 
imagination coming over here to do this 

75
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:05,854
interview.
I'm imagining will I meet and what will 

76
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:08,664
it be like?
And I've never done a video interview 

77
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:11,284
before.
And what will the physicality of the 

78
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:17,140
place be and all these and partly the 
real world.

79
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,830
And I think that I'm not all that 
uncommon in that.

80
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:24,100
I think we all live partly in our 
daydreams.

81
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:24,934
And daydreams is the wrong word because 
it makes it sound syrupy and mystically 

82
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:33,340
I'd met,
but I partly mean daydreams and I partly

83
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:37,120
mean just thought or anticipation of 
event that hasn't yet occurred.

84
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,500
And I think we all live there and you 
certainly live there in a situation such

85
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:44,320
as a war where you're partly,
uh,

86
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,560
the reality of the world is in your 
face.

87
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,113
But partly there's the wistful call of 
girlfriends and home and all the things 

88
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,510
you don't have yearned for,
where you're living,

89
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:59,150
partly your imagination.
I'm not in a war.

90
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,180
And you'll flow in and out of these two 
the way you would maybe in a cancer ward

91
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:10,090
or if your marriage is collapsing or 
your father has died or you're partly,

92
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:10,924
he had the stark reality,
that corpse in that coffin and you have 

93
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:14,594
partly remembering your dad's face as he
threw you a baseball or were even more 

94
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:23,390
poignantly to,
in my case,

95
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:26,000
the wished that he were saying,
I'm throwing you a baseball.

96
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:29,240
Kind of the invented throwing of a what 
wasn't.

97
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,640
So I guess what I'm saying is that I 
didn't like,

98
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,790
like everything.
I don't,

99
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,590
I didn't,
I don't,

100
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,760
didn't plan in a cerebral way.
The form of the things they carried,

101
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,800
it took advantage of what was natural to
me.

102
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,690
I mean intentionally knew what I was 
doing,

103
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,510
but I was taking advantage of what 
really is pretty natural to me.

104
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:55,511
I live in at least those two worlds of 
imagination and a world we all live in.

105
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,493
Well through story.
Essentially what you hope is that when 

106
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:08,981
you do what I do and you write novels,
you're hoping for for a sense of feeling

107
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:12,434
to come through in the end,
that through nonfiction the brain is 

108
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:20,540
engaged and the head is engaged 
primarily not always just that,

109
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:25,541
but primarily and with fiction telling 
invented stories.

110
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,713
The hope is that through the story or 
read her lying in bed at night or you 

111
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:34,580
know,
reading a book on the subway or the boss

112
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:39,581
will sort of leave the bus and leave the
bad and be transported to Madame Bovary,

113
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:45,761
his bedroom and you're kind of as there 
half a witness and half a participant in

114
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:47,924
a story.
And my hope is that those who read the 

115
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,620
things they carried in my other books 
too,

116
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,933
you hope that they'll feel sure.
That identification thing that happens 

117
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,510
in a story where you're rooting for 
people are,

118
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,973
you know,
hoping the villain is cod or whatever 

119
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:04,760
your emotional take on there.
You're in it.

120
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:05,594
And not just observing it the way you 
observe CNN or you observed the Fox 

121
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:13,370
channel,
let's discussed.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,650
I don't think I've ever tried to resolve
it.

123
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:19,484
I think it's one of those things that 
kind of resolves itself when I speak 

124
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:28,391
about Vietnam or when I write about it,
I'm not my own,

125
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,970
uh,
selfhood kind of evaporates.

126
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,013
I'm interested in what's occurring on 
the page and I'm interested in what's 

127
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:39,974
going to become of these characters.
And I'm interested in the moral 

128
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,850
struggles they're going through.
And I don't,

129
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,580
I'm not like my attention is on the 
making of a,

130
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,623
of an object in a way,
an artifact the way a sculptor may look 

131
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:57,270
it up,
use of stone,

132
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,560
and you may have a vision for what you 
want that stone to become,

133
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:02,394
but part of what you do is it's the 
stolen kind of lead you to what it's 

134
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,193
going to become.
Vain of minerals may run through it and 

135
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:12,601
then,
oh,

136
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:14,700
that's there.
That could become this.

137
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,533
And that's been like writing fiction and
a bit of dialogue may pop out of the 

138
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:23,931
character's mouth that's unplanned and 
unintentional on my part,

139
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:26,010
I have no volition over.
It seems to,

140
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,943
uh,
Peter,

141
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,103
well I know that I'm coming from 
somewhere inside my head and my history 

142
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:34,690
and my imagination,
but it doesn't affect,

143
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:39,050
it doesn't feel as if I'm willing and 
I'm making it happen by volition.

144
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,160
It's appearing.
Uh,

145
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,760
stories have a way of,
of pulling you along,

146
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:48,030
kind of chasing the story as you're 
writing it.

147
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,790
And it,
it,

148
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,773
it doesn't feel as if I'm playing that 
old childhood game of connecting dots 

149
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,890
that they've all been planned and I'm 
just going to write sentences to connect

150
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,560
it all.
It feels more as if I'm on a,

151
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:07,030
on a riverboat and watching people and 
scenery go by and a novel or a story has

152
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:11,214
that feel of a,
of a voyage in which I'm partly a 

153
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:16,200
participant in partly a witness.

154
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,190
I wish I could say yes cause it sounds 
so much big thinking,

155
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,623
but it is the act of writing for me is 
largely the act of following sentences 

156
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:31,854
and making sentences.
And for most people that probably is a 

157
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,580
time to click off and look at something 
else.

158
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:43,581
But unfortunately for me,
stories grow out of a sentence.

159
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:44,940
For example,
the sentence,

160
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:46,230
this is true.
Again,

161
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:50,490
one of my stories I wrote the sentence 
was I had no idea of what,

162
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,440
what was true.
True.

163
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:53,910
In what sense?
I had no idea.

164
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:56,460
And I wrote another sentence to follow 
that.

165
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,620
But a buddy in Vietnam,
he and Bob Kiley,

166
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,610
well I'm discovering,
I probably discovering and a partly just

167
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,970
curious about,
are fascinated about issues of what,

168
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:12,804
what could be true and what does this 
character going to say is true and does 

169
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:20,010
this character really mean it?
Does it really mean it's true?

170
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,840
And uh,
to what degree does this character think

171
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:29,370
it's true and how could anybody say this
is true and real without a little tongue

172
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:32,220
in cheek action going on?
So it's a,

173
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,263
it's a discovery.
And what I think was one of my better 

174
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,910
stories grew out holy,
out of the unplanned,

175
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,720
out of a scrap of language is forgotten 
by readers.

176
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:43,554
I think that are largely forgotten that 
that are 26 letters in the alphabet and 

177
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,170
some punctuation marks.
And that's all we've got.

178
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,640
And that is what I work with fitting in 
my underwear day after day,

179
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,860
year after year,
I was 26 letters.

180
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,753
He's punctuation marks and out of that 
character is calm and moral quandaries 

181
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:11,761
are explored but in the end the work of 
writing and fortunately I was really the

182
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:13,114
battling with Abcd and that's comma that
so in calcitrant there are those and it 

183
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:21,514
doesn't,
it's not a function of age and it 

184
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:26,170
probably wasn't even a function entirely
of of uh,

185
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,600
education or political leanings.

186
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,200
But there's a,
there's a temper in probably America,

187
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,140
but for sure I know in America and maybe
worldwide for the literal,

188
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,563
a literal take on everything that that 
reality TV is taken advantage of and 

189
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:48,961
incorporated as part of itself.
And the literal take on things is a take

190
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:54,760
without irony,
without edge and without,

191
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,080
it's usually a fairly,
there's a certitude to it.

192
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,483
Why don't you write a book that has 
nothing to do with war is that that's a 

193
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:03,994
certain possibility and you should 
certainly try to do it as a way of 

194
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:10,120
recovering from the war.
And you want to say a number of things.

195
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:14,590
This is not just a book about war,
you idiot.

196
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,760
And it's a book about love and a book 
about storytelling.

197
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,493
But you also feel overwhelmed by,
by the knowledge that you're not going 

198
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:27,244
to get through.
That's the literal minded are going to 

199
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:32,500
remain literal minded and maybe someone 
else can help them,

200
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:34,660
but that someone else,
not,

201
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,153
not this guy.

202
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,410
So there's a,
there's a wave of anger or bitterness.

203
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,073
It has to do with Vietnam,
has to do with a kind of mindset of the 

204
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:53,941
literal all around me that doesn't fit 
my take on the world.

205
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:59,320
It's a,
in my experience in the world where it's

206
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:02,380
hard for me to take anything very 
literally boards.

207
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:04,540
I love you.
I have there as soon as they're uttered,

208
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:08,800
I'm suspect.
How much and when will you stop and will

209
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:09,730
you,
um,

210
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,170
in what way do you love me?
And what is love to you,

211
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:16,970
by the way,
is that forever or is it still an ex,

212
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,040
you know,
person,

213
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:22,720
passenger,
all this stuff complicates where someone

214
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:25,090
else's I will love is love.
And if you don't know what it is,

215
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:26,620
you're really,
you're poor guy.

216
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:32,250
And that's their take partly is to,
I probably,

217
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:36,100
I tried to skewer it at parody it,
make fun of it,

218
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,960
ridicule it and put it in his place.

219
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,330
Partly I'm,
I'm sympathetic to the literal that is,

220
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,543
I'm sympathetic with some mom is holding
a dead kid in her arms and how else is 

221
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:52,340
she to take it?
But here's my dead child.

222
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,110
And so there's a part of me that 
understands it and is sympathetic to it.

223
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,890
And probably the better part of me is 
that why,

224
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:03,410
where I have that at least at least some
capacity to,

225
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:06,680
uh,
asic much novelists kind of have to have

226
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:07,514
to imagine otherness outside oneself.
And as a consequence of my books are 

227
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:18,650
filled with characters who bear no 
resemblance to me and,

228
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,150
and can be villainous in ways I'm not 
villainous.

229
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:23,984
And it can be good in ways.
I'm not good that I think the capacity 

230
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:28,934
for,
for empathy or understanding goes with 

231
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:39,281
the successful book because you have to 
create other characters and other angles

232
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:42,044
of vision on material for the,
for a book to ring it ring with some 

233
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:50,411
kind of authenticity among my fellow 
soldiers in Vietnam.

234
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,463
I mean there was and remains to this day
kind of absence of that kind of empathy 

235
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:56,984
or a dead child as a dead [inaudible] 
dead Vietnamese woman or one of their 

236
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:06,080
legs blown off was a woman with goop,
with their legs blown off.

237
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:09,890
And it pretty much remains that way 
these days,

238
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:10,724
40 years later,
those same buddies I served with in 

239
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:17,861
Vietnam don't have much empathy for the,
uh,

240
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:24,730
so called enemy and I doubt they would 
be capable of because,

241
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,710
because that's there,
if you know,

242
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:28,544
writing the things,
they carried it write another book that 

243
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,230
wouldn't be a,
it would be a much different book.

244
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,210
I ran into a kid in Seattle or kid,
26 year old,

245
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,940
um,
at a book that,

246
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:47,774
a book signing and I saw him out of the 
corner of my eye standing in the corner 

247
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:54,890
and was kind of frightened by him.
Not In physically,

248
00:16:54,891 --> 00:16:55,760
but I mean,
Oh God,

249
00:16:55,761 --> 00:17:00,500
I hope it's not a manuscript he's got to
give me and that which is hell of course

250
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:01,334
to,
and the guy that finally this reading 

251
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:04,934
Andoni hung around and I could feel him 
out of the corner of my eye approached 

252
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:09,470
me and he had me sign his book and I 
did.

253
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,200
You began to leave and then he turned 
around and he said,

254
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:17,201
I think he knew my father.
And as soon as he said those words,

255
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,970
I knew who the kid was.
I saw it in his face,

256
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:24,971
his cause he was dad and that kid's face
who was my platoon leader in Vietnam.

257
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,523
Uh,
and he told me over the course of the 

258
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:32,520
next,
I don't know,

259
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,373
20 minutes or half hour that he had,
the kid had been searching for his 

260
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:37,874
father ever since.
His father committed suicide soon after 

261
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:42,240
Vietnam.
And,

262
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:47,241
uh,
had looked for his dad in very brave,

263
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,943
cool ways.
He had joined the army just to see what 

264
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:52,780
his father had gone through,
really become a green beret.

265
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:57,781
As soon as dad had been a ranger,
all this tuff snake eating,

266
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,210
you know,
the stuff.

267
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,000
And he had picked up my first book and 
there's father figures in the book,

268
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:11,030
not been always in the most laudatory 
way is in fact not in laudatory ways.

269
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,320
Well,
that encounter,

270
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,680
I mean,
if we want to cry,

271
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,543
if I weren't on camera,
I'd be a little tears in my eyes now 

272
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,750
because it's an example of why I began 
writing in the first place.

273
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:35,360
I don't want to touch people in a way 
that,

274
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,743
that stories can touch him.
And I had helped in a very modest way 

275
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:44,334
for this fellow to fill in a gap of who 
this man advantage committed suicide 

276
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:48,744
before they even knew his father.
His father killed himself when he was 

277
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:51,530
very,
yeah,

278
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,790
I think it was like six months older,
eight months,

279
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,460
very young.
Um,

280
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,920
encounters like that.
Remind me of why began.

281
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:04,380
It's easy to forget why you,
why you become a writer.

282
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,663
Letters I'll get from me,
the girlfriends and people in Iraq or 

283
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:09,990
Afghanistan or the children,

284
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,150
which all say the same thing.
Basically.

285
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:15,080
I don't know,
my dad,

286
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:17,660
he won't talk about it or my mom in some
cases,

287
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,870
but largely men.
And we,

288
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,063
I read your book and now I know at least
something and when he's carrying around 

289
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:27,680
with them and what do you won't talk 
about.

290
00:19:27,681 --> 00:19:28,514
And sometimes the book will be shared 
with the veteran and conversation will 

291
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:35,804
ensue.
And that is way beyond anything I 

292
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:43,710
intended hinder writing in that book.
I didn't intend to bring people together

293
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:45,020
or it's Darren,
I'm talking.

294
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,220
But it shows you the power of,
of literature.

295
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,054
It can,
it really touches individual people 

296
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:57,430
realize and the real world and 
contributes to their lives.

297
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:03,180
It does something to their lives.
Uh,

298
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,720
that,
that's what I dreamed of.

299
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,280
I began riding home,
dreamed of touching some 15 year old kid

300
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:14,390
and dubuque or some grieving mother.
And you know,

301
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,463
Harlem,

302
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,403
Eh,
literature makes you feel if it's any 

303
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:23,690
good,
it can make you feel a little less alone

304
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:24,524
in the world.
Someone else has gone through this and 

305
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:32,400
it gives you some late night company.
Um,

306
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,340
with your memories and your thorough 
literature is,

307
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:38,783
does touch people.
It's not just to be read in English 

308
00:20:40,251 --> 00:20:45,251
classes.
You can't physically put a person.

309
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:47,450
I mean,
I've,

310
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,570
I've often thought of what a cool movie 
would be.

311
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:51,970
For example,
if you go to a war movie and they out of

312
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:56,950
the screen come real bullets and you're 
ducking and you'd get a where it's not,

313
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,673
you're not shielded by the knowledge 
that I'm not going to die in this movie 

314
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:04,504
house,
or,

315
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,940
or at least that's not,
the bullets aren't going to do it.

316
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,950
Um,
and you can't do that,

317
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,813
that,
that you rely as you probably do in 

318
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,570
anything you're relying on,
on the human,

319
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,753
the reader or the audience's imagination
to just sort of suspend the knowledge 

320
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:27,610
that I'm not going to die inside this 
book or at this movie.

321
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,403
But you have almost start to seduce the 
reader or the audience into almost 

322
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:35,824
forgetting that,
almost forgetting that feel of danger 

323
00:21:38,281 --> 00:21:41,560
and,
and a good work of art.

324
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:45,220
There's a movie called the Messenger 
that's recently come out about the,

325
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,790
with Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster.
It's,

326
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,070
and it's not,
it's a war movie and away,

327
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,933
although none of it happens in war.
It's the notification of next of kin 

328
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,480
where they knock on doors and say,
your son's dad or your husband's gone.

329
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,401
And although,
you know,

330
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:02,410
in the theater,
it's not just,

331
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,360
you know,
they're actors and so on.

332
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,003
There's a bluntness and a brutality in a
horror to it that some of those way 

333
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:14,620
beyond John Wayne stuff and the actual 
war stuff,

334
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:17,590
which has a,
you kind of expect what's coming.

335
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:18,424
And so Laura,
people are going to die and you harden 

336
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,490
yourself to it and they do.

337
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:25,920
It's a different experience to watch 
those knuckles on the door and that fate

338
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,460
door open.
And if that face,

339
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,640
that person die in front of you,
that mother,

340
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,460
um,
that,

341
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,440
that is,
um,

342
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,300
what are just for,
that's what it's for.

343
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,163
It's for cutting through rhetoric and 
cutting through politics and cutting 

344
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:49,980
through convention to,
uh,

345
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,513
open a trap door in your soul,
the avowed purposes behind our or 

346
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,810
preemptive in more and Iraq or let's get
rid of weapons of mass destruction.

347
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,420
I think I'm pretty clear on my memory on
that.

348
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:09,670
Well,
there weren't any,

349
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,100
and it's a bit like,
let's go to war because we were attacked

350
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:15,934
at Pearl Harbor.
It's a Pearl Harbor hadn't happened and 

351
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:22,600
I'm astonished that this large seemed 
largely forgotten.

352
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,450
Seems are raced from the public 
discourse about the war.

353
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,333
I don't hear many people going on 
television saying we went to war for 

354
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:31,810
reasons that didn't exist.

355
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,633
I don't,
I don't feel any outrage coming from 

356
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:36,610
anybody I hadn't done.
And I don't,

357
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,220
not only do I not feel it now,
I never felt it.

358
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,373
Um,
I find that stunning and I do here 

359
00:23:46,011 --> 00:23:47,180
instead as well.
We,

360
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,570
we got rid of a tyrant,
Saddam Hussein.

361
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,050
The problem with that is that in the 
first place,

362
00:23:54,051 --> 00:23:56,450
that wasn't the reason we went to war.
They didn't do know,

363
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,523
didn't go before.
The United Nations is saying let's get 

364
00:23:58,911 --> 00:23:59,744
rid of a tyrant.
He went before saying their weapons of 

365
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:01,634
mass destruction and there was no 
tyranny stuff there except in the most 

366
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:08,720
second hand and trivialized kind of way 
more.

367
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,920
But beyond that,
there's a thing called consistency.

368
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,200
And there's another thing called 
hypocrisy.

369
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,620
And if the object is to get rid of 
tyrants around the world,

370
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:24,190
why aren't we nuking Red Shyna what we 
used to let the Republicans used to call

371
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:25,064
Red China and why aren't we at war with 
half the countries in Latin America and 

372
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:32,030
why aren't we taking half the countries 
in Africa if not more than half?

373
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,113
Um,
and there are no answers to those 

374
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:38,354
questions.
Sort of Cherry pick your war and go get 

375
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:44,780
rid of that tyrant.
And then there's the question of ty,

376
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,180
ty origin,
whose eyes,

377
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,500
I mean,
and what if for example,

378
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:52,334
al Qaeda were to declare a George Bush 
is a tyrant and we're going to attack 

379
00:24:57,231 --> 00:24:58,640
you or are we all going to say,
okay,

380
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,540
come tax us.
It's okay to attack tyrants.

381
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,490
Who declares that the tire.
It is who we are.

382
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,343
Well we have,
we've been elected as a country to 

383
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:10,010
decide who the tyrants are and who the 
good guys are.

384
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,133
Um,
those are complicated questions and 

385
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:16,520
they're not addressed and not even 
looked at anymore.

386
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,081
And,
uh,

387
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,220
it,
it,

388
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,380
that's part of where my frustration 
comes,

389
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:22,410
I think in,
uh,

390
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,893
writing about this subject is I feel 
that things have been de elevated in 

391
00:25:29,971 --> 00:25:33,470
that the discourse is aimed at a really 
low,

392
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,333
low,
low place and difficult questions are 

393
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,050
not just not answered.
They're not even asked.

394
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,023
And they aren't asked by,
don't seem to have been asked by the 

395
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,170
people who uttering the bellicose 
rhetoric of war.

396
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,360
You seem to be alighted innovated.

397
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,253
Um,
and then there's the final issue that 

398
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:00,320
kind of attend your question,
which is the issue of personal,

399
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,910
I don't know how to phrase this,
but a pr,

400
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,253
a personal commitment to one's own 
rhetoric that the rhetoric of 

401
00:26:10,551 --> 00:26:11,384
bellicosity that's or has surrounded,
especially the initial phases of our 

402
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:19,070
intervention in the Middle East.
These people aren't there.

403
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,510
They aren't,
I mean,

404
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:21,344
you know,
the,

405
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,340
the Cheney's and the,
uh,

406
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,160
the public face and the public,
uh,

407
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,280
explainers of our presence in a,
too often they're hiding their kids away

408
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:37,710
at Yale or you know,
or wherever and they're,

409
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,250
they're not putting their bodies with 
their rhetoric is,

410
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:44,760
it's one thing to sit in a TV studio,
you're cute bow tie and say,

411
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:47,520
let's go kill people.
It's another thing to go and do it.

412
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,000
And if you don't go send your daughter 
or your son,

413
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,210
they got to go and they've got an,
I just go there.

414
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:54,990
You gotta,
you know,

415
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,823
walk the streets and,
and drive the vehicles and risk maiming 

416
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:09,711
and death and the hypocrisy of saying 
it's a great thing to go kill people.

417
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:12,930
But if somebody,
you go do it,

418
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,340
I'm not,
and my kids aren't,

419
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:18,200
but you go do it.
After having gone through a war myself,

420
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:23,201
I find that that's still stirs in me in 
the same way it did 40 years ago.

421
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,310
Uh,
an anger that's hard to,

422
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,590
it's hard to keep my voice under 
controls.

423
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:31,520
I'm talking about it now.
Um,

424
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,760
because it seems so dishonest and so 
cowardly and,

425
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:42,480
and uh,
so evil than the end.

426
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,300
It is in part that and part to mimic our
collective memories.

427
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:53,640
All of us that,
um,

428
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,430
memories of strange thing that if you 
think about it,

429
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,330
how much of today do I remember?
Well,

430
00:28:00,331 --> 00:28:02,460
I could,
it's already abstracted,

431
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:03,570
but I've already hook,
of course,

432
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,930
utterly obliterated almost every 
syllable to come out of my mouth.

433
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:08,370
It's gone.
It's history.

434
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,800
What about yesterday?
I can't remember.

435
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:13,050
Every dish I washed,
every scab I picked,

436
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:17,240
every rich person I encountered,
it's,

437
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,103
it's every meal.
I ate three hundreds and thousands of 

438
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:24,180
them.
And I would say that out of my life,

439
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,620
99%,
probably a lot more than that.

440
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,390
It's been erased that I'm,
you know,

441
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,940
biliterate it,
erase canton.

442
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,950
Remember a detail and I'm not just 
talking about childhood,

443
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:39,260
I'm talking about adulthood and people 
I've cared deeply about it.

444
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:44,261
And I remember them and loving ways and 
yet have a few snapshots of memory.

445
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,370
And we hold onto those and we call a 
memory.

446
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,840
And that's memory,
that little remnant of,

447
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,460
of a lifetime.
That's what's left to us.

448
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,360
And we attach this word memory to it,
which sounds has a sound of encompassing

449
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:07,881
all but it doesn't and that's certainly 
applies to the things they carried.

450
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,013
I mean it's a book partly about memory.
The author of that book is an older guy 

451
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:19,590
and he's looking back and he's recycling
event from different angles,

452
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,720
sometimes inventing things as a way of 
seeking that which is,

453
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,620
is gone.
Uh,

454
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,750
you,
you've ghostly a good friendship.

455
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:38,961
Merrick's who stepped on a landmine and 
was blown into this tree and uh,

456
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:45,081
he's been dead a long and yet in their 
writing of the things they carried,

457
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:50,150
I tried to in some way resurrect through
imagination what his last thoughts may a

458
00:29:50,151 --> 00:29:54,430
man as he soared into that tree,
there's sunlight is killing me.

459
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,683
I know I'm making it up,
but I'm trying to sort of cast a light 

460
00:29:59,741 --> 00:30:00,574
on that which has been darkened by,
by a history and the passage of time to 

461
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:10,210
let chip keeps soaring,
you know,

462
00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:11,920
use it.
As long as that book is read,

463
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,860
that Guy's going to keep soaring into 
that hedge for,

464
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,330
you know,
under that tree.

465
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,183
And as long as the book is routed,
Little Linda at the end of the book is 

466
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:21,064
going to keep skating on that ice and 
little timmy will be in love with her 

467
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:31,951
and the skating along.
And that is what you don't,

468
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:36,214
you're not.
So I'm not saving their bodies and I'm 

469
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:39,820
not even saving the memories of these 
people really.

470
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:45,220
But I'm saving something.
I hope that's essential and enduring and

471
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:46,054
the human spirit,
the love of a little boy for a little 

472
00:30:48,821 --> 00:30:53,500
girl and a good friend who soared into a
tree and a terrible war.

473
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,350
And that's something,
it's not everything,

474
00:30:56,351 --> 00:31:01,351
but it's something mostly pissed off.
I mean,

475
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:03,004
I'm a come down on that side of there's 
a mythology that accompanies the memory 

476
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:12,820
of an event.
And by and large from my fellow soldiers

477
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:15,300
in Vietnam,
the mythologies of betrayal,

478
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,760
we were betrayed by government.
They didn't pursue it,

479
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,660
were betrayed by the liberal press.
Uh,

480
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,020
it wasn't our doing.
It was,

481
00:31:23,021 --> 00:31:26,680
they're doing the same way that after 
World War One,

482
00:31:26,681 --> 00:31:31,000
the Germans were preached to by the 
forces of,

483
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,100
became Hitler.
That,

484
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:34,720
you know,
you were betrayed after the end of world

485
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:37,510
war on Germany was sold down.
And by and large,

486
00:31:37,511 --> 00:31:42,160
my buddy's feel that why that a we could
have won the war if only there were more

487
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,600
people weren't killed and more women 
raped and more houses burned,

488
00:31:45,601 --> 00:31:48,240
we would have it.
Uh,

489
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,980
I don't think they're right,
but they feel that way.

490
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,690
I don't,
I think you could have paved the country

491
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:55,710
with the concrete and put up a big fence
around it.

492
00:31:55,711 --> 00:31:58,330
I used to have all these people who 
don't watch it.

493
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:01,240
There you are Americans and were 
Vietnamese and this is our country.

494
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:05,140
And you may have the concrete and the 
moms and the technology,

495
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:10,141
but you're not gonna win us when us,
you may have won a war in a way.

496
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,990
Well,
there's,

497
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,393
I think there were mythologies of,
of memory and my dad carried with him 

498
00:32:19,181 --> 00:32:22,810
out of World War II mythology of 
America,

499
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:27,811
the lone ranger and the doer of good and
the carrier of democratic flame.

500
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:31,054
And,
uh,

501
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:36,930
there was a head of undercurrent of a,
almost a soundtrack of Frank Sinatra,

502
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,890
Gene Kelly soundtrack running beneath 
it,

503
00:32:40,891 --> 00:32:41,724
of buoyancy and of,
of virtue and the soundtrack that ran 

504
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:48,530
beneath the movie of Vietnam.
You know,

505
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,373
you know,
and all your people are going to watch 

506
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:56,351
this smell was not that I'll be seeing 
you sentimental journey soundtrack.

507
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:57,974
It was a soundtrack of the doors and the
stones and it was an edgy and critical 

508
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:08,120
and,
and a much more ambiguous,

509
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,360
a soundtrack that more or less 
accurately reflected the ambiguities and

510
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:17,300
the,
the,

511
00:33:17,301 --> 00:33:18,134
uh,
the absence of a certain moral 

512
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:26,990
underpinnings to that enterprise that,
uh,

513
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,113
so those are two pretty different 
edifices of what's called a mythology 

514
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:36,374
about a war and mythology as a way of 
eliminating all that doesn't fit into 

515
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:41,834
it.
It doesn't,

516
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,790
you sort of eliminate that part of it.

517
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,623
I think there's probably some truth in 
the notion that there is an insidious 

518
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:55,100
and dangerous side of the mythology 
that's surrounds Vietnam.

519
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,703
It,
it has a slight stink of the hip and of 

520
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:02,250
the cool of the,
uh,

521
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,720
walking the dangerous line.
And the,

522
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:08,840
uh,
I think there's a,

523
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,113
there,
there was an exotic feel to the war and 

524
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:17,790
this far off jungle and that was part of
them.

525
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:21,980
The mythology around it,
it sort of beckon is beckon is one a new

526
00:34:21,981 --> 00:34:22,814
to the adventure and we have my exotic 
experienced and dangerous moment that 

527
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,533
uh,
that manages to erase the absolute 

528
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:38,801
horror of it all the dead people,
the dead children and just the horror,

529
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:42,963
um,
that maybe part of what every writer 

530
00:34:46,341 --> 00:34:47,174
about war is finally had to come to 
terms with in one way or another that 

531
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,150
they're pretty great books had been 
written,

532
00:34:53,151 --> 00:34:53,984
including the Iliad and the Odyssey that
haven't ended wars and Evan did entity 

533
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:03,790
appetite for it and probably won't all 
you always hope.

534
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,973
Um,
I this little son of mine who's now 

535
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:12,350
four,
his name is tad and he,

536
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,180
the week or two ago,
yeah,

537
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,560
I said I was going on a book tour and he
said no about what,

538
00:35:18,561 --> 00:35:19,394
and I explained what the things they 
carried was and for the first time he 

539
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:23,894
had,
he had encountered out of my mouth the 

540
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:27,024
word war in a personal way.
That is probably heard me say it before 

541
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:32,820
he said war.
I mean,

542
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,450
you mean really killing people with for 
real.

543
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,900
And so for real you said really?
I mean really killed people that I began

544
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:46,140
by saying and now people are getting in 
disagreements and trying to simplify it.

545
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,833
But the astonishment on a four year 
old's face that people are killing one 

546
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:53,100
another man.
He said,

547
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:54,803
for what?
And boy that was hard to articulate an 

548
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:58,550
answer to it.
I didn't have a header.

549
00:35:58,650 --> 00:35:59,483
You're know,
they didn't have an answer the answer I 

550
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:02,630
believe they had.
And it was like,

551
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,130
I don't know.
I don't really know for what.

552
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,050
Uh,
I was,

553
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:14,380
I was the lime of person who has thought
about this stuff my entire adult life.

554
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,800
I really haven't yet plumbed the for 
wetness of,

555
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:26,280
of killing people.
Um,

556
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,660
I don't know.
I don't think I ever will.

557
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:37,070
Plumbing one of the huge things,
of course there's,

558
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,160
there's no draft and the people are 
fighting,

559
00:36:40,161 --> 00:36:44,210
are in the armed forces out of volition 
and got her own,

560
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,120
we'll decisions.
And that's pretty huge.

561
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:51,350
It attracts a certain temperament that 
wasn't mine.

562
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,920
That kind of can do macho,
adventurous,

563
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,530
uh,
temperament.

564
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:58,603
Then of course,
patriotism feeds in very strongly as 

565
00:37:00,711 --> 00:37:03,090
well.
Uh,

566
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,423
that's,
that's a pretty big difference from the 

567
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,620
people who went to fight.
I mean,

568
00:37:09,621 --> 00:37:12,200
there were many volunteers.
Of course I went to Vietnam,

569
00:37:12,201 --> 00:37:14,050
but there were,
the bulk of us were drafted you,

570
00:37:14,051 --> 00:37:18,950
so probably more or less went 
reluctantly and,

571
00:37:18,951 --> 00:37:21,560
uh,
and my case a lot more than less.

572
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:27,790
And so the two wars are being fought by 
American soldiers.

573
00:37:28,191 --> 00:37:32,090
I need side that have pretty different 
temperaments.

574
00:37:32,091 --> 00:37:34,340
And I,
for example,

575
00:37:34,341 --> 00:37:35,174
did an article offer a big magazine 
where I was sent to Brooke Army Medical 

576
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,450
Center in San Antonio where the 
terrible,

577
00:37:44,451 --> 00:37:47,510
uh,
amputees or Sandton and burn victims,

578
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,670
and I felt great compassion for these 
young men and one young woman,

579
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,960
but auto,
they're miles there.

580
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,940
There,
there was,

581
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:56,774
there was no,
none of the irony that accompanied the 

582
00:38:00,831 --> 00:38:02,990
war from my,
my generation.

583
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:04,743
Uh,
there's no questioning of the rectitude 

584
00:38:06,771 --> 00:38:09,680
of the war whatsoever.
It was just,

585
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,760
it wasn't even a thought about it for 
far as I could tell if I quit.

586
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,713
No response to my question is,
do you ever wonder about there were no 

587
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:18,950
weapons of mass destruction?
Did that bother you?

588
00:38:18,951 --> 00:38:22,970
And the answer was in uniformly from 
many,

589
00:38:22,971 --> 00:38:25,250
many miles a flat,
no,

590
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,200
it doesn't bother me.
Don't even think about it.

591
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,530
But even that,
don't think about it.

592
00:38:29,531 --> 00:38:31,010
It wasn't,
there was just no,

593
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,290
it doesn't bother me.
Um,

594
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,193
there was none of the edgy feel of 
questioning or of ambiguity was that 

595
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:40,114
certainty thing we began with.
It was there and those young people's 

596
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:47,800
needs are horribly maim people,
horribly wounded.

597
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
But,
uh,

598
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,543
instead coming out of their mouths were,
were words such as wounded warrior and 

599
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,410
war against global terror.

600
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:05,110
It was going to military sloganeering 
had,

601
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:10,210
was part of their,
who they were and that,

602
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,420
that was one another one of the 
differences from my,

603
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,500
from my time,
one of the odd things when the guest,

604
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:18,334
they,
one of the great ironies is that the 

605
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:23,620
things they carried is a book is one of 
the things being carried around Iraq and

606
00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:27,970
Afghanistan and finding out that book is
passed around from soldier to soldier.

607
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,363
And which gives me a little bit of hope 
that at least they're getting something 

608
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:39,241
from another point of view and which was
mine and that,

609
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,610
that's,
that's good for me.

610
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,780
I don't know enough.
Um,

611
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,550
I saw such a simple minded guy.
I mean,

612
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:54,520
I just assume that in most ways there's,
there's no difference,

613
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,253
uh,
the faces here younger and the bodies 

614
00:39:58,091 --> 00:40:02,560
are leaner and because like the habits 
are better than in my generation.

615
00:40:02,561 --> 00:40:06,190
Nobody smokes anymore or very few.
Not Everybody.

616
00:40:06,191 --> 00:40:10,050
They know about the right foods to eat.
Everybody looks a little sleeker than in

617
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,283
my,
or the girls look prettier and the guys 

618
00:40:12,881 --> 00:40:15,310
look tougher and tougher,
but buffer.

619
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,780
Um,
but aside from that,

620
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:20,400
I mean,
I'm like,

621
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,233
fuck,
I can hang out with college kids or 

622
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:26,780
people in their 20s and feel utterly at 
home and in,

623
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,280
in a way that I don't think I could have
felt at home where I 26 hanging out with

624
00:40:32,801 --> 00:40:33,341
some,
you know,

625
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:34,540
it was Kurt Vonnegut,
her,

626
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:35,374
I think I would felt ill at ease,
but there was a poised among young 

627
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:41,590
people that,
uh,

628
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,250
really does astonish me,
really astonishes me that way.

629
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:48,380
People can,
can uh,

630
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,670
do something.
I was so difficult for me,

631
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,910
so I'm not sure what to say exactly.

632
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,450
I don't think I hate it.
I fear it more than anything.

633
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:02,890
It's uh,
because you're,

634
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,050
you're,
you're put on the spot too,

635
00:41:05,051 --> 00:41:08,500
are articulate things about something in
progress that,

636
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:12,790
that have the danger of freezing you 
that as you say it enough times,

637
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:15,130
I'm doing this and then you damn well 
better do it.

638
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:16,690
He started telling yourself all,
I've said,

639
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:17,524
I'm going to write this book and it's 
going to be that kind of book and it 

640
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,420
freezes.
It freezes you.

641
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,563
Are you,
you're reluctant to go beyond it or 

642
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,910
pushing another direction with the same 
book.

643
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,950
Having said that,
I,

644
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,593
I know enough about what I'm working on 
to say that it's a book about being an 

645
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:35,024
older father.
I'm 63 and I got these two young kids 

646
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:38,354
and I can say that it's about some of 
the stuff that I was writing about with 

647
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,330
the things they carried.

648
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:50,270
The sense of your own mortality is 
presses in on you in a war.

649
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:50,980
You know,
you know,

650
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,813
you,
you know intellectually you're going to 

651
00:41:52,671 --> 00:41:53,504
die someday,
but in a war you're reminded pretty 

652
00:41:55,671 --> 00:42:00,410
often and it was right at you.
And I feel that way is an older father.

653
00:42:00,411 --> 00:42:01,244
I imagine,
where am I going to be 10 years from 

654
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:02,781
now?
I mean,

655
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:06,800
basketball is going to be tough and will
I even be alive?

656
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:11,801
And um,
the two little boys or so,

657
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,270
uh,
no,

658
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,840
nothing of tombstones and uh,
no,

659
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:20,780
nothing of the tick of biology are,
you know,

660
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:26,080
are facing it as I am.
And there's a sadness to it that's has,

661
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,650
that's accompanied by an exhilaration of
the moments matter.

662
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:33,050
And I got,
I'm taking advantage of them,

663
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,190
which is what I meant earlier about 
writing that I'd rather,

664
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,313
I mean,
I could die tomorrow and I as a writer 

665
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:47,681
be content with four or five of the 
books I've written as being good,

666
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,390
but I can't die and be content about 
these two unformed lives or aren't.

667
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,583
They're too young to be good.
And I want to try to be there to watch 

668
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:00,290
him become good and to do what I can to 
help.

669
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,293
And,
um,

670
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:06,470
so I'm writing with that,
but it's funnier than that funder.

671
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:10,070
Funny things in it too.
And the discovery of language and,

672
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,913
uh,
the storytelling part of the book is 

673
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:18,110
about the stories I tell these kids.
Um,

674
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,210
there's sources,
uh,

675
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,190
partly in the world of now and partly in
the world of long ago.

676
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,130
What do I carry?
I carry a lot of years.

677
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,100
I feel that our,
that's not all bad.

678
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:37,220
It's partly bad.
I carry a,

679
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:39,043
what I think I probably was probably 
come through in this talk we've had 

680
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:47,711
today as a kind of delight and in doing 
what I do and a believer in doing what I

681
00:43:52,401 --> 00:43:57,290
do along with a sadness about doing what
I do.

682
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:01,970
Um,
because two decades later,

683
00:44:01,971 --> 00:44:02,804
I'm fielding many of the questions about
war that I fielded all those years ago 

684
00:44:06,921 --> 00:44:07,741
and said,
mom,

685
00:44:07,741 --> 00:44:08,600
my God,
you know,

686
00:44:08,601 --> 00:44:09,434
that sort of back where we were.
And then some that that's feels like a 

687
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:17,180
tangible burden.
Um,

688
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:20,810
but I carry with me these two kids I 
mentioned.

689
00:44:20,811 --> 00:44:22,880
And even though they're not physically 
here,

690
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,733
they are.
They're all around me and the person I 

691
00:44:26,671 --> 00:44:31,671
become and they're living inside me.
And,

692
00:44:32,221 --> 00:44:37,170
uh,
I carry a slight,

693
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:42,970
uh,
palpable feeling of obligation to,

694
00:44:45,451 --> 00:44:46,284
uh,
do justice to the savagery I witnessed 

695
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,750
and the senselessness of it.

696
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,513
And,
uh,

697
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,513
the,
um,

698
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:03,390
the,
the sadness of it and it would,

699
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:08,570
so that sense of obligation is with me,
especially on occasion is like,

700
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:13,650
like this one we're doing,
trying to talk lucidly about this stuff.

701
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:15,403
After you do justice to chip,
I muddy and to the ghosts of the dead 

702
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,393
Vietnamese and get Americans,
especially their mothers and dads who 

703
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:30,660
are still bearing the burden,
even though their kids are along that,

704
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:31,494
I doubt they go to sleep many nights 
without some poor woman in Orlando or 

705
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:37,243
remembering or,
or Sana 40 years ago that she never got 

706
00:45:40,561 --> 00:45:45,561
the ever hold again and there.
That's pretty solid,

707
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:47,970
solemn obligation.
