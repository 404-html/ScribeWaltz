1
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,900
Is anyone here knows?
She just generally by raise of hands,

2
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:23,901
how many people were present before she
tell the Chinese journalists in 2004,

3
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,700
the Chinese government distributed
document 11 to Chinese news agents

4
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:37,370
around the country telling them to not
cover the 15th anniversary of the

5
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:42,080
Tiananmen Square massacre
was,

6
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,500
had a meeting where a document level of
disgust,

7
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:47,580
he took those,
type them up and then set them off to a

8
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:52,581
New York based Pro Democracy Ngo.
She acts with not just one of the

9
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,550
expression,
but it was also an effort to undermine

10
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:59,850
the propaganda by a,
uh,

11
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,750
by an infested regime.

12
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,870
One of the things that she does cover is
the degree to which the Chinese

13
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:14,870
government thinks about censorship as
engineers who are thinking about a day.

14
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,790
I'm very politically contentious
moments.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,880
They raised the dam to pay very close
attention to what's going on.

16
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,820
And during liberal periods they let it
go.

17
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,250
Um,
obviously you're an anniversary of the

18
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,830
canvas,
but messenger is a pretty contentious

19
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:35,070
pack and they're going to be paying very
close attention.

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,780
So for instance,
if you send an email with the year 1989

21
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,780
as your username,
if you're going to pay attention to

22
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:44,880
that,
if you're sending state secrets about a

23
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:49,890
documentary revealing of propaganda,
a strategy to have political opponent,

24
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,390
United States of America,
they're going to pay attention to that.

25
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,420
They picked up a,
she passed email and they asked Yahoo to

26
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,420
reveal the user information for this
email address from a very tiny second.

27
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,830
We know she has ip address,
we know she tells a email.

28
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:18,291
This email was sent from a Chicago
address because

29
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,160
God gave it over to the state security
apparatus and she had was condemned to

30
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,850
10 years in prison where he is right.
And there's a real question about how

31
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,810
should,
as United States citizens as residents

32
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:44,610
of the West,
we react to the United States.

33
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:47,220
Congress had one answer.
They have a series of hearings and the

34
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:50,910
inquiries into this during the Sciatica
who was less than forthcoming.

35
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,360
And those hearings culminated in a
northerly anxious tongue lashing by a

36
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,750
representative in the WHO's has
particular experience with oppressive

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,320
regimes.
Representative Lantos,

38
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,590
the only surviving member of the
congress.

39
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,800
Um,
who,

40
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,693
uh,
the

41
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,380
conquer
that

42
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,250
game
Herrmann I by the night

43
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,120
jumping
off the matter would not all

44
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,590
what happened,
but I really don't believe that way that

45
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,170
would
lead

46
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,470
me
to

47
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,040
say that we haven't tightened up that
whole lot better than me.

48
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,250
You don't have a
whole lot better.

49
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,330
And like I understand that comment
at the end of the day,

50
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,640
I
have the highlight

51
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,730
in an environment that is very cool

52
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,750
said to the
police,

53
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,010
which pretty much everyone agreed with
except the actual tickets.

54
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,310
Anyway.
We are currently facing a similarly

55
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,460
complex situation,
be enough

56
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,940
as issued a circular which we don't have
access to perhaps because of that have

57
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,100
been translated in English perhaps
because it hasn't made its way out of

58
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:28,030
the country,
but the circular.

59
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:33,730
It's bloggers from creating posts which
the government says incite violence or

60
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:38,971
crime undermine national security,
including inaccurate information or

61
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,970
disclose eight secrets.
And the real question,

62
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,790
I mean there are really two questions.
The first is,

63
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,910
should we ask stakes,
residence,

64
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,640
attempt to change the situation or
attempt to protect the privacy

65
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:59,390
information of medicines who are based
in are going to break it down to right

66
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:01,190
now.
That's something everyone is going to be

67
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:03,980
able to answer on their own in their own
teams and the second half of this

68
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:08,750
presentation,
the question I'm going to try to explain

69
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:12,380
the answers to is what we can do.

70
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,360
If we say yes,
we should change.

71
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,660
Yes,
we should go and attempt to use every

72
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,020
power that we have,
every course that we have to protect the

73
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,840
privacy of political dissidents in
China.

74
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,940
So the funnel,
our thoughts on this,

75
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,090
I'm gonna have to defer to professor
Lawrence Lessig who lays out for

76
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,710
metaphors for regulating the content of
flow of human behavior on the Internet

77
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,430
because it's obviously a challenge as to
whether these categories are distinct

78
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,810
all the time.
I mean,

79
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,280
they're definitely learned often as we
learned in law school,

80
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:55,330
but these are the basic or factors that
I want or that I suggest all of you

81
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:59,320
think about in determining what your
team's solution is going to lead to.

82
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,900
This problem and what you think
everyone's collective solution should be

83
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,330
for the problem that we're going to
introduce the second half of the class

84
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,190
norms,
mind,

85
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,660
law and code.

86
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,120
Have you guys another 10 seconds just to
look through it.

87
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,480
If there's any questions on this,
feel free to raise them right now.

88
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,770
All right.
I guess we're pretty familiar with this

89
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:23,690
framework.
So we'll move on to the global network

90
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:26,030
initiative.
Local network initiative as a sort of

91
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:31,031
voluntary guidelines which the Internet
companies a specific signatory,

92
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:36,521
Jerry Yang will get harangued by
representative who they sign onto a

93
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:42,440
series of principles,
guidelines and a framework for going

94
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:45,980
forward,
documenting and streamlining the process

95
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,190
by which they interact with the pressing
machines who request private information

96
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,410
of otherwise anonymous for,
uh,

97
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,880
individuals with pseudonyms,
a political dissidents in trunk while

98
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,010
we're political dissidents and across
the world.

99
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,030
Uh,
so we're gonna start with whatever

100
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,640
condition and hopefully by discussing
the details and getting into the

101
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:14,330
language of this framework,
we can massage out some of the benefits

102
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:16,630
and tensions of this,
uh,

103
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:17,683
of this.
Uh,

104
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,090
so we started off with three basic
elements of the global network

105
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,030
initiative,
sort of principles,

106
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:27,280
which are general aspirations and goals,
the ideals of the signatories,

107
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:31,340
Google and Yahoo have signed onto this,
a bending implementation guidelines

108
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,750
which are the real meat and potatoes,
the specifics which these companies have

109
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,480
agreed to,
and this framework by the way,

110
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:42,560
it was set up as a negotiation between
academics,

111
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,750
these companies and human rights groups
mentioned.

112
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,750
And then finally the governance
accountability and learning framework.

113
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,110
A plan for putting this framework into
motion over what is now the next four

114
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:58,090
years.
So we're going to just start off with a

115
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,830
basic understanding of how these
principles,

116
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,190
the principles are founded upon,
or at least with respect to privacy.

117
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,740
Privacy principles are kind of two basic
claims.

118
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,560
A two basic assertions,
one that privacy is a human right to

119
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,090
privacy is a guarantor of human dignity.
From here,

120
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,170
the guys move on to a series of ships,
some ideals about what,

121
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,490
what,
what these companies are aspiring to be.

122
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:25,324
A part

123
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,830
starts off with.
Everyone should be free from illegal

124
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,980
arbitrary interference with the right to
privacy and should have the right to the

125
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:35,100
protection of the law.
Again,

126
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,140
such interference or a test,
right?

127
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,140
Privacy should not be restricted by
governments excepted narrowly defined

128
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,890
circumstances based on getting actually
recognized laws and standards and these

129
00:09:45,891 --> 00:09:48,680
restrictions should be consistent with
international human rights.

130
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,250
Now he's principles are so wide,
so broad in terms of what we can imagine

131
00:09:56,331 --> 00:09:59,960
their applicability to be that they are
inevitably going to be somewhat watered

132
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:02,240
down when we get to the real specifics.
In fact,

133
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:07,241
just by highlighting this principles,
a g and I framers were telling us these

134
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:13,010
are not specific to which we should hold
these Internet companies accountable.

135
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,150
Those specifics are going to come.
Any implementation guidelines still

136
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,360
there is something to point out in terms
of watering down

137
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,640
shaded in gray except the narrowly
defined a circumstance.

138
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,090
The face,
I'm internationally recognized

139
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,450
standards,
so on the one hand the principals

140
00:10:29,451 --> 00:10:31,640
generally close the door on privacy
invasions,

141
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,990
but they always open windows and whether
or not you think this is a good tactic

142
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:38,960
in terms of what kind of Lsd you all
want to prep,

143
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,620
what kind of approach you want to take
to solve the problem,

144
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,380
and it's up to you.
This is one of the things that I thought

145
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,130
was important to flag and the principal
section will be on implementation

146
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,560
guidelines.
I think it's just important to take a

147
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:57,890
look at the kind of language which the
implementation guidelines to use.

148
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,390
This is just a section of implementation
guidelines,

149
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:05,120
just like I like the kind of language of
uses a,

150
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,810
so they're going to receive and evaluate
regular reports for management.

151
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,320
We're going to review and they're going
to participate in training.

152
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,170
All of these words are rather
subjective.

153
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,450
What does review mean?
What does receive mean?

154
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,650
What is participating in ultimately that
is determined by WHO's interpreting it.

155
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:29,210
These are voluntary guidelines.
Have anything to just specific words

156
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:34,390
might or might not have an effect.
As we saw in Lauren's less extreme work,

157
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,720
he's will certainly affect norms that a
potentially will affect markets.

158
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,430
Therefore in terms of what he see these
Internet companies doing and me hold

159
00:11:43,431 --> 00:11:48,431
them up to certain norms either by
shaming them or by using our power as

160
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:51,830
consumers.
That's going to determine how effective

161
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,370
the wording is.
Any implementation guidelines.

162
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,930
So that said,
I've given out a packet to everyone and

163
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:02,280
I want you to take a look at the privacy
section of the implementation guidelines

164
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,830
now that you have a sense not only of
the principals but also the general

165
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,950
approaches the implementation guidelines
take.

166
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,430
I want you to read through those privacy
guidelines and judge for yourself how

167
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,760
effective they are and whether or not
that would change the approach when you

168
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:20,260
have a chance to do what they've done in
about 40 minutes.

169
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,970
We'll give you guys about a minute and a
half to do that.

170
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,350
Alright,
so moving on,

171
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:42,060
we're going to move onto the global
online freedom act,

172
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,470
which is a legislative attempts to use
law to create a different approach that

173
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,800
solves the same problem.
Uh,

174
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:56,170
so the global online freedom act was
introduced by representative Chris Smith

175
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,350
and it uses a rather more objective
approach to a certain degree.

176
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:03,590
That might be because of the negative
language that these groups cannot do

177
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,671
that.
On the other hand,

178
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:07,010
it might be because a judge would be
interpreting,

179
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,210
locate elective or obtain personally
identifiable information,

180
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:13,963
the

181
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,900
global online freedom that does run
through the State Department,

182
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,080
which only recently has raised a Snafu,
have a bit of an obstacle to the

183
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:29,630
enforcement of the globe on my freedom
back,

184
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,530
which by the way,
it's only been asked the past in the

185
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:36,531
house was not passing the Senate.
So there's not long and that's that the

186
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:40,100
secretary of state has explicitly said
that human rights are going to be

187
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:42,500
secondary to economic survival during
the recession.

188
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,830
So that is one slight snafu with the,
with gofundme as,

189
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:52,170
as it's called,
is that it only highlights certain

190
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:56,180
countries.
Others through Ethiopia I read and

191
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,900
specifically Vietnam.
And that's a problem in America,

192
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,970
which I will go straight,
but they help quite a bit in general

193
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:05,804
what he does,
and I

194
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,990
know sometimes on this one.
So what do you generally illustrates is

195
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:15,640
that our own country has been
responsible for major invasions of

196
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:19,670
privacy.
The NSA most recently has been sued by

197
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:24,671
the Electronic Frontier Foundation for a
series of more into wiretap and is it

198
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,300
really,
are we really being consistent,

199
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,400
fair,
or is it just something that we want to

200
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:36,401
do to create a law that only applies to
other countries when our country might

201
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:41,450
be said to have binding
at the very end.

202
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:46,590
I'm just going to sum up by just saying
these are the four general forces that

203
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:50,210
you should think about.
Attorneys not only analyzing these two

204
00:14:50,211 --> 00:14:52,130
solutions but also crafting your colon

205
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,660
and with that we're going to move onto
the guest

206
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,740
is managing director of the Burqa and
sack the cofounder of the information

207
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:04,010
technology group at Harvard Centers for
International Development in teaching a

208
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:06,030
course this semester on the technology
and politics,

209
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,710
Internet control,
and he was very involved in the crafting

210
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:13,160
of the global network initiative.
Andrew Mclaughlin,

211
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:18,220
which we are trying to prepare early
connect with over skype for to Jack is

212
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:22,070
joining us from the left coast.
He's the head of the global public

213
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:24,870
policy at Google,
NC,

214
00:15:24,871 --> 00:15:27,590
your council there,
and he has also taught at Harvard and is

215
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:30,170
a senior fellow at the Berkman Center.

216
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,600
So I guess we're going to start our
questions with column and the first one

217
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:41,660
is,
what do you think the optimal use case

218
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,720
is for the Dni and against what
situations is it built to work that

219
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,270
well?
So first,

220
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,250
if I could just,
um,

221
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,660
thank you guys for inviting me here.
I'm sure this will provide a lot more

222
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,860
than my normal environment inside of
asking you to gentle.

223
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,550
I'm not used to being taken apart by the
class.

224
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,970
And second,
important to let you know that I'm

225
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:10,700
speaking on my own behalf.
Not officially in anywhere.

226
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,660
So we've done part of what we have and
what a lot of us to create.

227
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,680
The sort of trust that we have is
through a great deal of caution with to

228
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:24,820
speaking on behalf of the people.
These were my experience.

229
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,080
Um,
so kind of before it gets to your

230
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:32,300
question,
can I kind of just reflect on a few

231
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,560
points in that?
Please do.

232
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,320
And I,
I really wanted to highlight one which I

233
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:40,160
thought was really interesting,
sort of the focus on aspirational

234
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:44,720
language and to say that that was very,
that's a very intentional tension that

235
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:47,710
we introduced.
They're sort of on one hand saying what

236
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,830
can we aspire to and uh,
what's,

237
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,350
what's something that's realistically
implementable and ultimately verifiable.

238
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:59,590
So I think you're pulling out tension in
the beginning as a suite of documents as

239
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:05,531
well as see
that particular thing in that that in

240
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:10,970
particular is important.
So the question is,

241
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,420
what's the ideal case?
What's the ideal use case?

242
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:15,254
One?
Is the,

243
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,370
there a specific case that he's looking
over?

244
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,490
My,
it's fine.

245
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,920
I guess I should say
this,

246
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,050
I'll start off with a question for you
about,

247
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,830
about,
about human rights in general and your,

248
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,140
these packs.
Well,

249
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,900
if you'd like.
Okay.

250
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:52,610
So where thing.
We often talk as if there are,

251
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,863
there are,
you know,

252
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,970
big categories as repetitive companies.
Does it,

253
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,590
does it simplify things,
you know,

254
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,670
tend to refer to just google different
anyway,

255
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,140
or
should we,

256
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,890
should we try it aggravated

257
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,480
state?
She and I,

258
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,050
uh,
um,

259
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,730
so,
so it

260
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:35,250
was both of us decided to do business in
China

261
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,860
town experience and Microsoft find that
itself has been subjected to Chinese

262
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,550
content controls on a,
as a locally hosted service,

263
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,230
uh,
which,

264
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,930
which I don't think it's the,
um,

265
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,660
was that,
uh,

266
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,460
that,
uh,

267
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,360
any one of these companies trying to
Tino the government on its own is

268
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:08,170
basically at a massive disadvantage and
so worth it was a,

269
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:13,210
we try to aggregate together a lot of
market capital behind a basic set of

270
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:19,670
principles and the,
I can say in all honesty that this,

271
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,260
this thing was my idea to begin with.
So I can say what I was thinking when

272
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:28,140
you started this off,
the original idea was that there was one

273
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:33,141
principal that I thought mattered and
that was the idea that if we could get

274
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:38,541
the companies to read too insistent,
one basic rule of law process or

275
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:44,070
censorship,
we'd be able to introduce an element of

276
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:47,670
accountability and also transparency in
the censorship system.

277
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,110
So you got remember from a kind of
global perspective for a company like

278
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,670
Google anyway,
what Chinese,

279
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:59,790
what China does is an extreme form of
lots of student.

280
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,380
It's actually isn't an Obama in Europe
this week.

281
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:08,370
I gave a really interesting answer to a
kind of snarky administrating this

282
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:12,420
question about American exceptions and
one of the things that he noted,

283
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:15,300
which is absolutely true,
is that one of the things that is very

284
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:18,630
exceptional than the United States or in
freedom of speech,

285
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:24,110
we are in a global context and extreme
outlier when it comes to detection,

286
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,240
meaning speech.
It's fair to say that there's no one to

287
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:31,250
country which isn't really a metal all
as protected as the US is of dissidence

288
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:37,970
expression of uncomfortable expression
of last expression and certainly even

289
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:43,550
Canada or Australia countries which are
in many ways culturally quite similar to

290
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:46,240
ours,
engage in Ireland,

291
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,210
sponsored censorship in content in a way
that would be recently a

292
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,810
unconstitutional in United States.

293
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,793
So,
um,

294
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,960
so anyways,
so many new roles.

295
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,560
We as a company have gotten into your
commute censorship in Germany and

296
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:02,230
France,
Brazil and the UK countries,

297
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:06,700
which are democracies.
And in which competed successive

298
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:09,940
elective ordinance validated by the
ballot box,

299
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:14,860
have voted to moser maintain a
censorship machines.

300
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:18,820
So in Australia,
in classify broadcast content,

301
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:21,730
they've extended that stream.
Theo in Canada,

302
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:26,731
they're a national content rules will
use to suppress speech from outside

303
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:29,600
Canada and prepare the speech inside
Canada.

304
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,670
Germany suppresses a bouncy related
stuff,

305
00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:35,670
extreme violence,
um,

306
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,360
uh,
world,

307
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,600
uh,
evocations to go work.

308
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,020
Um,
uh,

309
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,280
you know,
I hate Fox News would probably be

310
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:47,030
illegal in Germany,
um,

311
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,180
and,
uh,

312
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:48,861
and,
and,

313
00:21:48,861 --> 00:21:49,500
and,
and,

314
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,530
and so on.
So he,

315
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,660
there are lots of jurisdictions where
you have to do this.

316
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,220
And what's different about training
horses that aids our democracy and the,

317
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,300
um,
the range of speech that is suppressed,

318
00:22:00,301 --> 00:22:05,301
there goes well beyond sort of narrow
defined categories to the arbitrary and

319
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:09,450
unpredictable a range of subjects that
they,

320
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,970
that they choose to suppress and
experience has shown that in China is,

321
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,610
it's actually a short winded zone.

322
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,290
What is censored is,
is much less today than it was say 10 or

323
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,710
12 years ago,
maybe even five or six years now.

324
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,640
Um,
but there still is a broad range of

325
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:28,000
things.
The shorthand of it use the,

326
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:29,110
a,
the,

327
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:34,000
a three season two teats or um,
uh,

328
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,240
are three t's and Tuesday's Tiananmen
Square massacre.

329
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,020
I wanted dependence to independence.
The first C is with

330
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,490
the last one is criticism with the
communist party's says central

331
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:46,690
leadership.
So,

332
00:22:46,691 --> 00:22:48,700
um,
those are the things that really got a

333
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,420
internet content blocks.
And uh,

334
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:54,510
the problem is that there's no rule of
law to.

335
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,760
So if we leave aside the differences in
political systems for a second and say,

336
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,550
you know,
what really distinguishes German

337
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:03,430
censorship from Chinese censorship,
what answer is that?

338
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:06,490
German censorship happens in an
accountable framework that's very well

339
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:09,270
documented.
The law follows the rule sets.

340
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,211
So,
uh,

341
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:14,240
in Germany there's a body,
a governmental body which produces a

342
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,670
black list.
Are Else,

343
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,750
is subject to oversight from different
parts of the government so that they can

344
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:22,390
make sure that this apple beyond the
range of things that supposed to be

345
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:25,810
blocking,
it's got 12 experts from outside the

346
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:29,590
agency that participative decision
making and presumably could be

347
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:31,840
whistleblowers and there was something
bad going on.

348
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,100
Um,
and uh,

349
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:36,550
the black dust itself is not published
for fairly obvious reasons,

350
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,810
um,
a,

351
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:41,800
the process by which it's implemented,
it's pretty transparent.

352
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,680
So I'm a,
that's one alternative.

353
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,750
The Chinese alternative though is
there's rule of law.

354
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:50,760
It's basically an individual decision
being accountable.

355
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,340
You're not documentation.
So the,

356
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,670
I cannot make the GI initially,
like I say,

357
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,080
because I first cooked it up was that
you should try to get as much

358
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,360
accumulated market capital in the tech
sector,

359
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,620
media sector and,
uh,

360
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,880
broadly speaking in the information
center and try to get them all to agree

361
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:12,500
to one second principle,
which is,

362
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:17,501
that really does follow a censorship
requests on Chinese in services and

363
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:21,490
actually follow the formal one.

364
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,840
So not for Prom,
not somebody just sending you an

365
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,610
employee to a meeting and yelling at
them to block something.

366
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,020
But if model document that's been signed
off by court,

367
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,010
um,
and again,

368
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,540
this could be usefully transformative at
least in some small way and that

369
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,360
requires some official to attach their
name to an order that follows legal

370
00:24:44,361 --> 00:24:48,440
process at least on paper.
And therefore there's a chain of

371
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:50,840
accountability built in.
Something gets why you can look at

372
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,210
seafood was that ordered it to be.
One of the things that the fuels,

373
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,090
the range of censorship in China right
now is that,

374
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,220
you know,
you can never really tell it's complete

375
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,740
black box.
The outside world ordered what and for

376
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:06,080
what purpose?
So that was the original idea.

377
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:10,160
I'm just one question to ask was better,
um,

378
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,800
it should take.
I think it's largely failed in that

379
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:17,060
because the only two companies that are
taking on Google or Yahoo and Microsoft,

380
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,320
there are a couple others that I hope to
see getting into the fall by the

381
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,500
stampede and any interest in players
where it's,

382
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,980
this set of rules has not really
happened.

383
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,060
And I think the rule set became a quite,
a bit more prescriptive than what I just

384
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:36,670
outlined because we also wanted to move
on your recipes others and actually

385
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,170
wanting to push the,
uh,

386
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,620
a formal requirements on participating
companies because they thought they

387
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,830
sorta had to companies over a barrel
because congressional criticism,

388
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,730
pleasure stage.
Um,

389
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,930
and so anyway,
that's something that I broke is going

390
00:25:50,931 --> 00:25:55,490
to be useful,
but it definitely has not lived up to be

391
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,830
the second vibe,
which was the other question you

392
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,580
mentioned google basically the same as
apple,

393
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:02,950
Microsoft.
Um,

394
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,910
uh,
probably not.

395
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,790
I mean we,
we,

396
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,400
we,
we are much for,

397
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,040
were much more conservative than the
countries that we opened up our

398
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:16,280
operations in a much more conservative
about the kinds of services that we

399
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:18,950
deploy and how we deploy it.
So in China,

400
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:21,770
for example,
we don't locate any personally

401
00:26:21,771 --> 00:26:24,570
identifiable data inside China,
um,

402
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,340
which is critical because even though it
means that our services are quite a bit

403
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:29,560
slower,
um,

404
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,030
it means that if the Chinese government
never wanted to get personally

405
00:26:32,031 --> 00:26:35,450
identifiable data from us,
they would have to go and file formal

406
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:38,710
legal process through something called a
mutual legal assistance treaty.

407
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,120
You are,
which means that it goes government to

408
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:44,510
government from China to the US,
which is Davis,

409
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,343
Ashley Stewart.
Um,

410
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,210
and then the US Justice Department is
involved with the same thing.

411
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,160
We,
we're gauging cooperation.

412
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:56,070
One of the critical things would be what
the Chinese government is going to use

413
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:58,930
this data for.
Is it a political dissident or is it a

414
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,060
child?
Pornographer?

415
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,820
Both are possible.
US would obviously,

416
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,810
I think one of the cooperate in an
investigation of the latter than the

417
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,120
former.
Um,

418
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,230
so anyway,
that's,

419
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:13,250
that's sort of what I know that a
powerpoint that you sent around with,

420
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:17,190
you were talking about Vietnam,
the announced example country where we

421
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:21,030
offer Vietnamese language services.
We offer them on adopt 10 domain name,

422
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:26,490
but we don't actually have any employees
or operations inside China that's

423
00:27:26,841 --> 00:27:31,170
probably different from who was a
Microsoft.

424
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,420
Microsoft sells software,
all the girls.

425
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:35,340
And so their online division to
probably.

426
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,360
I'm piggybacking off of this physical
presence for us,

427
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:43,820
we can be a lot more deliberative about
it and they're chosen to be a separate.

428
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,140
There are basically two things that
we're extremely focused in any country

429
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:54,000
where we're going to put people.
One is access to user data and the

430
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:57,110
second one is censorship.
And so we study a,

431
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,860
you know,
sort of study the hell out of those two

432
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:01,830
questions before we make any decisions
about weeds.

433
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:05,500
We're a data service facilities,
storage facilities,

434
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,410
um,
and uh,

435
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,800
you know,
all different illusions country by

436
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,320
country,
I will say on the censorship score then

437
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:17,070
what has been extremely challenging is
that because we pulled from the United

438
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,410
States,
there is no country which means us

439
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:22,760
levels of protection for free speech.
There's a single one anywhere in the

440
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,350
world.
So every country that you go to this got

441
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:30,430
subject each control or at least
attempts through instruments like the

442
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:36,461
liability provisions that goes beyond
what would be acceptable know and

443
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:37,680
kingdom,
for example,

444
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:39,420
it's libel,
defamation laws,

445
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,080
um,
uh,

446
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:46,470
and they just act as in order to do a
rules of the liability.

447
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:50,130
They act as the speech control games.
And that again,

448
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:51,450
was just a difficult.
So,

449
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,880
you know,
you're looking at a country.

450
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,130
So for me personally,
it's exactly accompanied view,

451
00:28:56,131 --> 00:29:00,360
but a critical distinguishing factor has
been about which countries have

452
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:05,430
democratic systems which are capable of
correcting errors over time.

453
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:10,080
So there's that I don't like about
speech restriction laws in India,

454
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,960
let's say a,
but I'm comfortable with Google doing

455
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:16,190
business in India because when it needs
to state,

456
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,200
which it sometimes does in the form of a
police arresting somebody who posted the

457
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,880
Oregon community that was critical as
somebody for example,

458
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,820
is of course incredibly dismaying that
somebody would be arrested on the basis

459
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,460
of criticism,
on the other hand,

460
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,620
a ideas democratic system for all of
it's a force.

461
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:40,650
It's a very robust wine in one with the
court system,

462
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,350
which at the top level is,
we've already,

463
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,000
this institution have a tremendous
amount of integrity,

464
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,200
a partial decision making and is likely
to be able to prevent errors as into

465
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:56,080
mature system.
So I think the profession is probably

466
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:58,690
unrealistic aiming for something which
is workable,

467
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,651
um,
is,

468
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:01,280
uh,
is more realistic and try,

469
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,650
just try some kind of balance.

470
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:08,510
Um,
so one of the things Andrew mentioned

471
00:30:08,511 --> 00:30:13,130
that is that ai is only all has been
going by too much.

472
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:18,220
The company.
Is that a metric to access your.

473
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,420
So it is a new prevail.
It doesn't have to be arrogant.

474
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:28,950
Are we to kind of
differences between people or companies

475
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,320
or how would you
respond to that?

476
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,930
First,
I would say that the official launch of

477
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:42,380
the materials,
which is to say the documents referred

478
00:30:42,381 --> 00:30:45,230
to in the presentation was in October of
2008.

479
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,760
A public launch was in December of 2008.
Uh,

480
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,980
we have ongoing conversations with
probably 20 companies.

481
00:30:51,981 --> 00:30:56,930
We've had a whole host of other kinds of
non-company participants,

482
00:30:56,931 --> 00:30:58,780
which pushes me,
uh,

483
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:03,320
academics and gos and investment groups,
but most of the social responsible

484
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:07,160
investors,
I think there's a lot more folks that

485
00:31:07,161 --> 00:31:09,170
we're likely to see.
One of the things that we've been

486
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:14,171
involved in is in drafting precisely the
governance charter and the terms by

487
00:31:14,271 --> 00:31:15,890
which you can become a member.

488
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:19,190
So the idea was not that any,
anyone would just join up.

489
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,520
In fact,
we need to establish that they were

490
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,910
committed to this venture and to making
it a success.

491
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,550
One of the things that each of the
companies that have been leading up to

492
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:32,750
now I've demonstrated through their
longterm commitment and meaningful

493
00:31:32,751 --> 00:31:36,140
engagement and actions and willingness
to address this stuff publicly.

494
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,010
A number of different ways that they
really care about making this work and

495
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,130
that's person not enough,
but a very strong.

496
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,240
There will be accountability.
It's other mechanisms,

497
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:49,370
but a very strong signal to their
success or their seriousness with which

498
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,680
when they're done with you.
And I had the other thing I would say

499
00:31:51,681 --> 00:31:55,040
that,
so Andrew referred to one sort of

500
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:57,620
differences among the companies that are
participating now.

501
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,850
Um,
what I would say is that indeed the

502
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:05,020
point since the beginning has been to
try to get a broader range because now

503
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,040
admittedly we have not succeeded in that
regard.

504
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,520
We did have a series of uh,
other,

505
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:15,580
other Internet service provider,
a mobile provider and telco types from

506
00:32:17,421 --> 00:32:21,650
Europe primarily involved in the
drafting process,

507
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:23,900
but the variety of reasons didn't end up
signing on,

508
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,400
uh,
we remain in good contact with them and

509
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,700
never kind of sorta considered we'll see
what happens in long term,

510
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:33,470
but the plan had been and remains to
ensure diversity and the diversity of

511
00:32:33,471 --> 00:32:38,040
the company so that you don't have folks
using one kind of technology or one sort

512
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,710
of business are operating in one
country.

513
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:44,300
But rather a mix so you don't end up
with technology specific or region

514
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:48,850
specific solutions that would not be as
meaningful or as a,

515
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:54,190
it would be sort of a to two specific.
Of course there's the risk of becoming

516
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:56,390
too broad,
but that will allow for some sort of

517
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,010
nuance in terms of meditation.

518
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:02,690
So I'm going for people in.
Your challenge is to get in not just

519
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,010
American companies.
This is key,

520
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:04,650
right?
If we're going,

521
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,010
we claim to be anything like approaching
global,

522
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:11,630
a drawing on the ICC bar.
New EHR is not so willing to have,

523
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,410
not just companies with global reach,
but companies that have values based on

524
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,970
non us and indeed non western value
systems.

525
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:22,020
We need to have a wider range of
companies involved.

526
00:33:22,021 --> 00:33:26,090
So we need to have a telephone,
we need to have other kinds of internet

527
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,820
companies.
We need to have the next Google or the

528
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:32,590
next company that the social network
would be another group or groups

529
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:36,830
involved.
So I think the criticism that we have

530
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:39,120
not scaled,
uh,

531
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,080
we are at scale.
Completely agree with that.

532
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,740
To say that we.
The fact that we haven't scaled this

533
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,190
quickly needs,
it's a failure.

534
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,290
I would say that's an overstatement and
that,

535
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,420
you know,
perhaps if Andrew had been around or

536
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:53,600
that we would have more company,
so maybe he'll help us get some other

537
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:58,601
folks to sign on if you will.
So we asked him to go back to window and

538
00:34:01,851 --> 00:34:03,800
I was just an idea,
just an idea.

539
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,110
Even if the had to deal with a lot of
people,

540
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:10,450
uh,
what was the process like a tear there

541
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:12,860
to sell it internally to people at
Google?

542
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,620
Um,
what,

543
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:20,020
what will be most conservatives couldn't
accomplish quality st death as yet

544
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,420
unfortunately.
Treatment,

545
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,430
what would it be concerned is what I'm
drawn out.

546
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:30,200
Most of the concerns with it.
It just to be too late and too useless

547
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:35,160
and will be sort of like a pr.
A fig leaf for companies was worse

548
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:38,320
practices than ours.
I'd say that's probably the primary

549
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:39,763
thing that we had to.

550
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,470
What's your biggest weakness?
You work too hard.

551
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,940
I just care too much.
But,

552
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,730
you know,
the,

553
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,140
you know,
the,

554
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,230
the sales job that we had to,
um,

555
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,660
that we had to,
uh,

556
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,080
you know,
sort of do one on the two guys who

557
00:34:59,081 --> 00:35:02,170
started the goal was to,
um,

558
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,690
you know,
was to persuade them that this wasn't

559
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:09,690
just sort of like putting people's
weight behind a PR exercise that was

560
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,700
more important to the other participants
that loves to us on the other concern

561
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,480
which was student process was on as a
publicly traded company on the idea of

562
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,630
having sort of outside auditors go
crawling through the company every

563
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:27,310
couple of years.
Uh,

564
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,970
to judge our compliance with standards
is not one,

565
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:36,910
it's not one that the lawyers who deal
with no obligations will

566
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,590
tcs to get back.
So we had to cook up a compliance

567
00:35:41,591 --> 00:35:43,660
mechanism which would be,
you know,

568
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:48,661
just recently trust building but not so
intrusive to trigger a bunch of alarms,

569
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:56,060
alarm bells in that cereal,
serial informational material,

570
00:35:56,081 --> 00:36:00,260
non public information coming out into
the public in a way,

571
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,530
that
kind of thing.

572
00:36:02,531 --> 00:36:04,800
You're not supposed to do this training
from.

573
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,200
Oh.
So I see some questions from the

574
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:10,250
audience.
Um,

575
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:20,460
so I've always been struck by your
observation that if you keep data in the

576
00:36:20,901 --> 00:36:25,370
US,
you can tie governance like the Chinese

577
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:29,810
government in knots trying to get to it
with letters rogatory and mutual

578
00:36:29,811 --> 00:36:32,840
assistance and enforcement trees and
such.

579
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:37,220
Because I always seemed to me that if
there were some data that the US

580
00:36:37,221 --> 00:36:40,040
government had reason to think that
Google health does it interest to the

581
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:43,390
government here,
and Google's answer was it's in China,

582
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:47,180
don't talk to them.
I think the US government would say,

583
00:36:47,181 --> 00:36:49,520
well go talk to this contempt citation,
you know,

584
00:36:49,521 --> 00:36:52,640
it would be,
you'd just arrest the people who are on

585
00:36:52,641 --> 00:36:54,560
us term and say,
all right,

586
00:36:54,561 --> 00:36:57,710
we're going to keep you in jail until
you talked to the Chinese and get them

587
00:36:57,711 --> 00:36:59,800
to give you the information.
And I always wondered,

588
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:03,560
isn't the same true on the training side
of things that they,

589
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,700
as long as you've got boots on the
ground engineer's there,

590
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,220
the Chinese can pull your license.
Current restaurant engineer's insert all

591
00:37:10,221 --> 00:37:13,730
sorts of pressure for violating their
domestic law.

592
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:18,650
If you failed to turn over information.
So how big a difference does it make

593
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,230
that the data is physically on some
other server?

594
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,360
So it's,
it's really good question and either

595
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,820
that better example than China's sale
because actually the facility gets

596
00:37:28,821 --> 00:37:32,690
indicted the head of our Brazil
operation because we were not

597
00:37:32,691 --> 00:37:34,420
surrendering a user,
David,

598
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:38,870
that was helpful on servers in the US.
One thing difference between the US and

599
00:37:38,871 --> 00:37:42,230
every other country is that because
we're headquartered in the US,

600
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:46,790
it means that all of the subsidiaries
outside the United States are controlled

601
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,760
by the US.
One of the,

602
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,720
uh,
the converse is not true.

603
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:55,670
The local subsidiaries elsewhere do not
control the operation in the United

604
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,503
States.
Um,

605
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:01,610
but even so with what with resilience
did was they were interested in getting

606
00:38:01,671 --> 00:38:05,900
data about people that they claim they
felt child pornographers,

607
00:38:05,901 --> 00:38:09,230
so people that were trading bad images
in working.

608
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:14,470
So I know that background.
Google runs as a sort of strange 20

609
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:19,090
percent engineering time project and
social working,

610
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,460
um,
which nobody in the United States a

611
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,840
citizen,
but especially in Brazil in particular,

612
00:38:25,841 --> 00:38:29,210
to a degree that no service,
the United States where they're certain

613
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:33,350
virtually everybody on the Internet as
we're good accounts and they use it to

614
00:38:33,351 --> 00:38:34,184
keep in touch with each.

615
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,130
I,
I have some theories about why that was

616
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,800
it.
It's awesome.

617
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,510
Brazil actually,
the Berkman center is at the heart

618
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:45,880
monitor them because three of the people
who were kind of like ground zero users

619
00:38:45,881 --> 00:38:48,490
for the Internet in Brazil were up 49
law.

620
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,390
I'm a add to Berkman center and later
went back.

621
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:57,260
This is our kaminsky ended up when all
of us and one other guy and they

622
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,590
certainly became a part of the working
group anyways,

623
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,590
so hard work it takes off down there.
But anyways,

624
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,640
so Jonathan,
I believe,

625
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,150
uh,
but uh,

626
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:10,690
so the working community sort of really
takes off and becomes a big deal in

627
00:39:10,691 --> 00:39:13,260
Brazil and um,
uh,

628
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,330
people were using it for everything that
you used the Internet for.

629
00:39:16,331 --> 00:39:18,160
Right?
So if you're using it to share child

630
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:20,500
porn images,
they were using it to engage in racist

631
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:23,090
tribes that were using it to,
uh,

632
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:23,951
uh,
you know,

633
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:25,490
do all the good things that you know
about,

634
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,970
but they're also easy to do the bat.

635
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:31,240
So Google's a posture has always been to
never engage others,

636
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:35,880
sort of control over content,
but rather to be a platform and respond

637
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:40,600
reactively when users flag things that
are against our terms are against the

638
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:45,130
law of this stuff will be out there and
it would often be there,

639
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:47,140
you know,
for law enforcement officials to capture

640
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:50,280
screenshots and then mom and
complainants.

641
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,610
And so,
uh,

642
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,290
there were um,
you know,

643
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,080
both things which were illegal in the
United States,

644
00:39:56,081 --> 00:39:57,260
like childhood,
you know,

645
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,350
we just did the letter,
um,

646
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,060
uh,
taking place to work and then there were

647
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:03,240
also fixed that we're not going to be in
that state.

648
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,330
So that would be,
for example,

649
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:05,710
racism.
So,

650
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:08,350
uh,
there were no police trying to pursue,

651
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,840
uh,
the greeters of racists,

652
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,500
uh,
groups in Brazil and angry.

653
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:14,740
We meet,
we read an impasse,

654
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,080
impassable.
We told him that they had to go use an a

655
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:20,920
and m black mechanism to get the data
cooperation with the United States.

656
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,500
They told us so,
you know,

657
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,370
we're gonna make,
we're gonna arrest her people in jail

658
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,110
and so forth.
And indeed they did indict ahead of

659
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:34,420
personal obligation and extremely
uncomfortable a situation for instance.

660
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,040
So we ended up doing was basically set
up a server inside Brazil and copies of

661
00:40:43,361 --> 00:40:48,361
child porn images and stuff worth onto
that server so that it's actually

662
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:54,600
physically subject to jurisdiction and
wouldn't be violating US law by channel

663
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:59,190
data
outside of the bounds of legal process.

664
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,760
Um,
and uh,

665
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:04,420
that's standard office suite works.
But,

666
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,190
um,
and we also,

667
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,020
you know,
if the problem is now

668
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:14,890
the problems that the United States law
speced specifies that that will be

669
00:41:15,911 --> 00:41:18,660
discovered.
A child born in HR systems somewhere.

670
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,750
He notified the FBI,
which gives you and that you're sharing

671
00:41:21,751 --> 00:41:24,700
that eventually a organization called
the National Center for missing

672
00:41:24,701 --> 00:41:28,220
exploited children,
which is a great organization to an

673
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:32,140
executive and financially and they do
excellent sort of forensic work out on

674
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:36,610
the Internet to try to track people down
and it couldn't trust,

675
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,490
but they'll also is very.

676
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,080
That is the only organization that we
are legally allowed to treat.

677
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:44,570
These images have overtaken.
And so,

678
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:45,380
uh,
you know,

679
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,750
we had to sort of go through a process
of getting a,

680
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:52,810
getting a kind of an okay for us to have
these images are shared.

681
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:55,910
We the resilient law enforcement and
impossible.

682
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,510
This is just a silly law.
It just needs to be fixed because

683
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:04,930
there's no point in saying that to us.
These are forbidden from sharing a legal

684
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:08,180
activity elsewhere if law enforcement
elsewhere.

685
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,560
Um,
but,

686
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:11,750
uh,
it was a question that you asked is

687
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,920
what's the socket just arresting and
invoice?

688
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,110
The answer's nothing.
I mean,

689
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:16,680
they,
they,

690
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,840
they did do that.
The problem is that,

691
00:42:19,841 --> 00:42:22,310
you know,
you start to look like a hostel and

692
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:26,570
unreasonable environment for investments
and for Internet companies to operate.

693
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,620
One advantage that we have is that even
police chiefs and government officials

694
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:32,590
in districts and countries like and
using,

695
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:35,000
um,
and find that it's useful so they,

696
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:38,370
they're often not particularly
interested in going the nuclear rooms

697
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,020
and pulling her licenses,
kicking us out of the country and

698
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,200
resting air holes.

699
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,350
So let's,
uh,

700
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:55,110
let's change topics a little bit and so,
um,

701
00:42:55,570 --> 00:43:00,570
say when you mentioned the foundation
Congress last term was paying a bill

702
00:43:02,161 --> 00:43:04,740
called Blah Blah Blah.
And that was,

703
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,800
that took a different coach than,
uh,

704
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:07,970
than,
uh,

705
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:09,900
than the Gi.
But for all,

706
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,360
for this question,
just all you know is that you're not

707
00:43:12,361 --> 00:43:15,600
anymore and I will never been.
I wouldn't say so.

708
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:19,550
Let's say the Congress instead,
he says you'll have some kind of APP.

709
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:23,280
It says American companies doing
business abroad.

710
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,410
He's accurate.
He sent me to a sign up for it.

711
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,020
What happened is that,
is that an APP?

712
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:35,040
Let's see.
It will be up to us to make it into

713
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,890
that.
But I think,

714
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,010
you know,
as of right now,

715
00:43:38,011 --> 00:43:41,840
it would be a little difficult to go
from having three companies and a total

716
00:43:41,841 --> 00:43:46,841
of 20 participants
invest with the scale required level

717
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:55,320
adjustment on one hand,
upside down,

718
00:43:55,321 --> 00:44:00,321
some of our notions with respect to
governance and cool and underworlds

719
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,290
firms,
they agree to participate.

720
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:05,370
So I think that's an adjustment that you
make in terms of the,

721
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:06,480
um,
but that's,

722
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,240
that's more process oriented.
I think in terms of the,

723
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,840
um,
the guidelines said the patient better

724
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,240
and so forth.
It would absolutely skill.

725
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:20,250
I mean,
this is giving me maybe for all his

726
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,310
criticism
as to the rule of law,

727
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:29,060
of course,
that's a significant part of the GNA and

728
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:34,130
to introduce process is where there has
been no process which has been a major

729
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,740
heading,
a profoundly negative impact on you.

730
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:40,590
Um,
so in many respects this would be a

731
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:41,281
great game,
right?

732
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:44,050
To have everyone participating in this,
uh,

733
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:48,900
a snap of the other things you do is,
is that as we have a greater number of

734
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:52,470
participants in more diverse markets
around the world,

735
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:56,520
it gives us the opportunity to have a
greater transparency so that instead of

736
00:44:56,521 --> 00:45:00,330
just asking Google to release this block
list or it's sort of statistics which

737
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:04,130
it's been,
it may be elected to do for,

738
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,700
it could in fact highlights behavior in
front of a certain document,

739
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:14,150
either compliance or lack of compliance
to aggregate collectively the statistics

740
00:45:14,401 --> 00:45:15,820
of the number of different,
uh,

741
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,530
the number of different companies to get
the show to both policymakers,

742
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,300
users,
activists,

743
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,440
and others.

744
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,910
In fact,
what's happening so,

745
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:28,710
so move away from censorship.
Censorship is a problem or a privacy,

746
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,050
your privacy,
your private information.

747
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:35,490
It's not really safe towards saying this
is how unsafe it is or this is how big a

748
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:37,620
problem with this is the trend.
In fact,

749
00:45:37,621 --> 00:45:40,560
we're seeing greater and greater amounts
of censorship or we're not really.

750
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:43,320
Maybe it's this.
Andrew says it's actually other problem

751
00:45:43,321 --> 00:45:45,690
is that is finishing.
So that one of the,

752
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,460
one of the sort of medium term goals
with Gsi,

753
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:53,130
which is the rule of law,
is to generate this kind of data so that

754
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:56,200
we can actually have empirical
information about what's happening and

755
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,880
that then a citizens users,
uh,

756
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,520
atmosphere organizations,
companies and policy makers can make

757
00:46:04,521 --> 00:46:05,700
choices based on that information.

758
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:11,470
So make a note about that.
So as censorship is not diminishing or

759
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,130
why should,
I think we're experiencing right now,

760
00:46:18,131 --> 00:46:22,450
a massive surge all fly expansion in
censorship.

761
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:25,810
It's not interestingly,
it's not happening in China.

762
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:31,500
It's happening again in a vast swath of
countries in western Europe,

763
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:34,960
on Asia,
Southeast Asia,

764
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:37,780
South Asia and so forth.
I'm sure you had.

765
00:46:37,781 --> 00:46:42,781
Your country is now attempting to impose
restrictions on the Internet in the name

766
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:47,440
of copyright,
in the name of child protection,

767
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:52,590
in any combat and indigo activity and in
the case of many telcos in the name of

768
00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:00,370
a differentiating services and,
and in a fast and slow lanes for

769
00:47:00,371 --> 00:47:01,890
different kinds of content.
Um,

770
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,820
so from,
from my perspective,

771
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:05,000
actually,
this is a,

772
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:09,040
a gathering storm seating.
And,

773
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,530
um,
I think for the US government,

774
00:47:11,531 --> 00:47:13,720
this is something that needs to be taken
very serious.

775
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:18,990
I'm leaving aside the exportability of
American values like freedom of

776
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:25,531
expression in the old tradition of John
Mark and John Stuart Mill Constitution.

777
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:28,970
Uh,
we have an economic interest in that

778
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:34,770
information center which generates a lot
of cash and jobs to be kind of embracing

779
00:47:35,431 --> 00:47:39,590
about it is this,
this is the single biggest trade

780
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:41,370
barriers we faced.
Um,

781
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:45,940
so I actually think that the perspective
of either legislation or executive

782
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:48,880
action for both,
there's a pretty wide.

783
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:53,050
So it's worth considering and see if the
United States can use.

784
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:57,350
It's a whatever remains our economic
power worldwide.

785
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:02,800
All in the service of freedom of
expression offer individuals worldwide

786
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:07,860
cause it's in the interest of our movie
industry or a TV or newspaper industry's

787
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:12,550
Internet companies.
And so we've all got an interest in

788
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:16,190
being able to move information without a
enduring.

789
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:17,170
The,
um,

790
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,410
uh,
uh,

791
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:23,470
many complex and expensive censorship
regime center are,

792
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,060
many of them are very well intentioned
that they're not going to traditional

793
00:48:27,061 --> 00:48:28,000
where,
uh,

794
00:48:28,001 --> 00:48:30,140
you know,
adults autonomy is not a,

795
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,180
it's not the prevailing value rather
than freshman social values,

796
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,180
um,
is,

797
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:39,910
uh,
so I actually just there another big fan

798
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:42,490
of the name which would be this building
highlighted,

799
00:48:42,491 --> 00:48:46,060
for example,
on an basis barely make it illegal for

800
00:48:46,061 --> 00:48:50,410
us to deliver it in an email message to
China because of the way it's written.

801
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:51,760
But,
you know,

802
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,320
even leaving that aside,
I think there probably are things to be

803
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:59,330
get you to try to raise the bar,
a little wall in center,

804
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:01,600
our trading partners,
uh,

805
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:04,300
to create a,
an environment in which our companies

806
00:49:04,301 --> 00:49:06,520
are edited,
uh,

807
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,010
regardless of,
uh,

808
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,940
of,
of censorship restrictions

809
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,630
against the background of that last
comment,

810
00:49:18,631 --> 00:49:22,770
which seems strong.
It's not at all clear to me why you

811
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:27,830
think that reliance on the foundational
principle of the rule of law is going to

812
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:30,900
help.
It would seem just discussed the

813
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:35,901
alternatives scenario for moment still
there because you just disappeared from

814
00:49:36,421 --> 00:49:37,450
the screen now.
There we are.

815
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,310
Yeah,
I'm here.

816
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:39,160
I can hear you.
Okay.

817
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:44,580
So the alternative scenarios,
one image you've combined the increased

818
00:49:44,711 --> 00:49:47,830
willingness of governments to,
um,

819
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:53,220
to engage in overt forms of censorship
with the trend exemplified most recently

820
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:59,341
by the Goldsmith book acknowledging the
technical feasibility of country

821
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:05,050
specific management in such an
environment.

822
00:50:05,051 --> 00:50:07,840
It would seem that the rule of law,
uh,

823
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:13,350
to the extended connotes open processes
of making an independent judiciaries is

824
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:19,240
not going to do anything to retard the
imposition of controls on speech.

825
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:23,260
It just have legislatures in Saudi
Arabia is saying actually we think

826
00:50:23,261 --> 00:50:28,250
sexualities and bad idea and the judges
appropriately commissioned to execute

827
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:31,510
the law say,
and we think sexuality is a bad idea and

828
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:35,840
we're going to clamp down on it.
So why is there any advantage to

829
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:40,841
employing the mechanisms of the rule of
law to resist the coming storm?

830
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,053
It

831
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:47,340
so is in
a structural answer of rule of law and

832
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:55,330
accountability and transparency answers
you struck with Scott,

833
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,070
unaccountable,
nontransparent,

834
00:50:58,071 --> 00:51:03,071
secretive,
the structural answer that answered

835
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,530
substances,
just social consensus.

836
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:11,730
As a group censorship,
that means you still also have to add

837
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:16,810
the substantive arguments and build a
substantive case why he should not

838
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:22,570
attempt to the memory of Kemal Ataturk
or protect community shake you.

839
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,120
I think that it's an answered you didn't
problem.

840
00:51:26,121 --> 00:51:27,720
And so I can engage in,
in a,

841
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:31,750
in a series of arguments possibly to
economic and diplomatic.

842
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:35,240
It's a to do subsequent.

843
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:39,890
Can you vote for questions here?

844
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:47,710
So now you've got a little bit of
background on the issues in a democratic

845
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:54,050
cross international borders and a that
we're going to make you do it.

846
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:59,380
So welcome everyone to the first
international conference on Democratic

847
00:51:59,961 --> 00:52:03,480
Free Speech Online.
It is a build on facts because we ended

848
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,940
up last week that,
um,

849
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:11,920
there is a recent case in which a,
a,

850
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:17,330
a Vietnamese missive to Internet service
within Vietnam telling them which sites

851
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:24,810
are blocked was given out to various
products.

852
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:29,840
We didn't have a staff member of one of
the Vietnamese Internet service

853
00:52:29,841 --> 00:52:34,841
providers blog about the list of blocked
sites on his,

854
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:39,260
um,
his pro-democracy blog published by

855
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,630
Yahoo,
which is the most popular blogging

856
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:47,650
service in Vietnam today.
That was picked up by Rebecca Mackinnon

857
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:52,700
global voices,
which is a popular,

858
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:58,310
a Franchisor of individual for an
auction,

859
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:03,020
bloggers around the world,
and that wasn't picked up by the New

860
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:06,620
York Times,
New York Times story upset that the

861
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:07,463
enemy is government.

862
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:12,870
Government in turn has come together to
ask them to give up the names of the

863
00:53:13,361 --> 00:53:15,050
people who were blogging this
information.

864
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:16,920
Now,
uh,

865
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:22,160
it turns out this is the backdrop for a
group of international actors getting

866
00:53:22,611 --> 00:53:24,710
together and saying,
we see this problem far too often.

867
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:29,910
We'd really like to come up with a
solution that's going to allow all of us

868
00:53:30,031 --> 00:53:35,031
to be satisfied with procedures that we
have for dealing with these problems.

869
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:40,260
So we are going that each of you,
your six groups,

870
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:42,000
and I should name the six groups right
now,

871
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:46,080
the government of Vietnam here,
we have a group of Vietnamese Burnham

872
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,840
auction bloggers.
You can just assume we're all wearing

873
00:53:47,841 --> 00:53:49,550
masks.
So the government of Vietnam doesn't

874
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:52,670
spot on and take them home right now.
Um,

875
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,280
the United States Congress,
a reputable August dissertation,

876
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:59,610
um,
the Board of

877
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:08,160
international and convincing just
because they like look up the shoulders

878
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,360
with their friends again,
China.

879
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,320
So,
uh,

880
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,110
right now what we'd like you to get to
do is take five minutes,

881
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:21,710
discuss what it is that you'd like to
see as your actor in and sort of an

882
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:27,090
international system for dealing with
these kinds of problems as they arise.

883
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:30,930
Each group should elect someone to act
as a communications director.

884
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:32,670
That person should,
a laptop,

885
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:38,060
then we're going to engage in two rounds
of sending people to other people's

886
00:54:38,431 --> 00:54:40,320
vacation is director or from various
parties,

887
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:44,850
negotiate over the agreement that every
part of the commitment.

888
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,600
So for example,
we would take amnesty,

889
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,760
Amnesty were to relax,
you know,

890
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:54,800
room to be director,
and then we send them over to various

891
00:54:55,201 --> 00:54:59,030
other groups can negotiate with them
over terms and everyone can agree with

892
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,490
to come back to their communications
director and to write it into the final

893
00:55:02,491 --> 00:55:06,630
document that Amnesty International,
uh,

894
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:10,350
we're going to have a second round of
meetings within the group.

895
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,850
You can discuss what you heard from
anyone else.

896
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:15,120
And a second round of negotiations and
then each group is going to present it

897
00:55:15,121 --> 00:55:20,121
solution and explained to us first why
it thinks it's a good solution for it's

898
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:24,450
so valuable.
Why Amnesty International in particular

899
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:27,420
sport the EMC solution,
and then liked good solutions of the gen

900
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:29,940
and it's sort of a desirable overall
answer.

901
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,900
So with that in mind,
I'm going to give you five minutes

902
00:55:33,901 --> 00:55:35,910
starting now.
She can sit with your groups,

903
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:39,550
discuss exactly what you're negotiating
strategy conveyed and I'll let him know.

904
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:05,630
So the idea here is that not only that
but also to win the vote.

905
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:12,860
Which solution is the best solution.
So when you got here negotiating for

906
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:15,460
your needs,
you're also negotiating.

907
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:22,650
Our first presentation is going to be,

908
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:29,230
you
guys want to spend two minutes,

909
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:31,730
why you for you?

910
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:43,930
Apparently I'm not so much into free
speech,

911
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:49,570
which is probably a,
but we're essentially DMTA style.

912
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:54,800
Notice the take down because we
recognize that

913
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,750
the Vietnamese government is never going
to allow us to just post whatever we

914
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:05,540
want online.
So it exchange for this Cape Town.

915
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:10,750
We were asking for the right to remain
anonymous and that will also get

916
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,410
immunity from criminal penalties.
And so why we thought this matter

917
00:57:18,411 --> 00:57:21,500
interest are interesting word that one
you have to post.

918
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:24,590
Um,
and we also though,

919
00:57:24,591 --> 00:57:28,310
we don't want to make Vietnam too bad
because we want economic growth.

920
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,290
So that's what I mean.

921
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:46,090
The second group that we got was a Yahoo
International.

922
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:52,610
We'd like to present yet
Yahoo,

923
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:04,900
the greatest collaboration with the
Vietnamese and the Chinese government

924
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:10,950
game,
the following solution,

925
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,510
finding arbitration underneath the
existing,

926
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:23,540
the World Trade Organization Rishi,
such that if the government has a

927
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:28,740
problem,
if the Vietnamese bloggers have a

928
00:58:28,741 --> 00:58:32,210
problem,
they can bring it to the attention of

929
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:37,240
his international body.
The governments will have signed onto

930
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:42,320
the GSI and principle and we can have a
binding arbitration's that uses the

931
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:48,921
economic,
carrot and stick of the WTO arbitration

932
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:55,250
per blog post.
Important general class action

933
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,370
arbitration.
The

934
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:00,300
details are that each country wouldn't
have their own boss.

935
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:04,840
That basically kind of caught up by
their interpretation of Gina.

936
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:09,520
Both Vietnam and China agreed in
principle to kind of aspire towards Dni

937
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,510
principles in,
in respecting privacy,

938
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:16,260
so in each individual case there will be
processes and procedures and laws and

939
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:20,520
the Chinese in China and Vietnam which
be independent and respect their

940
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:25,580
sovereignty now in extreme cases to the
extent that either party it the

941
00:59:25,641 --> 00:59:30,641
government or the blogger has a a major
kind of dispute.

942
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:35,700
There would then be in a process by
which the either party could appeal

943
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:40,700
these extreme cases to the WTO in that
arbitration would inviting under the WTO

944
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:45,730
of which both is there a two inch,
both Vietnam and China already kind of

945
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:51,320
our members,
the exchange of information.

946
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:56,321
Really a trade issue here
and that's that.

947
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:03,440
So the idea is that not that not only
not only respects the sovereignty of

948
01:00:03,441 --> 01:00:06,740
both of China and Vietnam,
which we think are paramount,

949
01:00:06,741 --> 01:00:09,710
but it also kind of creates an
international,

950
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:12,650
a set of principles that other countries
can aspire to,

951
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,750
which is,
which is what the Gi represents.

952
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:19,190
Hopefully this will keep other countries
to kind of start using guidelines,

953
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:22,930
guiding principles in addition to the
fact that it kind of respects the

954
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:28,240
privacy of the bloggers and the interest
of groups like Amnesty International and

955
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:35,210
finally,
truly I think we think expands the

956
01:00:35,211 --> 01:00:40,211
global economic high
nine zero seven transactions.

957
01:00:41,001 --> 01:00:42,170
That's what we're about.
We're

958
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:50,470
with launch with the WTO,
not for being a disciplined and being

959
01:00:53,511 --> 01:00:58,040
arrested for that,
but for having his information turnovers

960
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:05,390
in future cases.
There would be a procedure in place for

961
01:01:05,391 --> 01:01:08,020
dealing with situations like this.
You try to because that's extremely.

962
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:09,500
Yes.
Alright,

963
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:13,100
gentlemen,
the next up,

964
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:16,210
the Chinese have a presentation or
proposal.

965
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:23,010
I'm not sure I actually agree with you,
was pretty sort of the WTO.

966
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:28,200
Um,
we don't really.

967
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:32,660
Our main proposal is that we think that
countries should agree to adopt the

968
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:35,610
United Nations on Peachtree Hispanic
program being dropped to about

969
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,640
[inaudible] 70.
Um,

970
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,250
beyond that,
I think our position is that we're not

971
01:01:40,251 --> 01:01:43,100
going to have a sign on the agreement
here no matter what.

972
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:55,260
Basically has it all,
um,

973
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,770
as,
as an interstate matters from the wheel

974
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,430
bolts,
it's commitments to letting countries do

975
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:05,300
what they want within their own borders
and not having other countries dictate

976
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:08,360
to 100 dictate to another country what
they should be doing.

977
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:14,560
So
is there anything here,

978
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:18,560
but we won't sign on to anything

979
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:21,570
that we don't with that is imposing on
our,

980
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:24,120
our society,
someone else's.

981
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:30,790
So now no international arbitration is
going to satisfy if it's not binding,

982
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,150
said Cheryl,
we might sign onto that.

983
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:39,090
Fair enough or it could be like the US
and even if it is binding and we started

984
01:02:39,091 --> 01:02:40,740
going through and just ignore what it
says

985
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:48,100
that,
but that sounds reasonable.

986
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:53,010
The United Nations a q,
six,

987
01:02:53,011 --> 01:02:54,720
17 group life.
Yeah.

988
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:59,660
That's
alright.

989
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:03,620
Next up we'd like to hear from the
United States Congress.

990
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:07,890
So we realized that,
um,

991
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:11,850
there are a lot of definitions of state
sovereignty play here,

992
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:14,460
which is why,
um,

993
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,700
that,
uh,

994
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:20,430
we set up some sort of ex ante
procedure,

995
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:25,140
uh,
in order to determine what sorts of

996
01:03:25,141 --> 01:03:30,000
information requests are really
justified by telling me which ones

997
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,050
aren't.
Uh,

998
01:03:31,051 --> 01:03:34,930
so we propose a recording either a
committee or,

999
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,020
or,
um,

1000
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:40,770
an official within the US State
Department who would review requests,

1001
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,130
formal

1002
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:42,750
requests,
uh,

1003
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:44,610
from,
uh,

1004
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,850
uh,
the relevant government,

1005
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,340
um,
uh,

1006
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:54,480
to determine whether there exists a
compelling need for information such as

1007
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,130
a,
uh,

1008
01:03:56,220 --> 01:04:00,180
a realistic connection to some sort of
terrorist activity.

1009
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,850
Uh,
and if such a need exists to then

1010
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:10,910
authorize the ISP,
our ISP is in question to a handover,

1011
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,510
the relevant information to,
uh,

1012
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,630
the request and government,
uh,

1013
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:20,430
the ISP is,
would not be subject to penalties,

1014
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:25,730
uh,
in this country unless they hand over

1015
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:31,140
information that has not already been
authorized by the government.

1016
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,480
Otherwise,
the US or the US government.

1017
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,780
Otherwise,
all negotiation,

1018
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,730
uh,
all interaction interactions take place

1019
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:43,650
on a state to state level,
but all the information that would go,

1020
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:46,500
all the permission,
we'll go through this committee.

1021
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:50,060
So any information that was turned over
to governments that didn't go through

1022
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:52,830
this committee would not be authorized
by Congress

1023
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:55,890
government.
Uh,

1024
01:04:56,790 --> 01:05:01,790
yes,
with the symmetric interpretation now

1025
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:16,350
he had put in our original legislation
that we got some feedback,

1026
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:20,650
um,
many of these companies in a very

1027
01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:24,190
difficult position where they would
either be forced to define local laws

1028
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:29,270
are approved by our laws and we thought
it would be in the interest of bloggers

1029
01:05:29,471 --> 01:05:33,700
and democratic decisions around the
world to have the tool of the internet

1030
01:05:33,701 --> 01:05:37,930
at their disposal instead having yahoo
just leave the country for fear of

1031
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:43,500
reprisal from whatever dictatorship.
So we've got that by keeping this in the

1032
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:48,450
diplomatic sphere and by not trying to
harness the economic incentives that

1033
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:52,210
Isp,
we would actually be doing a greater

1034
01:05:52,211 --> 01:05:54,580
service to people who wanted to use the
internet.

1035
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:04,970
The American government wanted to get
information that will poses overseas

1036
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:11,450
against the wishes.
Say they're with us,

1037
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:16,430
recede on applying pressure of the sort
that Andrew was talking about.

1038
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:21,010
Contempt of court for those assets are
people we can get our hands on.

1039
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:24,350
They have a process like this place

1040
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:37,790
that's classified
the US Congress now Amnesty

1041
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:47,120
International.
So

1042
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:51,050
our proposal is based on this principle
that when it gets into trouble,

1043
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:54,320
a large number of parties who support
the rights,

1044
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:59,270
including a state and non state actors,
should have taken interest in exercising

1045
01:06:59,271 --> 01:07:02,210
all our necessary to defend that
blogger.

1046
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:06,890
So that starts with us setting up a
network of pro bono lawyers in every

1047
01:07:06,891 --> 01:07:11,891
country who works specifically with
local laws concerning speech and also

1048
01:07:13,281 --> 01:07:18,200
lobbying governments to strengthen some
sort of private right of action,

1049
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:21,740
which is worthless when you're a blogger
who's secretly arrested,

1050
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,620
um,
but does do a little something towards

1051
01:07:24,621 --> 01:07:29,080
establishing international norms.
We visualize the process is working on

1052
01:07:29,081 --> 01:07:34,081
those Vietnam complaints and Yahoo
alerts the blogger and get the water a

1053
01:07:34,581 --> 01:07:37,850
chance to correct false information or
pull the post.

1054
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:42,800
And I think we saw some agreements on
the idea of pulling the post and Yahoo

1055
01:07:42,801 --> 01:07:47,300
alert sauce and we activate our network
of pro bono lawyers so that this

1056
01:07:47,301 --> 01:07:50,690
anonymous blogger has some legal
representation in their home state.

1057
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:52,880
Um,
and then we'd have a review board

1058
01:07:52,881 --> 01:07:57,800
possibly based in the WTO that might
include a mechanism for anonymous

1059
01:07:57,801 --> 01:08:00,920
mediation between the Vietnamese
government and the blogger who's in

1060
01:08:00,921 --> 01:08:02,990
trouble,
although we know that there's a risk of

1061
01:08:02,991 --> 01:08:07,700
espionage here in anonymous mediation.
Um,

1062
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:12,730
the board could later can include the
TNI countries and maybe if,

1063
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:17,030
if things are really not going include
other interests in nations,

1064
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,950
hopefully United States.

1065
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:25,310
So the idea is that we can really just
make this issue explode on the

1066
01:08:25,311 --> 01:08:28,580
international level,
make an international incident out of

1067
01:08:28,581 --> 01:08:31,300
one nation,
attempts to get to a single blogger.

1068
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:34,010
I'm,
we'd also like to see an extension to

1069
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:38,630
the GSI that would mandate that all
these companies participating in

1070
01:08:38,631 --> 01:08:43,040
protecting speech rights online could
work together and collectively bargain

1071
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:44,690
with say,
the Vietnamese government.

1072
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:48,410
So the nuclear option would look a
little something like this.

1073
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:50,510
Vietnam says turnover.
Yahoo,

1074
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:55,100
who says no negotiations totally fail.
Things are going very badly.

1075
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:58,160
Microsoft,
Google and Yahoo unilaterally pull all

1076
01:08:58,161 --> 01:09:01,670
surfaces out of Vietnam,
which isn't awful for Vietnam in terms

1077
01:09:01,671 --> 01:09:03,350
of being competitive in a global market.

1078
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:08,040
Um,
I think that's what a

1079
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:14,770
lot of state right now,
so.

1080
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:17,840
Okay.
And then our final group is Vietnam.

1081
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:24,640
Sure.
So I'll start.

1082
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:26,360
Um,
we,

1083
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:31,450
we talked to a good number of parties
and that we feel very strongly that

1084
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:35,400
yahoo was obliged to turnover a blogger
on the,

1085
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:40,140
a state secret with a.
We do not believe that we move into post

1086
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:43,060
remedies.
The problem that we do with the blogger,

1087
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:44,750
no more than we gave.
Julia said,

1088
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:46,240
Ethel Rosenberg,
oopsies.

1089
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:48,640
I'm making that up,
that this is a

1090
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:51,903
no,
no,

1091
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:56,930
no more than anyone would have done.
This is a very serious matter.

1092
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:02,380
This is a,
this is something that requires that

1093
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:06,090
judicial system of Vietnam going.
The fact that we believe that we offered

1094
01:10:06,091 --> 01:10:09,450
you processed by our laws,
that we have all of the procedures,

1095
01:10:09,451 --> 01:10:14,451
that we are willing to comply with the
best practices of the GSI and for future

1096
01:10:15,490 --> 01:10:19,800
forward looking proposals including
modifying the underlying infrastructure

1097
01:10:19,801 --> 01:10:24,030
of the internet or have proven to WTO.
We were willing to take these proposals

1098
01:10:24,031 --> 01:10:26,970
very seriously.
We just joined the WTO two years ago

1099
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:30,660
that we are country with very low
internet presence.

1100
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:34,980
And so we are not willing at this time
to commit ourselves to a abrogating any

1101
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:36,660
jurisdiction,
um,

1102
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,800
and we are in fact willing to tell the
other if it's unwilling to follow the

1103
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:43,440
laws no differently than if they decided
not to follow the minimum wage laws.

1104
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:46,970
We are comfortable proceeding against
the company for violating our last,

1105
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,400
um,
and that we,

1106
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:52,590
we believe that there was some agreement
that so long as the country follows the

1107
01:10:52,591 --> 01:10:57,591
piece of law certainly does that she and
I have principals are respected and that

1108
01:10:59,491 --> 01:11:01,160
this is something that I think a lot of
parties agree to.

1109
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,710
A little bit of feedback on.

1110
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,320
Some of the ideas we've gone here and
then we're going to take a boat.

1111
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,060
Um,
so,

1112
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:20,950
uh,
first the DVCA style notes and take

1113
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:23,910
a.
So I thought,

1114
01:11:23,911 --> 01:11:24,670
let me just start.
Okay,

1115
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:29,190
go and think those are very creative
ideas and I will certainly take them

1116
01:11:29,191 --> 01:11:30,370
back towards you.
And I

1117
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:38,700
know
I'm going to take a little while to

1118
01:11:38,701 --> 01:11:43,701
process that.
The DNC was definitely interesting.

1119
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:46,870
I liked how you kinda came up with the
tradeoffs.

1120
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,590
You just sort of that benefit.
I'm not sure that the Vietnamese

1121
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:54,210
government is necessarily going to be
really thrilled with that and it's.

1122
01:11:54,211 --> 01:11:56,190
I mean,
I certainly love the idea of preserving

1123
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:57,660
anonymity,
but from what we've heard about the

1124
01:11:57,661 --> 01:11:59,760
Vietnamese government,
they may not necessarily.

1125
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:02,940
They may have other ways of knowing who
you are,

1126
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:06,270
so I'm not sure that you're really going
to preserve your referring to key

1127
01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:10,600
loggers and other trojans and this
precise.

1128
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:19,470
I'm trying to remember what the
Vietnamese isp situations,

1129
01:12:19,471 --> 01:12:22,580
but my recollection is that there's,
there's a pretty close tie to the

1130
01:12:22,581 --> 01:12:27,060
government in a lot of instances.
I'm not sure how they're gonna feel

1131
01:12:27,061 --> 01:12:30,720
about it,
but certainly it seems like a good start

1132
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:32,790
to see,
well if there is a problem and someone

1133
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:33,571
does say,
Hey,

1134
01:12:33,571 --> 01:12:36,290
I want to blow the whistle on this does
scale unlike some of these other

1135
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,940
solutions which I think are going to
have a real challenge with scaling.

1136
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,150
Um,
whether there's potential for abuse in

1137
01:12:41,151 --> 01:12:44,460
the DSCA style thing.
And certainly people have argued that

1138
01:12:44,461 --> 01:12:48,670
there have been abuses in the US of a,
on that front end therapy.

1139
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:53,760
Similarly in these context.
So what about international arbitration?

1140
01:12:54,221 --> 01:12:58,680
When Debbie came back,
there were some up.

1141
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:01,140
The trade issue is interesting and this
is certainly something that the

1142
01:13:01,141 --> 01:13:05,520
companies have pursued.
I don't know that anyone has really felt

1143
01:13:05,521 --> 01:13:08,850
that adding it into WTO,
maybe tim mover and paper that was

1144
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:13,920
advocated for epic adding into WTO,
but my suspicion is the scaling issue is

1145
01:13:15,421 --> 01:13:15,930
one problem.

1146
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:19,770
How does it work?
How does it work in practice when you

1147
01:13:19,771 --> 01:13:24,120
have a pretty substantial number of
actual replaces a possible,

1148
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:25,710
when you have a legitimate law
enforcement,

1149
01:13:25,711 --> 01:13:28,080
how do you determine the difference
between those two things?

1150
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,270
What does it mean?
I think you guys also had government

1151
01:13:30,271 --> 01:13:32,550
signing on the GSI.
I have no clue without looking in

1152
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:36,670
practice if a lot of it's about
responsible company behavior piece of

1153
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:39,510
it's interactions with governments
rather than responsible government

1154
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,070
behavior,
which it shouldn't be falling in some of

1155
01:13:42,071 --> 01:13:45,120
the US anyway,
that somebody or perhaps that universal

1156
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:46,710
declaration,
declaration of human rights to.

1157
01:13:46,711 --> 01:13:50,730
It's mostly,
I assume that I have to be quite frank.

1158
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,730
Um,
and uh,

1159
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:59,040
I think the value of women within Dni,
there is a venue for complaint.

1160
01:13:59,041 --> 01:14:03,870
There is a third party complaint
mechanism that we're working on right

1161
01:14:03,871 --> 01:14:08,790
now,
so I had a that needs to be some space,

1162
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:12,970
but I'm not convinced that the WTO,
which hasn't arguably been super kind to

1163
01:14:12,971 --> 01:14:14,690
some countries,
wouldn't really do the best place.

1164
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:21,040
I'm sure they do.
I

1165
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:29,650
is that Chinese book before the
International Telecommunications Union

1166
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:32,770
to retrofit the Internet so that all
communications are traceable.

1167
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:38,710
It's proceeding for studying from now
until 2012 for the Chinese herbalist.

1168
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:43,130
Very hard and ACB and finger in this
class as well.

1169
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:46,860
I mean,
so I guess to the rest of new attorneys

1170
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:51,640
may have this already involved in mind,
but I think what you would see as sort

1171
01:14:51,641 --> 01:14:54,550
of always seen with a lot of other
technologies that there would be scope

1172
01:14:54,551 --> 01:14:56,860
creep and uh,
what you might,

1173
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,390
when you start out with your filtering
or sensory activity,

1174
01:14:59,391 --> 01:15:03,760
you begin to filter out or filter or
search for child porn only.

1175
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,000
And then child porn moves into kind of
other objectional speech.

1176
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:07,661
Like,
I don't know,

1177
01:15:07,661 --> 01:15:10,550
the political opposition or different
ideas of religion.

1178
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:13,780
So forth.
And I think you could see very likely a

1179
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:16,330
scope creep with this.
I also wonder,

1180
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:18,370
I mean,
so that's the scary side.

1181
01:15:18,371 --> 01:15:23,371
The other side is I tend to be a juvie
excited the fold that any technology

1182
01:15:24,851 --> 01:15:28,480
fixed will remedy anything that there's
always going to be a technology fix.

1183
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,870
Um,
and uh,

1184
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:36,070
perhaps that identify you by your,
you're a very noble aims,

1185
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:40,090
but perhaps it's enough if you can make
people think that they can be traced

1186
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:41,273
that sufficient.

1187
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:47,010
Congress is committee that looks out for
every single piece of intervention.

1188
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:50,650
So that to me sounded sounded very
boastful.

1189
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:54,960
Like if my recollection of the bill is
accurate in

1190
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:59,020
that same,
he seems like it would be pretty

1191
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:04,021
difficult to practice.
My recollection is that piece and the

1192
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:06,990
international legal processes like this,
another defer to the lawyers in the room

1193
01:16:06,991 --> 01:16:11,991
and all of which
you and me is that you're looking at a

1194
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:17,530
few years currently to get many of these
sorts of questions resolved.

1195
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:22,710
So going from a few years to being able
to resolve the volume of questions,

1196
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:29,370
not just from Vietnam but from all the
other countries around the world would

1197
01:16:29,741 --> 01:16:33,030
seem like the presenting the real
challenge and I think Jonathan's

1198
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:38,130
questions as to what's the flip side of
this is real important that we could end

1199
01:16:40,361 --> 01:16:44,820
up in a similar situation
we have to eat on go

1200
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:52,240
what about a industry international
network of pro bono lawyers in secret

1201
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:55,840
ucl as well.
So there were definitely some fun

1202
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:57,510
elements of,
and Mystique

1203
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:00,600
is all about fun.

1204
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:07,210
Yeah.
Criticism and it didn't seem there was a

1205
01:17:07,211 --> 01:17:11,210
lot of stick
which we would expect,

1206
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:15,790
but I liked it.
I thought the Yahoo alerting blogs.

1207
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:17,360
Interesting.
I mean,

1208
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:21,770
I think it depends on the jurisdiction,
but most places I think it's generally

1209
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,690
illegal and you guys got to get it
corrected.

1210
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:29,210
If I'm wrong to alert someone that law
enforcement has requested their,

1211
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,070
uh,
information,

1212
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:33,840
unless it's for a civil procedure in
which some cases.

1213
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:39,770
So my suspicion is that that's probably
depending on whose laws to follow that

1214
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:42,960
could present some problems for them.
Um,

1215
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,080
but,
uh,

1216
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,740
I,
I like that as a way of saying is there

1217
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:50,120
some way that we can work and try to
remedy this situation internally?

1218
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:54,350
The lobbying government doesn't
necessarily strike me as something

1219
01:17:54,351 --> 01:17:58,610
that's gonna go too far since that's
already happening right now,

1220
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:02,540
but perhaps it might institute some
change,

1221
01:18:02,730 --> 01:18:05,360
um,
ended up Bono provolone or whereas is

1222
01:18:05,361 --> 01:18:07,580
interesting.
I think it would be pretty neat if you

1223
01:18:07,581 --> 01:18:11,750
could get lawyers to sign on to do that.
But of course what we've seen in a good

1224
01:18:11,751 --> 01:18:14,030
number of countries is reprisals against
those lawyers.

1225
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:19,330
And this is often a lot of settings
which we want our jurisdiction.

1226
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:30,290
I'm sure you do.

1227
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,260
But I also do think,
I don't think you want them to their

1228
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:36,520
option.
I don't think you want.

1229
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,040
I think that within your government
there are a lot of different factions

1230
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:43,250
and some,
maybe I'm more dug in on this sort of

1231
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:48,251
control and others in fact may be open
to a more progressive approach and might

1232
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:50,810
find it.
And I suspect that this is always the

1233
01:18:50,811 --> 01:18:52,670
case.
We'd like to talk about governance is

1234
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:56,510
monolithic,
but that in fact there's more variety or

1235
01:18:56,540 --> 01:19:01,540
more diversity of views in the
government that if the these companies

1236
01:19:02,031 --> 01:19:05,780
were to lose or there were to be or to
leave or if there were to be a large

1237
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:09,530
international dispute that it would cost
you some and certainly your relationship

1238
01:19:09,531 --> 01:19:10,940
with the US.
Well,

1239
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:14,110
I supposed to.
China is significant in terms of the

1240
01:19:14,111 --> 01:19:18,280
economic terms and I don't think while
you don't necessarily want to bend over

1241
01:19:18,281 --> 01:19:20,610
backwards to please the Congress,
um,

1242
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:24,560
you at the same time,
we're probably not eager to,

1243
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:26,990
um,
to cause some major international

1244
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:32,320
so they wouldn't take a vote.
Executive catching over my two minutes

1245
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:35,270
already.
I'm thinking perhaps take a boat over

1246
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:38,930
the class.
Any of your feedback on hold you here

1247
01:19:38,931 --> 01:19:41,900
any longer than we actually happen.
So thank you very much for

1248
01:19:41,901 --> 01:19:42,800
participating.

1249
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:50,290
Thank you.
