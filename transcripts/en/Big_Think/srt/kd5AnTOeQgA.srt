1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,980
I think the media today is the temple
mess.

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,780
I mean,
it's all sound bytes.

3
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:14,570
It's all sex.
It's all confrontation.

4
00:00:14,571 --> 00:00:18,690
It's all absurd.
Phony reality shows high.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,360
It's very hard to have an intelligent
discourse that loss any amount of time

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,430
where someone can actually ask
questions,

7
00:00:25,431 --> 00:00:27,530
you can answer them,
they can ask a followup question,

8
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:30,890
you can answer.
You can actually get the brain opening

9
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:35,420
and closing and moving around and
digesting this material and dwelling on

10
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:36,254
it.
It's all,

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,600
what can you say?
And five words,

12
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:40,430
you know,
how can you sum this up?

13
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,820
So at Peta,
we have become gimmicky.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,090
We have become sex obsessed ourselves.
You know,

15
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:50,360
we use naked women.
We use scantily close people.

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,900
Um,
we do whatever we need to do to take

17
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:58,901
this serious message and try to get it
into the media mind.

18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,990
And that's very,
very hard these days because the old

19
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:04,290
days of the serious

20
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,250
debate.
