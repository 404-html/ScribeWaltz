1
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,840
I think if we raise our standards,
our urban schools,

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,740
and if we can possibly attract a better,
more qualified pool of teachers down the

3
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:22,151
road,
we can do fantastic things in inner city

4
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:24,440
schools.
In our school,

5
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:29,441
University Academy for example,
we pay performance pay,

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,170
in other words,
in addition to a teacher's salary.

7
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,030
We have an incentive for a teacher to do
well in the classroom.

8
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,200
And so we attract a slightly different
type of teacher.

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,410
One Who is motivated to do well and um,
and I think it's an important when you

10
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:53,270
look at other service businesses and not
only in the United States but around the

11
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:56,330
world,
it's common for managers to get

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,690
incentives,
financial incentives to do a good job.

13
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,350
But we've never really done much of that
in the area of education,

14
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:08,351
which really is a service business.
And I think if we can pay teachers

15
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,410
competitively and attract and retain
them,

16
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,130
we can do great things in this gun.
