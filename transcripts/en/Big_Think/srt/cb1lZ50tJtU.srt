1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,270
Well I think you can really trace it
back to at least the 1960s,

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,990
if not earlier.
What we started to see going on in

3
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:16,770
American politics in the 1960s and
continuing into the seventies and

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,030
eighties was really the disintegration
of the old new deal coalition,

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,130
uh,
and alignment that had been,

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,850
uh,
kind of put together by Franklin

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,080
Roosevelt and that sustained the
Democratic Party as the dominant party

8
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,480
in American politics for many years.
Uh,

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,420
that coalition consisted of a number of
groups,

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,420
uh,
such as white southerners,

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,600
a northern white ethnic voters and white
working class voters,

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,460
um,
that,

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,260
um,
inherently had a little in common with

14
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:52,800
each other,
particularly when you add in,

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,370
um,
the growing representation of African

16
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,430
American voters after the 1960s with the
voting rights act.

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,980
Um,
so this coalition was sort of inherently

18
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:06,210
unstable.
And what we began to see in the 1960s,

19
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:09,060
uh,
especially after the passage of the

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,240
voting rights act and the growth of the
African American electorate was that,

21
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,410
um,
the more conservative elements in that

22
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:21,240
coalition,
particularly white southerners,

23
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:22,540
but also,
um,

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,800
conservative white ethnic voters began
to move,

25
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,290
uh,
towards the Republicans.

26
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,500
Uh,
we had an ideological realignment that

27
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:33,550
began,
it didn't happen overnight.

28
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,540
It was a,
it was not something that occurred in a

29
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,190
single election or a couple of
elections.

30
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:41,190
It was something that took place over
several decades actually.

31
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,150
Uh,
but we gradually began to see these more

32
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:49,350
conservative voters moving away from the
Democrats and into the Republican camp.

33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,700
Uh,
and on the other hand,

34
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:52,900
in response to that,
um,

35
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,900
more moderate to liberal voters,
uh,

36
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,990
who had been aligned with the
Republicans,

37
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:02,670
especially in parts of the country where
you had a moderate to liberal

38
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:05,130
republicans like the northeast,
um,

39
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,200
they began to move away from the
Republicans and toward the Democrats as

40
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:12,450
the Republican party became increasingly
conservative.

41
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:16,320
So you can see this beginning with
Richard Nixon's southern strategy,

42
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,150
uh,
in 1972,

43
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,600
uh,
and continuing with Ronald Reagan's

44
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,130
presidential campaigns.
And then certainly in the 1990s with,

45
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,330
uh,
the,

46
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,540
uh,
takeover of the Republican Party in

47
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:34,710
Congress by a more conservative group of
leaders led by Newt Gingrich.

48
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,820
So essentially what was happening here
was that,

49
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,650
uh,
at the elite level,

50
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,860
we were seeing increasing ideological
polarization and that change began to,

51
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,640
uh,
affect the loyalties of the voters,

52
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,070
uh,
and increasingly over time.

53
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,790
And by the time we got to the 1990s,
uh,

54
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,970
it had reached the point where,
um,

55
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,550
the,
uh,

56
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,460
old democratic coalition,
uh,

57
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,600
and the Democratic dominance of at least
congress was no longer no longer

58
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,040
existed.
Uh,

59
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,490
and it's really continued even,
uh,

60
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,310
up to the present time.
Uh,

61
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,600
now something else that's been happening
a over this entire time period,

62
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:23,800
and especially with the last couple of
decades,

63
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,900
it's also playing into this has been,
uh,

64
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,950
the demographic changes taking place in
the electorate and the growing diversity

65
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,490
of the American Electric,
uh,

66
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:39,710
were nonwhite voters are becoming a
larger and larger share of the

67
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,310
electorate.
Uh,

68
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,170
and particularly of the Democratic
Coalition,

69
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:49,171
so that by 2008,
when you look at the contributions of

70
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,170
different racial and ethnic groups to
the,

71
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:54,250
uh,
party coalitions,

72
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:55,900
you see that,
um,

73
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,980
nonwhites made up over 40% of democratic
voters.

74
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,010
Um,
whereas,

75
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,820
um,
non whites were only about seven or 8%

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,460
of Republican voters,
you know,

77
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:11,830
so this is growing divergence between
the parties,

78
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,340
both in terms of their racial and
ethnic,

79
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,060
uh,
groups that support the parties.

80
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:22,570
And also in terms of ideology and
issues,

81
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,690
it's the more engaged segment of the
public that really becomes increasingly

82
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:36,691
polarized because they're the ones who
are really following these debates,

83
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:41,050
who are really attentive to what is
going on in the congress to the

84
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:43,990
positions of the parties.
And so they tend to react,

85
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,650
uh,
much more quickly than people who are

86
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:48,550
just not,
you know,

87
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:51,790
not paying attention.
But what happens over time is that even

88
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,900
though this process of realignment
really was,

89
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,720
I think,
initiated by political elites,

90
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,760
um,
for strategic reasons.

91
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:05,080
So you had Republican politicians in
particular who I think saw opportunities

92
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:09,910
to win over some of these voting groups
that had been traditionally supporting

93
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:10,750
the Democrats.

94
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,020
Um,
but once the public,

95
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,680
or at least the attentive segment of the
public becomes polarized,

96
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,870
that in turn sort of starts to constrain
the positions of political elites

97
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:24,180
themselves.
Uh,

98
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:29,350
and now they have to reflect the views
of the voters who make up their,

99
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,090
uh,
their own base.

100
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:36,510
And so what we're seeing today is that
it's gotten to the point where the party

101
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:42,541
leaders and candidates for office are
really kind of constrained to a large

102
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:47,551
degree by the polarization that exists
among the attentive public.

103
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,550
So if you look,
for example,

104
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:50,170
at primary voters,
you find that,

105
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,050
you know,
Republican primary voters are really

106
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:55,810
quite conservative.
By and large Democratic primary voters

107
00:05:55,811 --> 00:06:00,811
tend to be a fairly liberal and
therefore candidates who want to be

108
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:07,130
successful in politics,
you have to appeal to these primary

109
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:09,020
voters.
In addition,

110
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,530
um,
there are more and more congressional

111
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:17,531
districts and even states where one
party is dominant and therefore the key

112
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:23,441
to success in those types of districts.
And those types of states is again,

113
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:28,550
just to appeal to the party base and
there's less need to worry about

114
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:30,290
appealing to voters,
uh,

115
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,220
from the other party.
So political campaigns have become more

116
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:39,221
about mobilizing the base then about
appealing to the swing voters in the

117
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:41,924
middle.

118
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,150
If you look back over the course of
American history,

119
00:06:48,151 --> 00:06:50,340
we've been through many periods of
polarization,

120
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,720
uh,
to some extent.

121
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:53,170
I think,
um,

122
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,940
the period from the 1950s do the 1960s
was unusual in that a degree of partisan

123
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:04,410
polarization was much less than normal.
Um,

124
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,440
but if you go back and look at American
politics in the 19th century,

125
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,010
uh,
and in much of the early 20th century,

126
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:13,140
you find that in fact,
you know,

127
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:17,760
they were very sharp differences between
the parties and very intense conflict

128
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,820
and very overheated rhetoric,
uh,

129
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,450
and really nasty personal attacks,
uh,

130
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:29,451
on even some of the leaders that we've
come to think of as among our greatest,

131
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,881
you know,
presidents,

132
00:07:32,881 --> 00:07:37,800
people like Thomas Jefferson and Abraham
Lincoln were viciously attacked.

133
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,850
Uh,
um,

134
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,920
Franklin Roosevelt certainly was as
well.

135
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:41,960
So,
um,

136
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,880
in a way this is just sort of normal
politics.

137
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,940
It's really interesting to go back and
of course they didn't have the internet

138
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,740
or cable news or talk radio,
but what they had were pamphlets and a

139
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,880
party newspapers.
And,

140
00:07:57,881 --> 00:07:59,500
um,
if you go back and look at some of those

141
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:00,850
things,
you know,

142
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:01,990
um,
as I said,

143
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:04,840
the,
the attacks were very personal,

144
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,060
very nasty.
Uh,

145
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:11,590
I mean much worse than anything we've
seen in recent election campaigns.

146
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,491
Oh,
definitely.

147
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:21,080
I mean,
I think that the changes that have

148
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:23,360
occurred in,
uh,

149
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,403
the,
uh,

150
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:29,090
in the media have a reinforced this
trend toward polarization,

151
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,170
particularly the proliferation of news
outlets,

152
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,100
uh,
cable news talk radio and the Internet,

153
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,950
which mean that now people have many
more choices about where to get their

154
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:47,951
political information and they can turn
to a news outlets and information

155
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,170
sources that are,
uh,

156
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,480
you know,
in consistent,

157
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,100
uh,
or reflect their own,

158
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,150
you know,
their own political orientation.

159
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:59,280
So if you're,
whether you're liberal or Conservative,

160
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,530
you can find,
you know,

161
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,870
media outlets.
You can go to Fox News.

162
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:06,060
If you're a conservative,
you can go to MSNBC.

163
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:08,130
If you're liberal.
Uh,

164
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,030
and,
uh,

165
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,900
people no longer rely on,
you know,

166
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:16,470
a few major network news broadcasts,
um,

167
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,510
to get their information the way they
did,

168
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,460
you know,
40 or 50 years ago.

169
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,920
Well,
I think the problem there is not so much

170
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:32,970
with polarization as it is with certain
institutions and rules that have

171
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:36,270
survived from an earlier era when
politics was not so polarized.

172
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,270
Uh,
the prime example of that being the

173
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:41,430
filibuster in the Senate,
um,

174
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,760
because in the past when there's less
polarization,

175
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,110
the filibuster was used very sparingly.
As the parties have become increasingly

176
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:56,670
polarized,
we've seen that filibusters have become

177
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,360
routine and almost everything gets
filibustered because it is,

178
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,130
you know,
the only way that the minority party can

179
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,270
exert any influence.
Um,

180
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,840
so I think it is that filibuster role.
They fact that it takes only 41 senators

181
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:23,280
to effectively block,
uh,

182
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:28,281
any action on the part of the majority
that is largely responsible for this

183
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,470
sense,
uh,

184
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:30,901
of,
uh,

185
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:31,734
of,
um,

186
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:32,911
uh,
you know,

187
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:34,590
of gridlock.
This feeling that,

188
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:38,400
that we've been gridlock.
And the reality is that this congress is

189
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:40,290
actually passed a lot of major
legislation.

190
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,180
Some of it's been quite controversial,
but,

191
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,760
uh,
it's not really the case that it's been

192
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:48,090
an unproductive congress.
It's just been involved in dealing with

193
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:51,240
some very controversial issues.
Um,

194
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,400
and on the house side where majority
rule really prevails,

195
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,860
uh,
a great deal of legislation has been

196
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:01,530
passed.
Some of it has then gotten bogged down

197
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:03,160
in the Senate.
Um,

198
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,730
and still,
uh,

199
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,840
it's still awaiting action again because
of the filibuster rule primarily.

200
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,601
Well,
I,

201
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:20,040
you know,
I like to say that,

202
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,310
uh,
we need a certain degree of polarization

203
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:25,930
that democracy really depends upon,
uh,

204
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,620
having,
uh,

205
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,330
a certain degree of polarization,
uh,

206
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,360
so that voters can choose between the
parties based on which set of policies

207
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:41,280
you really support.
And I think today it's pretty clear.

208
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:44,970
I think what the parties stand for.
People for the most part,

209
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,940
I think understand the differences
between the democratic and Republican

210
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,070
parties.
Uh,

211
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,260
and they feel that,
um,

212
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,560
there's a lot at stake in these
elections and therefore that tends to,

213
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,760
uh,
increase the level of interest.

214
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,510
Certainly polarization can go too far.
And,

215
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,500
uh,
you know,

216
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,890
in a democratic political system,
it's important that those who,

217
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,360
uh,
are defeated,

218
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,840
uh,
have to recognize and accept the

219
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:21,430
legitimacy of the winners.
And the winners have to,

220
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,800
uh,
understand that,

221
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,300
you know,
those who lost the last election may be

222
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,800
back in power in the future.

223
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,860
Uh,
and what we're seeing now in American

224
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:37,330
politics is that sometimes the,
the rhetoric I think gets so heated,

225
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,550
uh,
that,

226
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,260
um,
you know,

227
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:46,410
there's a tendency to sometimes
questioned the legitimacy of the other

228
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:48,640
side.
Um,

229
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,850
and we've seen this a on both sides that
both among Democrats and Republicans as

230
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:57,220
a tendency to question the legitimacy of
the,

231
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:58,360
uh,
of the other party.

232
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,450
And the other side to question the,
um,

233
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,380
the loyalty of the other side,
the patriotism of the other side.

234
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,660
Um,
you know,

235
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,550
uh,
so,

236
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,760
uh,
that kind of inflamed rhetoric can

237
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,340
sometimes also lead to threats of
violence,

238
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,550
you know,
and I think that is a very unfortunate.

239
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:24,390
Um,
so I think while having a clear

240
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:27,100
differences between the parties is a
good thing.

241
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,160
Uh,
I think that some of the overheated

242
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:31,990
rhetoric,
uh,

243
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,160
and personal animosity that we've seen
in recent years,

244
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,740
uh,
is really not a desirable,

245
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,550
well I don't think it's polarization is
going to end anytime soon.

246
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,490
Uh,
I think that there are some very

247
00:13:50,491 --> 00:13:53,370
important longterm factors underlying
it.

248
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,840
One of which is the growing in a racial
and ethnic diversity of the,

249
00:13:57,841 --> 00:13:58,740
uh,
electorate,

250
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:01,140
which is only going to increase.
Uh,

251
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:06,141
and so as the
racial and ethnic composition of the

252
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:09,900
party coalitions continues to divert,
um,

253
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,320
I think that that is kind of reinforcing
this trend toward polarization.

254
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,240
We're seeing that on the issue of
immigration for example,

255
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,060
where,
um,

256
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,980
you know,
on the one hand,

257
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:24,410
I think that,
um,

258
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,190
there are some Republican party leaders
and strategists who realized that that

259
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,370
the party really needs to figure out a
way to reach out to this rapidly growing

260
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,700
voting block of,
you know,

261
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,140
Latinos,
uh,

262
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,540
who are now the largest ethnic group,
uh,

263
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,700
largest minority in the country and
within a few years will be the largest

264
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,060
minority in the electorate.
Um,

265
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,780
and you know,
we'll continue to make up a growing

266
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:55,310
share of the population.

267
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,460
And the electrode over time.
Uh,

268
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,710
but on the other hand,
there's a great deal of pressure from

269
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:05,711
the conservative Republican base to take
a hard line stance on issues like

270
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:07,820
immigration.
Um,

271
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,410
so I think,
um,

272
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,880
demographic trends,
um,

273
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,940
are contributing to this polarization.
I think rising education levels are

274
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:20,060
contributing to it.
We have a better educated electorate,

275
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:25,061
which also means a larger percentage of
voters who tend to think about politics

276
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:29,400
in ideological terms,
um,

277
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,480
who can understand these ideological
debates.

278
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,423
And,
uh,

279
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,730
so all that I think is suggest that this
is a,

280
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,280
this is likely to continue for some
time.

281
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,990
Uh,
now eventually,

282
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,920
um,
we may see the leaders of one party or

283
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:50,630
the other decide that it is in their
interest to try to move back toward the

284
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:52,700
center.
Um,

285
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,260
particularly if that party feels that
that is the only way to survive.

286
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,580
Um,
we saw that recently in,

287
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:02,360
in Britain where,
you know,

288
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:06,620
the Conservative Party after being out
in the wilderness for 13 years,

289
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,960
uh,
found a new leader who decided that it

290
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:14,930
was necessary to moderate the parties
image.

291
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,600
Um,
so that could happen at some point,

292
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,740
but it's difficult in our system because
in our system,

293
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:23,750
unlike Britain,
um,

294
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,780
the voters themselves plays such a key
role in selecting the leaders of the

295
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,900
party through the primary elections.
You don't really have,

296
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,350
uh,
something analogous to that in Britain

297
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,850
or in most,
most other countries.

298
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,720
Um,
so leaders aren't necessarily free here

299
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,610
to just,
uh,

300
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,820
adopt new positions,
you know,

301
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:47,950
Willy Nilly.
Um,

302
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,690
they have to worry about how the voters
who make up their base,

303
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:53,630
they're going to respond.
So I think that God is going to act as

304
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:56,720
a,
a pretty strong break on any tendency

305
00:16:56,721 --> 00:17:00,920
toward a moderation in the foreseeable
future.

306
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,420
I think it may lead to some changes in
the larger political system,

307
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,720
particularly in some of the rules and
procedures in the Congress and

308
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:20,840
especially in the Senate.
The most likely source of change are

309
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,600
place where I think we're likely to see
change will be there.

310
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,990
Because I see the Senate right now as
being a particularly an obstacle,

311
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,800
um,
to,

312
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,530
uh,
you know,

313
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,970
to majority rule,
um,

314
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
both because of the filibuster but also
because of the basis of representation

315
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:43,700
there that every state has two senators,
which means that,

316
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,110
um,
states with a 500,000 people like

317
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:52,950
Wyoming have two senators and states
with 37 million people like California

318
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:54,780
has two senators.
Um,

319
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,950
the 20 least populous states have less
people in them than California alone.

320
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,240
So,
uh,

321
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,820
that is,
uh,

322
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,430
I think,
uh,

323
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,550
uh,
surprises a lot of people,

324
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,620
you know,
we're sort of aware that,

325
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,810
you know,
states have different populations,

326
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:21,090
but that divergence just keeps
increasing,

327
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,770
you know,
and,

328
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:24,240
uh,
so I think there's going to be some

329
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:26,050
pressure there,
um,

330
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,080
to,
uh,

331
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,080
at least reform some of the rules of the
Senate,

332
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:36,081
like the filibuster rule to make it at
least somewhat easier for the majority

333
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,890
to govern because right now,
um,

334
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,650
because of the filibuster,
because you need a superman,

335
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:47,850
especially after the midterm elections
where the number of Democrats in the

336
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:49,530
Senate is almost certain to be reduced.

337
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,870
Um,
so we're going to go back to having a

338
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:54,210
much smaller majority,
um,

339
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,700
you know,
the likelihood of getting 60 votes to

340
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:02,930
pass anything is going to be,
you know,

341
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,803
almost no.

342
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,341
Well,
you know,

343
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:16,170
you hear about a ever to hear you hear a
rhetoric along those lines quite

344
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:17,820
frequently.
When,

345
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,700
um,
President Obama was,

346
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,990
um,
of course,

347
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,390
his first,
uh,

348
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,020
real,
uh,

349
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,080
uh,
breakthrough,

350
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,990
uh,
was the speech that he gave at the,

351
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:34,650
uh,
as the 2004 Democratic National

352
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,130
Convention where,
you know,

353
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,320
he talked about there being,
you know,

354
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,700
there's no,
you know,

355
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,340
red,
there's no there in a red states of

356
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:47,310
American blue states of America.
There's one United States of America.

357
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,541
And then,
you know,

358
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:52,410
he used some similar rhetoric during the
2008 presidential campaign.

359
00:19:52,411 --> 00:19:54,070
And John Mccain also,
you know,

360
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:58,050
talked about wanting to heal these rifts
and,

361
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,010
uh,
appealing to those on the other side.

362
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:02,580
But,
you know,

363
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,620
as the campaign went on,
we saw that,

364
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,060
uh,
actually the,

365
00:20:06,061 --> 00:20:07,140
uh,
uh,

366
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,840
the,
the positions of the candidates became

367
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,920
increasingly polarized.
Uh,

368
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,440
and by the end there,
you know,

369
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:18,360
there was very little of that sort of an
effort to reach across the,

370
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:19,560
uh,
to the other side.

371
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,990
Um,
because the fact is that,

372
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,200
you know,
the electrode itself is very polarized.

373
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,870
And so,
you know,

374
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,600
we have,
uh,

375
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,110
uh,
a very high degree of,

376
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,800
uh,
you know,

377
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,550
partisanship.
Uh,

378
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,840
and when it comes to voting,
people tend to vote along party lines.

379
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:42,390
There's not much crossover voting these
days.

380
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,540
Uh,
and so as the campaign proceeds,

381
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,080
they focus tends to become increasingly
on energizing and mobilizing your own

382
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:52,470
base.
Okay.

383
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:53,520
You know,
b,

384
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,520
because there's such a small sliver of
undecided voters left,

385
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,420
uh,
in,

386
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,880
in the middle,
and it's actually very hard to act even

387
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:04,220
reached those people,
you know,

388
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,500
because they tend to actually be the
least least interested in at least

389
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:09,810
attentive segment of the,
of the public.

390
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,190
So,
and since the election,

391
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:13,740
certainly we've seen more of that sort
of back and forth,

392
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,993
you know,
about,

393
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,600
um,
why can't we have more bipartisanship

394
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,380
and each side blaming the other for,
you know,

395
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,060
the lack of bipartisanship.

396
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,940
But fundamentally,
I think it's very difficult to have any

397
00:21:26,941 --> 00:21:30,960
kind of bipartisan cooperation these
days because the differences between the

398
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:32,790
parties are so great.
Um,

399
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,930
there used to be a lot of members of
Congress in the middle.

400
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,810
You had moderate to conservative
Democrats,

401
00:21:39,811 --> 00:21:43,260
you had moderate to liberal Republicans,
there was a lot of overlap there.

402
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:47,700
And therefore it was easy to find
coalition partners from the other party.

403
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,910
Now there's no overlap at all between
the parties.

404
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,650
And so to build a bipartisan coalition
is very difficult because you have to,

405
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,350
when you,
when you tried to reach across the,

406
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:00,270
uh,
the partisan divide,

407
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:01,710
that divide is very,
very wide.

408
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,900
Uh,
and it means that,

409
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,960
um,
to bring in any significant number of

410
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,120
members from the other party,
you have to actually compromise your

411
00:22:16,221 --> 00:22:18,190
fundamental principles.
Uh,

412
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,360
and that's why I think we're seeing that
that just doesn't happen.

413
00:22:20,361 --> 00:22:22,220
There are a handful of members in the
middle.

414
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,960
Um,
and so,

415
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,900
you know,
you'll see some efforts to reach out to

416
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:31,901
those few members as we saw in the early
days of the Obama administration when

417
00:22:33,021 --> 00:22:37,700
they were able to win over,
they had three Republican senators who

418
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:41,240
voted for the stimulus bill and one of
them subsequently switched parties.

419
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,990
Well,
I think this person does exist,

420
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:51,350
but it's really confined primarily to
the opposition party,

421
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,690
to the supporters of the opposition
party.

422
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,030
Um,
and we saw the same thing really,

423
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,400
um,
during the Bush administration,

424
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,640
particularly the last two years of the
Bush administration.

425
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,190
There were a lot of angry voters out
there,

426
00:23:04,191 --> 00:23:05,420
but the,
at that time they were,

427
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,220
they were almost all democrats who were
upset about things like the war in Iraq,

428
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,660
uh,
about,

429
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,400
um,
the Bush administration's,

430
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:15,440
you know,
economic and environmental policies and

431
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:18,740
so on.
Now with a Democratic president and

432
00:23:18,741 --> 00:23:21,080
Congress,
it's the Republicans,

433
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,990
especially the more engaged Republicans
who are angry,

434
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,630
they are angry because they disagree,
you know,

435
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,680
with the Democrats on issues like
healthcare,

436
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,580
uh,
and budgetary priorities and so on.

437
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,841
So,
yes,

438
00:23:35,841 --> 00:23:37,790
I mean,
I think there are angry voters out

439
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,140
there.
I think sometimes it gets a little

440
00:23:39,141 --> 00:23:40,730
overblown,
you know,

441
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:45,731
because I'm not sure that
voters are angry or overall now than

442
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:49,220
they have been in the past.
Um,

443
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,330
I think it's just that we're seeing more
visible manifestations of that with

444
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,830
these tea party demonstrations.

445
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,770
Well,
they're not angry anymore because now,

446
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,160
uh,
for the most part,

447
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,190
because you have a democratic president,
um,

448
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,670
now the,
um,

449
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,240
some of them might still not be thrilled
with all of the things the Obama

450
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,120
administration has done.
But by and large,

451
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,250
I think what you find is that there's
been a reversal,

452
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,391
you know,
that,

453
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:18,350
uh,
you know,

454
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,770
sort of like the,
the anger is gone over from one side to

455
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:26,771
the other.
Not Right now,

456
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,780
you know,
because again,

457
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:33,560
it's harder I think for people to get
worked up when,

458
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,030
you know,
they're in the majority,

459
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,030
um,
that especially in midterm elections,

460
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:41,810
we tend to see that it's the disgruntled
people who are the most active.

461
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:47,170
We saw that in 2006 where it was really
the Democrats by and large,

462
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:51,080
who are the most enthusiastic at the
most engaged.

463
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,290
Um,
and now it's the Republicans,

464
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,940
you know,
with a Democrat in the White House.

465
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:58,700
Uh,
so that's sort of part of the normal

466
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:02,000
cycle of American politics.
That's what tends to happen in these,

467
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,730
in these midterm elections.
It's just that with increasing

468
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:06,140
polarization,
you know,

469
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,320
I think what happens now is that these
swings become greater,

470
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,760
um,
and the reaction becomes even stronger.

471
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,730
Well,
I think certainly a,

472
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,530
a,
some incumbents are in danger,

473
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:27,620
although I think that some of the,
um,

474
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,720
media,
uh,

475
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,570
characterization of the election,
uh,

476
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,110
as an anti incumbent wave has been
overblown.

477
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,860
Uh,
the fact is that in all of these primary

478
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:42,740
elections so far,
only one house incumbent has actually

479
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:43,880
been defeated.
One,

480
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,730
um,
and two Senate incumbents.

481
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,150
But in both of those cases,
I think there were actually special

482
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,070
reasons behind their losses.
I mean,

483
00:25:52,071 --> 00:25:57,071
Arlen Specter switched parties about a
year before the election and really gave

484
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,760
Democrats very little reason to vote for
him.

485
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,690
Here's a guy who had been a republican,
all of his career Democrats in

486
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:08,480
Pennsylvania.
We're used to voting against him.

487
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,940
Um,
he switched parties and basically the

488
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,590
rationale,
he gives us that,

489
00:26:12,591 --> 00:26:14,180
well,
I needed to do this to survive.

490
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,770
Um,
so,

491
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,980
you know,
I think there that it had more to do

492
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:19,814
with,
uh,

493
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:24,230
the particular circumstances of the
party switching by Arlen Specter.

494
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,090
Um,
and,

495
00:26:26,091 --> 00:26:27,880
um,
you know,

496
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,330
then,
uh,

497
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,121
in the,
the,

498
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,280
the Utah case,
you know,

499
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:32,240
you had a,
a,

500
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:35,030
not a primary election,
but a very small,

501
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,143
uh,
uh,

502
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:41,210
party convention dominated by the most
conservative activists in the Republican

503
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,140
Party in Utah,
which is a pretty conservative state to

504
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:46,230
begin with.
So I just wouldn't want to read too much

505
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,390
into that.
Um,

506
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,240
now there's no question when,
uh,

507
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:55,590
voters are discontented,
um,

508
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:00,620
over the economy and the state of the
country that they tend to vote against

509
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,550
the party in power.
And so,

510
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,900
and in addition to the fact that it's a
midterm election and the president's

511
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:11,490
party almost always,
you know,

512
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:16,530
loses seats in midterm elections and the
Democrats are in a rather defensive

513
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:22,080
posture anyway because they've picked up
so many seats in the last two elections,

514
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:24,900
many of which are actually in Republican
territory.

515
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,540
You know,
so you've got a lot of,

516
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,510
uh,
democratic incumbents running this year

517
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,450
who are representing states and
districts that,

518
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,380
that,
you know,

519
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:36,660
have usually voted Republican in the
past.

520
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,710
Um,
so my expectation is that the Democrats

521
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:43,530
will lose a substantial number of seats.
And,

522
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,640
and so,
you know,

523
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,430
quite a few democratic incumbents will
lose,

524
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:52,431
but that's more a reflection of just the
normal kind of partisan swings that we

525
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:56,340
see in elections and especially in
midterm elections rather than any

526
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,630
unusual level of voter anger.
And Moreover,

527
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,000
I think it's very,
um,

528
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,770
misleading,
I think to try to read too much into the

529
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,090
results of these primary elections or
special elections that have been taking

530
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:12,924
place.
Uh,

531
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,120
you know,
I think that is a tendency on the part

532
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:18,380
of the media often to over-interpret,
you know,

533
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,700
the latest event,
uh,

534
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,910
whatever just happened is always the
most important thing that's ever

535
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,190
happened.
We saw this during the presidential

536
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:26,851
campaign,
you know,

537
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:29,550
both the primaries and the general
election campaign.

538
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,770
Um,
Reverend Wright,

539
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,790
you know,
was when that,

540
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,850
when that event happened,
all that was the end of Obama's

541
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:36,330
candidacy.

542
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,163
Well,
it wasn't,

543
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,430
uh,
and again,

544
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:40,350
you know,
during the general election campaign,

545
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,690
uh,
all the furor over surrounding the,

546
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:45,210
uh,
choice of Sarah Palin as John Mccain's

547
00:28:45,211 --> 00:28:46,170
running mate,
well,

548
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:48,210
that turned out to be overblown,
you know,

549
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:50,490
so I think we're seeing the same thing
this year.

550
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,490
Uh,
every time some new interesting event

551
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:55,710
takes place,
whether it's an encumbent losing in a

552
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:56,930
primary,
you know,

553
00:28:56,931 --> 00:29:00,700
or a special election outcome.
The media jump on that and,

554
00:29:00,701 --> 00:29:02,440
and try to read,
you know,

555
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:06,450
into that some great significance for
what's going to happen in November.

556
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,280
Um,
I think that that is a really overblown.
