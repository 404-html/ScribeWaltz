1
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,830
Barry's a country was opened in 19
million population in a country with a

2
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,290
long history,
very rich culture,

3
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,070
and unfortunately some of the production
practices and enormous affect women and

4
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:29,781
negatively in the practice of Lfr,
which is a abducting girls for marriage,

5
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,250
is one of the harmful practices that
affect other physical and mental,

6
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,390
uh,
as with less social economic lives of

7
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,950
women in Ethiopia.

8
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,020
Mm,
okay.

9
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,930
I heard about the story on the radio.
Uh,

10
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,921
uh,
I was,

11
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:50,520
I was in a car with a driver and we were
listening to radio and,

12
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:51,710
uh,
the,

13
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,220
the,
there was a media coverage about 14

14
00:01:56,221 --> 00:02:01,221
years old girls being abducted and raped
and killing her would be husband.

15
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,250
So as soon as I,
um,

16
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,250
learned about story,
I immediately thought that we should be

17
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,790
going to this place which is 300
kilometers outside our discipline,

18
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,600
our where we work and we should be able
to defend the code.

19
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,070
I thought about this because,
uh,

20
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,420
I believe that,
uh,

21
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,700
we should save her life because she was
a facing like a life sentence.

22
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,560
And secondly,
also,

23
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:39,561
I knew that this is going to be a big
case precedent setting case,

24
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,770
which we'll see we could use for public
education to,

25
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,820
uh,
you know,

26
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,980
it has the dialogue and the conversation
around,

27
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,110
um,
abduction around that

28
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,920
onto and asked you kind of got him
uncle.

29
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,740
For some people,
especially people living in the West is

30
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,030
completely outside their experience.
Uh,

31
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,480
in that sense,
it's really educate,

32
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,910
educate people or uh,
you know,

33
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,870
uh,
how women live in the other part of the

34
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:12,750
world lit.
Secondly,

35
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:15,270
it's also a call to action.
Uh,

36
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:16,910
I believe,
um,

37
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,340
education been a women's rights
organizations and,

38
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:23,410
uh,
um,

39
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,420
government and then government and
institutions whose mandate focus on

40
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,760
gender equality,
uh,

41
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:35,761
would like to use this field to,
for advocacy for a ligand reform and to

42
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,630
sort of enhance and accelerate,
um,

43
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,940
uh,
programs,

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,811
uh,
towards,

45
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:47,820
uh,
especially,

46
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:48,800
uh,
uh,

47
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,640
fighting child marriage around the
world.

48
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:55,990
Like that's my hope.
Getting Angelina Jolie was quite

49
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,280
helpful.
The movie,

50
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:59,710
the content history,
uh,

51
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:04,711
the presentation is fantastic,
but her are going to be the executive

52
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:09,850
producer of really give,
took it to another label,

53
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,040
to another height.
And,

54
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,160
uh,
I think that's what was kind of

55
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,040
a highlight,
but I will

56
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,200
path.

57
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,730
I'm
good.

58
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,520
I'm on Jay and Martha,
I think this film is quite educational

59
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,420
because it does not necessarily judge
the community.

60
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,040
It does not necessarily,
uh,

61
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,670
you know,
sort of point the finger desert

62
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,190
community,
it sort of

63
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,400
shows,
you know,

64
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,550
where the thinking comes from.
It's sort of a mixture you to have a

65
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:59,270
conversation with yourself because it
makes,

66
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,350
it,
makes you,

67
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,530
it's not that easy a sort of a sin,
uh,

68
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,420
because this people,
they have lived half lived was a

69
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,090
practitioner for a number of years and
that's what they know.

70
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,640
That's what they believe from time to
time,

71
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:21,641
we need to go back to the drawing board
and we need to have a real conversation

72
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,620
on why these things are happening.
It's not enough to say,

73
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,430
well,
it's a culture where it's a tradition we

74
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,490
need to discuss about,
unpack and to discuss about why this is

75
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:38,090
happening.
