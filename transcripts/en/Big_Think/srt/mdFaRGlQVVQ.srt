1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,580
You know,
look over the last decade or so,

2
00:00:07,581 --> 00:00:11,450
I think the biggest shift we've seen as
sort of the final breakdown of the

3
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:14,570
traditional channel based structure of
the way we tend to think about

4
00:00:14,571 --> 00:00:18,260
communications as paid media,
earned media owned media,

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,440
um,
this sort of sort of traditional siloed

6
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:25,400
approach to communications that we still
hear a lot from marketing textbooks and

7
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,740
business school and that kind of thing.
Um,

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,370
I think what has happened is that the
process of the law,

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,600
the 20 years proceeding the last decade
was about fragmentation,

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,640
right?
New Types of channels,

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,190
um,
satellite TV and mobile networks and

12
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:44,900
just as incredible proliferation of
types of content and channels within the

13
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:49,901
silos that left people feeling like they
had infinite choice but left

14
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:53,300
communicators feeling like it was
impossible to reach an audience.

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,620
What social media has done,
particularly facebook and twitter have

16
00:00:57,621 --> 00:01:01,670
created a glue to knit all these
fragments back together into something

17
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:06,671
that feels like one big graph,
one big network of content moving

18
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:11,570
between channels and unpredictable ways
of engaging with people in ways that we

19
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,050
can't necessarily predict of creating
more.

20
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,210
Two directional conversational dialogues
and communication between individuals

21
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:22,910
and and the people that we're trying to
reach and inspire,

22
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:27,170
which is new behavior for us.
It requires marketers and communicators

23
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,990
and publishers to develop new skills
like listening,

24
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,450
right?
That we didn't used to have to do,

25
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:35,810
right?
We just pick the channel and we pick the

26
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:39,320
right message and we said something to
an audience that was mostly pretty

27
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:42,830
passive.
And I think this is the big shift in

28
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:46,040
thinking.
And the real challenge for a lot of

29
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:50,660
organizations is the world.
We are now part of a graph with the

30
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:54,560
people that we're trying to inspire
rather than them being a stable audience

31
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:58,190
that we're trying to reach.
And us being in a stable position as

32
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,050
inspire or publisher,
we now have to participate in the

33
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:03,651
system,
right?

34
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:05,990
People create content,
we create content,

35
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:07,640
they share content,
we share content.

36
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,020
And that means that we have to think
differently about how we communicate,

37
00:02:12,021 --> 00:02:14,600
how we tell stories,
how much content we have to create.

38
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,680
We can't reliably predict where that
content is going to get consumed.

39
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:23,681
So it's really easy to get into a
situation where if we're not really

40
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:28,220
clear about our values and our identity
and who we are and what we're trying to

41
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:31,280
achieve,
where sort of our values and mission sit

42
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,180
as an organization,
it can become really easy to sound

43
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,990
schizophrenia to the communities that
we're trying to engage.

44
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,040
And I think a lot of organizations are
still really struggling with this

45
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,620
transition.
It's still feels really unsettling to

46
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:49,790
folks because it means wholescale
changing of the way we think about

47
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:53,180
content and communication and publishing
even means different,

48
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,890
you know,
different org charts.

49
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,220
Rethinking how we shape the
organizations and design and staff and

50
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:04,060
how teams work together and how people
collaborate are all different than they

51
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:04,630
used to be.

52
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,430
And that's still a change process that I
think a lot of a lot of us in a lot of

53
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:11,020
organizations are still working their
way through.

54
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,660
So when we think about politics and we
think about what's changed in

55
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:17,590
communications,
one of the most important changes to the

56
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:22,150
communication landscape is the shift
from the necessity of being able to

57
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:24,070
listen effectively at scale.
Right?

58
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:28,810
The necessity of seeing the people that
were engaging as relationships we're

59
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:32,740
trying to create and the necessity of
empathy and listening as part of

60
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:37,741
starting relationships is fundamental to
communication now rather than either

61
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:42,850
orthogonal or accidental or you know,
a nice to have,

62
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,030
you know,
this is the fundamental nature of many

63
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:49,840
of the communication mechanisms.
We use our bi directional now and that

64
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:51,790
means our habits have to change.
Yeah,

65
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:55,270
I mean I think one of the,
one of the great advantages of digital

66
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:57,910
technologies is the capacity to listen
and scale.

67
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,670
That's something that wasn't possible
before.

68
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:02,200
Digital tools,
right?

69
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,700
The,
the ability to,

70
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,740
to take,
to use data and to use smart sort of

71
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,090
tools and listening to listening tools,
you know,

72
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:14,530
things like radian six and crimson
hexagon and there are a lot of these

73
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:19,090
platforms out there for the sort of UCM,
mostly in sort of enterprise marketing

74
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,520
spaces,
but work really well in politics and

75
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:24,610
social good and these other places to
get a sense for what people believe in,

76
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:28,330
think in social conversations.
Because so much of this conversation is

77
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:32,800
happening in public.
And so the question about listening is

78
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:35,050
mostly a cultural one,
right?

79
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:37,960
The tools,
it's tools aren't perfect and they're

80
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,800
not all,
you know,

81
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,910
some of them are pretty expensive.
So not necessarily the easiest things to

82
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:47,560
implement and building skills and hiring
people and thinking about this as,

83
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,310
as a skill set that needs to be part of
your team as part of this process.

84
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,790
But before any of that is a belief that
listening is important but a belief and,

85
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:03,361
and creating a culture where questioning
your own certainty and validating your

86
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:10,471
own certainty and putting the community
first in terms of how,

87
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,940
how you want to be able to reach and
inspire the people that you're trying to

88
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,970
engage,
whether that's selling a product or

89
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,620
trying to win an election,
right?

90
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,160
These things are,
this is just a function of how the

91
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:27,040
landscape works.
This is not particularly partisan.

92
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,410
It's not particularly about politics,
um,

93
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,550
but it requires a cultural belief in the
value of listening,

94
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,940
which is not something that,
that all leaders come by naturally.

95
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,100
Um,
and I think part of,

96
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,670
part of this is a discussion about the
value of empathy,

97
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,330
right?
And of the value of really the necessity

98
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:56,581
of understanding the values and beliefs
and emotions behind what people value

99
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:01,700
and believe as part of building real
relationships with people.

100
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,770
Um,
and this is where again,

101
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:08,300
digital tools make starting
relationships with more people easier,

102
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,750
but maintaining relationships is still
work,

103
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,810
right?
So this is one of the great challenges

104
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:19,640
of large scale community organizing,
which is the things that we were able to

105
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:22,100
do,
particularly back in 2008 with the first

106
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:27,101
Obama campaign when we were sort of
treading a lot of new ground just

107
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,140
because timing has a lot to do with the
success of a rain dance,

108
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,450
the,
that there's,

109
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,760
it created the ability for us to have
millions of volunteers,

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,180
which we could never have recruited
without these new platforms.

111
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,760
We just couldn't have had that many
meetings are we just wrote,

112
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,430
have run out of hours in the day and
time in the campaign.

113
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,530
And it allowed us to accelerate the
recruiting process and the engagement

114
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:56,120
process by creating more doors and more
ways into the campaign for more people.

115
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,260
But mainly making sure all of those
millions of people felt valuable.

116
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:05,261
And heard and respected and part of the
process and enabled to do good work that

117
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:10,010
had value that was on mission is an
enormous commitment of work and there

118
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:15,011
are thousands of field organizers in the
Obama community who did the work of

119
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:19,430
supporting those relationships.
And I think this is one of the big

120
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,750
shifts in thinking about from audience
to community,

121
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,650
right?
Where speaking at someone and saying the

122
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:32,180
right thing to you at the right time in
the right channel is a very linear

123
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:33,080
process,
right?

124
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:35,780
This is traditional microtargeting and
marketing,

125
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,000
right?
I need to figure out what you're

126
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:41,330
listening to or what you're watching so
I can show you the right message and

127
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:44,390
you're just going to consume it and it's
going to change your mind.

128
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,130
It's like this is a little bit the sort
of the Magic Madman idea,

129
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,640
right?

130
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,170
Like the perfect dad,
the perfect sort of great idea and there

131
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:57,620
is value to that.
Creativity and content is still super

132
00:07:57,621 --> 00:08:00,980
central to how we communicate and how we
tell stories.

133
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,760
But the process is not that linear
anymore.

134
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,210
And so thinking about how we engage
people as a relationship we are building

135
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:15,521
over time rather than just a transaction
at a moment in time is this is I think

136
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:19,460
the starting point to start bringing
these other ideas into the conversation

137
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:23,840
about empathy and what you think and
believe and feel and listening to you.

138
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:27,050
And people will tell you what they think
if you ask them.

139
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,670
This is the other,
you know,

140
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,740
people ask a lot of,
you know,

141
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:34,760
how do you know what people think?
And the answer is in politics we knock

142
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:37,460
on a lot of doors and we have a lot of
conversations,

143
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,590
hundreds of millions of them,
literally conversations where we are

144
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,800
asking questions and talking to voters
and asking what they think and who they

145
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:46,340
support.

146
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,310
And we keep all that data.
It is a massive listening exercise.

147
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:55,150
It's a massive exercise in is,
is our view and vision for the future

148
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,380
compelling and is it getting through,
are we making sense?

149
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:02,610
Are we reaching people and connecting
with people in a way that is relevant to

150
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:04,170
them?
Or are we missing something?

151
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,760
Um,
and people will tell you if you ask

152
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:10,950
them,
it's not actually that complicated.

153
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,680
It's just,
it's hard to do at scale.

154
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,290
And this is something that has to be
staffed for,

155
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,481
and the law,
the,

156
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:22,050
the piece of this that I think if the
first part is about culture or the last

157
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:26,070
part is about adjusting to,
there is a misconception that you can

158
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:27,930
just start publishing and just create a
page.

159
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:28,680
No one,
God,

160
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,980
you don't,
no one charges you or anything.

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,420
You just start doing stuff.
Creating content isn't free.

162
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,400
Responding to comments isn't free.
Being careful about the ladder of

163
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:41,520
engagement you're creating with people
and inspiring them and engaging with

164
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:43,320
them and answering their questions isn't
free.

165
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,070
Right?
That requires teams and talent and

166
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,640
energy and commitment to creativity that
you got to pay for.

167
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,890
And that's a place the staffing changes.
And the way this changes the way we

168
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:59,340
think about like communications
departments is pretty profound.
