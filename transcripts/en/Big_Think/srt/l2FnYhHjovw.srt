1
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,170
What
it is,

2
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,733
well,
let's step back,

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,950
what is it?
Bio dynamic wine.

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,150
There is a guy named Rudolf Steiner who,
a founder,

5
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:24,610
the founder,
the bite,

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,970
oh,
dynamic one movement and he had very

7
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:34,030
quirky ideas about making one,
but um,

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,390
many of these practices have proved to
um,

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,530
improve the sort of the vineyards,
the health of the vineyards and that's

10
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:45,350
what really we're talking about having
healthy vines and healthy healthy

11
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:50,351
grapes.
He was interested in harvesting in the

12
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:55,550
moonlight.
He was interested in um,

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,160
cow horns filled with dung,
planted in the vineyard.

14
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,120
So there's some quirky things that go
along with biodynamic wine.

15
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,800
Um,
but,

16
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,310
but basically we're talking about the
health of the vineyard and if you have a

17
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:13,910
healthy vineyard,
you should have a really great one with

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,940
organic.
It's actually a tricky proposition

19
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:19,450
because in terms of winemaking,
you,

20
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,760
what you're looking at usually is
organic grapes,

21
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,510
but there's an entire organic wine
making process that sometimes wine

22
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:30,230
makers will not carry through.

23
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,310
So is it.
The labeling is a little dicey.

24
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,970
So I think what we'll see is wines made
from organic grips,

25
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,030
probably not the entire process.
The ones that are,

26
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,860
um,
that are green and that,

27
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:47,940
um,
are not always reliable are the ones

28
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:52,280
that are made without sulfites.
And so I'm in France,

29
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:57,281
there's an enormous movement and there's
wine bars that just have these,

30
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,660
you know,
great ones,

31
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,700
green ones.
I mean,

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,900
without sulphites,
those ones aren't very stable.

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,630
Um,
because the sulfites helped to stabilize

34
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:06,920
the wine.
So,

35
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,910
um,
that I think is where you can get an

36
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:12,800
amazing,
amazing wine

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,490
without sulfites.
But boy,

38
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,270
you have to be complete.
