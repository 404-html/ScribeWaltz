1
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,550
What we're leaving,

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,420
uh,
10 15,

3
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:18,590
20 years from now.
You remind me of that.

4
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:23,591
All of the joke and the philosophy class
where the professor asks the students,

5
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:31,661
which is worse ignorance,
ignorance or apathy and some poor kid

6
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:35,090
from the back of the class says,
I don't know and I don't care.

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,360
Well,
I think it's an interesting question.

8
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:44,000
Is there an exciting way that we could
get the young people to this country

9
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,590
aware and their parents?
Because I refuse to believe that parents

10
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:55,130
have suddenly become cold and
indifferent to their own kids and

11
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:56,000
grandkids.
Parents,

12
00:00:56,001 --> 00:01:01,001
I think they've been deceived and a
misinformed and [inaudible] and so

13
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:06,560
forth.
So we have a political system today,

14
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:11,561
for example,
where the elderly are unbelievably well

15
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:15,380
represented.
The American Association of Retired

16
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,240
Persons as 38 dues paying member,
38 million dues paying members.

17
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,690
They write more,
they lobby Mar,

18
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:25,880
they call more.
And by and large,

19
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:29,750
it's not too unfair to say a lot of
their programs are.

20
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,540
We want more,
even though by any reasonable standard,

21
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,190
as I say,
some of these challenges are

22
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:38,690
unsustainable.
We can't,

23
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,430
we're not going to be able to meet the
promises that we've made.

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,170
So on the one hand,
we have these,

25
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:50,240
this culture of our ethic of shared
sacrifice,

26
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:54,380
being kind of a dirty word,
not wanting to give up anything.

27
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:59,410
We have political organizations who are
dominant in representing one age group

28
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,660
and the young people who are all about
the future or somehow being slipped.

29
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:12,831
This huge check,
hidden check I might add for our free

30
00:02:14,661 --> 00:02:18,820
lunch and nobody seems to be doing
anything about it.
