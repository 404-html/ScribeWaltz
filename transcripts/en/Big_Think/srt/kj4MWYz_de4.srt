1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,490
I think one of the really scary and
overwhelming things about terrorism can

2
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:14,491
be the idea that it's this giant Boogie
man that is really difficult to

3
00:00:14,651 --> 00:00:19,330
comprehend and is terrifying and comes
along in the night out of nowhere and

4
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:21,880
steals your family members or loved ones
away.

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,010
And for me,
my life's work has really been

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,340
understanding the small logical puzzle
pieces that when taken together create

7
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:38,500
that man so that you can take it apart
into manageable pieces and actually

8
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:43,120
begin to understand what drives these
inconceivable actions.

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,830
So when you take this overwhelming
boogie man of terrorism and you begin to

10
00:00:47,831 --> 00:00:51,040
tease it apart based on the data and
look for patterns,

11
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,600
the turnoff again and again,
each time a terrorist plot is planned in

12
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:57,910
a different territory throughout the
historical data,

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,010
you begin to notice patterns that might
not seem obvious to begin with.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,840
So things like the percentage beneath
livable wage that a border guard gets

15
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:10,810
paid,
which of course gives rise to the

16
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:15,811
possibility of accepting a bribe to let
somebody just sneak across the border or

17
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:21,040
hand to package to you if that bribe is
the difference between being able to

18
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:23,350
feed your kids that months or not.

19
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,740
It's a pretty understandable small
choice for that individual actor and yet

20
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:34,180
has given rise to perhaps a terrorist
act to being able to take place even

21
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:37,960
though the law of the territory should
have prevented it.

22
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,520
Another example would be the rate of
change of things like freedom of the

23
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:45,400
press or freedom of speech,
not the scores themselves,

24
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:49,690
but the rate of change which goes to the
difficulty that society's experience

25
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,220
when they suddenly open up and allow
liberties that many of the more

26
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:57,370
traditional members of society haven't
been accustomed to in the past.

27
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,850
There are strategies for taking
communities through those evolutions.

28
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,630
But without those strategies in place,
it can seem very jarring.

29
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,660
And we experienced that even in a mature
democracy like ours where when certain

30
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,680
changes take place quickly,
it can take portions of the community

31
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,250
time to be comfortable with them and to
catch up in a political environment.

32
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,060
Um,
another example would be the ratio of

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,960
who Kabar is to Madrasa was,
and there you begin to see,

34
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,530
you know,
tensions between more traditional

35
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,950
religious elements in society and a
younger demographic in many countries

36
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,220
where you have more than 50% in that
youth demographic.

37
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,540
There's a big cultural rift there that
can often give rise to lack of

38
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:51,040
understanding or the feeling that young
people are not being incorporated into

39
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:54,910
society and need some other outlet for,
uh,

40
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,580
for their feelings of,
of frustration.

41
00:02:57,581 --> 00:02:58,870
And,
and eventually,

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,200
um,
another really interesting one that we

43
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:07,201
see is how good machine translation is
for a local language.

44
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,150
So often we think that libraries in in
the olden days and and now the provision

45
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:19,610
of hardware and Internet access points
can be a great uh,

46
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,860
tool in the fight against extremism.
All of a sudden young people in a given

47
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,530
area have access to the sum total of
human knowledge.

48
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,550
How great is that?
And yet if the language that's spoken,

49
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,760
the dialect in that region is not very
well translated by Google translator or

50
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:40,030
other artificial intelligence programs,
then really access to the Internet for

51
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:44,200
the majority of young people who don't
necessarily speak another language or

52
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:49,201
dialect is not terribly meaningful
because they're generally seeing sights

53
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:55,111
that for small dialect are actually
created in their vicinity and may not

54
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:00,460
offer perspectives that are particularly
different from what they're hearing

55
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,820
around them in a given day.
So there are a number of these

56
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:06,040
correlations and the beauty,
you know,

57
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:09,010
my dad's a,
an economist and I grew up in a

58
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:12,160
household that loved throwing data
around around the dinner table.

59
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:17,161
And the beauty of data is that you can
look at huge sets across many different

60
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:24,940
time periods and geographies and see
patterns that emerged so starkly that

61
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:25,930
you can't ignore them.

62
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,850
These kinds of inputs are really helpful
in understanding how regular human

63
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:35,851
beings like you and me,
who grew up in different environments,

64
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,430
subject to different inputs,
could find themselves with different

65
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:41,530
perspectives about what's happening in
the world.

66
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,190
And eventually if their perspectives go
unheard,

67
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,460
feel increasing frustration that
eventually can find its outlet in a

68
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:52,000
violent way.
Well,

69
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:55,840
what's one of the things that I think is
very interesting outside of those just

70
00:04:55,841 --> 00:05:00,310
being intellectually interesting,
one of the practical applications of

71
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:05,311
that kind of study is to see where there
are easy,

72
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,560
cheap,
efficient ways to make,

73
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,890
uh,
a disproportionately big impact in

74
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:16,891
portions of the world where instead of
launching a kind of nebulous

75
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,880
multimillion dollar program that maybe
is not going to hit the milestones that

76
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:26,140
it's intending to hit,
you can go in with a very surgical and

77
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:31,141
efficient programs and make a
disproportionately large impact in the

78
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,400
lives of the people living in those
regions.

79
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:40,140
Okay.
