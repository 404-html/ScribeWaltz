1
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:13,030
I think our women's program got started
a lot sooner and with a lot more

2
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:17,040
seriousness than the rest of the world.
I think most,

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,360
most of the rest of the world doesn't
respect women's soccer.

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,610
Whereas here we're like,
that's great.

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,451
You know,
that's awesome.

6
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:28,170
And so we're gonna put the money and
resources into it to make them the best

7
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:30,840
team that they can be.
And I think we got a good jump on the

8
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:32,430
rest of the world in that fashion
because,

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,010
uh,
the rest of the world was like women's

10
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:35,910
soccer,
you know,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,340
I mean,
who's ever.

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,040
It's all about men's soccer everywhere
and that's all everybody cares about.

13
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,800
So even now,
even though they have women's national

14
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:46,650
teams in place,
there's still not that respect that we

15
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:48,590
give our women's national team here,
uh,

16
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,380
which is,
you know,

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,800
disappointing on a lot of levels for the
rest of the world.

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,650
But for here we give our women's
national team the same kind of coverage

19
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:57,750
would give them meds.
We give them the same respect.

20
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,310
I'm they have some great players and
it's cleared out the countries that have

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,540
started taking it a little more serious
in the women's game are starting to be

22
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,820
at our women's team and so,
you know,

23
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:10,020
there's seems to be,
you know,

24
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:13,860
like five or six top teams that uh,
the US included that are,

25
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,210
uh,
you know,

26
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,550
kind of just,
there's the,

27
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,480
is being switched back and forth now and
we don't,

28
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,510
us doesn't dominate as much.
Now there's some trepidation in the US

29
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,500
soccer camp that,
you know,

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,050
we might have lost our foothold and uh,
the women's soccer a spectrum.

31
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:29,770
So that's good.
It's good.

32
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,700
Only good for our program.
I'm glad to have some fear because they

33
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:34,530
were running the show for,
for a number of years.

34
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,020
Absolutely.
I think,

35
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:44,960
uh,
just a touch about the competition

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,220
angle.
I think once the other teams will say,

37
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:50,690
Germany,
Germany's got a very good women's

38
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:53,060
national team.
Once they kind of decided,

39
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:53,421
you know,
what,

40
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:56,480
we want our German team to win.
We don't want USA to win everything.

41
00:01:56,481 --> 00:01:59,670
Then they started being like,
then the competition comes in and the

42
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:02,840
pride comes in.
And so now they've got a great women's

43
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:06,680
national team and it competes with our
team in Brazil as well.

44
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,230
Uh,
just another country that it does some

45
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:10,070
of the same.
So,

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,490
uh,
I hope that would,

47
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,080
that would generate more respect for the
women's game.

48
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,120
Uh,
I don't see why it wouldn't,

49
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,420
but,
you know,

50
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,930
that being said,
it could just be a pride thing and I

51
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,270
don't want to lose the United States.
And I mean ultimately it's a good thing

52
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:25,100
all the way around,
just means more exposure for the women's

53
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:25,934
game.
Uh,

54
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,920
I have a 10 month old daughter at home
named Julia.

55
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,690
Uh,
and so,

56
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,170
uh,
I have a much different appreciation for

57
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:36,170
women's sports and I probably would have
otherwise because,

58
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,780
you know,
I want her to at least have that as an

59
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:39,980
option if that's something she wanted
to.
