1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,280
The way it's worked into my life,
curiosity and making movies and

2
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:10,281
television shows,
it's enabled me to be a better curator

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,630
of what's an original idea.
I think our first reflex is to go to the

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,730
Internet as opposed to seeking out new
people to meet because that's really a

5
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,690
disrupting your comfort zone.
I mean,

6
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:30,430
every time I do this,
um,

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,510
it's challenging.
It's just that isn't going to be your

8
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:36,630
natural reflex.
Your natural reflex is going to go to

9
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:38,550
google a subject,
Google the person,

10
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:39,900
oh,
yet I am Deb,

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,830
and that isn't how it's going to work.
But what you want to do is you want to

12
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:46,770
try to figure out how extraordinary
people become extraordinary.

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,330
Do I think kids normally just go to the
Internet and just stop there?

14
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,800
Probably because you are getting out of
your comfort zone.

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,860
Meeting a new person.
If you treat it as an act of generosity

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,450
that you are wanting to share part of
your life with somebody,

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,020
it will reduce your anxiety.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,940
When you reach out to somebody,
you go beyond just asking you a

19
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,850
question.
You might give them a piece of

20
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:21,090
information.
Like when I've met some famous designers

21
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:26,091
like Vivienne Westwood,
I come to Vivienne Westwood immediately

22
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,030
with an olive branch.
I immediately say to Vivienne Westwood,

23
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,450
what do you think of this new
soundtrack?

24
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,320
Or what do you think of this piece of
music?

25
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,790
Because look,
designing it goes hand in hand with

26
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:39,361
music.
I mean,

27
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:42,420
you know,
music is going to be some compatibility

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,890
to fashion.
Ultimately what I'm trying to do is find

29
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:51,891
a way to intersect with how their psyche
it actually works.

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,560
So what I'm trying to do is understand
very quickly what is it that they are

31
00:01:58,021 --> 00:02:03,021
going through emotionally because
emotionally what they're going through

32
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,400
is going to relate to what they do and
achieve professionally.

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,740
And what's deeper than that,
um,

34
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,380
is what do they think is their purpose
in life?

35
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:18,900
What is valuable to them?
I mean,

36
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:23,550
what has meaning in their life?
I made it probably the deep truth of,

37
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,730
of what we're trying to understand
within our solar system as human beings

38
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,160
and even as we try to get outside of our
solar system.

39
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:33,360
What is this all about?
