1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,593
Okay.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,190
Wow.
They should coexist alongside each

3
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:12,290
other.
They shouldn't intertwined.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,710
I think part of the difficulty is that
one man's faith is another man's heresy,

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,420
or one woman's faith.
There's another woman's Harrison.

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,670
I'm the chief rabbi of England,
recently wrote a book called the dignity

7
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:27,530
of difference.
Jonathan sacks.

8
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:29,450
He was actually contemporary of mine at
Oxford,

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,120
and he wrote something that has stuck
with me.

10
00:00:32,121 --> 00:00:34,220
He said,
there's only one truth in heaven,

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,640
but there are many truths on earth.
Well,

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,760
you know,
truth is supposed to be indivisible.

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,510
You know,
it's,

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,510
it's binary.
Either it is or it isn't.

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,510
But once you accept that there was more
than one truth on earth,

16
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,020
then you can't say,
it has to be my way.

17
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,100
You know,
I believe there's a divine power.

18
00:00:55,101 --> 00:00:57,650
There's a God and God will figure it
out,

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,800
but that's in heaven.
And so mixing religion and politics,

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,230
um,
is a pretty dangerous admixture in my

21
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:07,064
view.

22
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,290
[inaudible].
