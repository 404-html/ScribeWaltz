1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,870
Oh,
I'm optimistic.

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,570
I think,
um,

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,190
I,
I wouldn't be involved in politics if I

4
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:22,191
weren't optimistic about the ability of
the human race to,

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,340
to address the problems that we face and
move forward.

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,250
Well,
one thing is watching my grandchildren.

7
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,370
It's some of these students that I've
had the opportunity to work with during

8
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:45,531
my time at Harvard and see how committed
they are and how,

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,770
how much they want to make a difference
in the world.
