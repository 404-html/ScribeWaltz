1
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,300
Well,
um,

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,680
I had been to Afghanistan,
uh,

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,480
previously that was my first covering of
a war,

4
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,990
but I had written for rolling stone for 
a few years.

5
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:28,340
And the short answer is I would always 
write about youth subcultures,

6
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:30,110
like skateboarders,
criminals,

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,760
radical environmentalist.
And I pitched my editor the idea that,

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,020
hey,
I'll cover the military.

9
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:38,300
It's another youth sub culture.
Um,

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,523
but I think the other reason I wanted to
go to Iraq because I studied history in 

11
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:45,200
school.
I was fascinated by it more actually.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,790
And I had also previously worked at 
Hustler magazine as a,

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,860
as an editor,
as an editor there.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,753
And I,
I always felt that when I worked at 

15
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:56,474
Hustler,
we are beneficiaries of the first 

16
00:00:57,651 --> 00:00:59,090
amendment.
And I thought,

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,730
now here's another way to,
um,

18
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,340
to,
to live the first amendment.

19
00:01:04,341 --> 00:01:05,174
The military is giving me the 
opportunity to cover the war from the 

20
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:08,960
front.
And I feel it.

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,770
Um,
when I first covered troops,

22
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,720
it was in Afghanistan and I was a 
little,

23
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,560
I spent a month with a heavy weapons 
platoon in Kandahar.

24
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,590
And with those guys,
I was always sort of like,

25
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,980
should I let them know that I worked for
hustler cause I thought maybe they'll be

26
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:37,550
angry or some it'll offend some born 
again Christian or something.

27
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,653
And it,
it got out and it really increased my 

28
00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:45,260
respect and acceptance in that platoon.
So by the time I got to Iraq or to,

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,900
to the Marine Corp prior to the invasion
of Iraq,

30
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,063
I kind of knew in a minute,
in a manipulative journalistic way that 

31
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:54,860
hustler was a good card to play.
Um,

32
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,590
but it's more of a humorous thing.
Like they,

33
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,200
I knew that they would laugh about it.
Um,

34
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,093
what really I think made them accept me 
as much as they did and not everyone 

35
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:06,704
accepted me was just the fact that I 
stayed with them and I believe in 

36
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:11,300
journalism,
nothing beats,

37
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,160
um,
time and persistence.

38
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,790
Just follow people around and they kind 
of,

39
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:17,624
it breaks down the barriers.
The fact that I followed them around 

40
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,210
after we were getting shot at and ambush
of course also helps.

41
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,933
Okay.

42
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,970
In Afghanistan,
we had some rocket attacks and there are

43
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:39,430
big issues with land mines that were 
blowing people up.

44
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,300
That was a different sort of tension the
first time.

45
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,680
In fact,
it was a worst,

46
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,473
just the fear of the fear of landmines 
that we had in Afghanistan was worse 

47
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,143
than actually being shot at.
And the first time I was really shot at 

48
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,380
was at the bridge at Nasiriyah,
which will be depicted in episode of the

49
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:01,360
mini series.
And it was like,

50
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,330
strangely enough,
very exciting.

51
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,590
And it was strangely enough,
I,

52
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,360
I,
and this was voiced by marines that were

53
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,310
by my side,
it was like,

54
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:13,960
wow,
this is just like a movie.

55
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,183
And it's weird to me that my reference 
point and their reference point was 

56
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:19,810
movies.
But that's the case.

57
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,160
It was,
I mean to see,

58
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,110
um,
you know,

59
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:23,944
and for some reason to have like a 
mortar blow up sort of near you and you 

60
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:31,861
feel the overpressure and you to see a 
machine gun fire tearing into trees over

61
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,290
your head,
even though it's scary.

62
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,124
It's very exciting.

63
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,890
Well,
I think that,

64
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,310
um,
they were all dangerous.

65
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:52,530
I mean,
once you start getting shot at,

66
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,760
you know,
who knows?

67
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:56,520
But who knows what's going to happen.
But for me,

68
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,740
this happened time and time again.
We were in a convoy moving forward.

69
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:06,741
So at times a unit would have moved 
ahead of us and they would say,

70
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:07,794
okay,
you're going to have enemy contact in 

71
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:12,570
five minutes when you,
when you reached this turn in the road.

72
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,360
So then you're in the Humvee and you 
know,

73
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,220
hey,
the last guys that drove up here,

74
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,360
they took rpg and machine gun fire.
It's going to happen to you next.

75
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,090
It was the anticipation that was always 
the scariest.

76
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,890
Well,
when I came back from Iraq,

77
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,290
um,
a lot of my friends were like,

78
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,153
oh,
you know,

79
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,420
wow,
you were in combat.

80
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:43,660
It must be,
you saw something that no one else could

81
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:46,210
ever understand unless they've been 
there.

82
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:47,044
And actually I disagreed with that.
The weirdest thing is there was an 

83
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:55,321
element of being in combat that 
confirmed to me what I'd read about it.

84
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,510
And I'd read studied history.
So I'd read a lot about it.

85
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,613
And it was weird as a writer and a 
person who's sort of live the life of 

86
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:04,600
the imagination,
I was like,

87
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:06,970
wow,
it's really cool that my imagination did

88
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:10,090
actually prepare me for what combat 
would be like.

89
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,193
So there was an element of it that was 
very familiar based on my intense 

90
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:15,544
reading as a history student.
But the one thing that I really saw in 

91
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:23,991
Iraq graphically and I'd never quite 
understood was how attractive war is for

92
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:26,410
the combatants.

93
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,603
That basically in Iraq you had these 
young Marines who had prepared for war 

94
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,530
and it was pretty exciting for them to 
finally get a chance to be in it.

95
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,603
And on the other side,
many of the people that were attacking 

96
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:42,880
us,
we're professional Iraqi soldiers now,

97
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:46,750
many of them were actually working as 
insurgents because the,

98
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,010
the Saddam's military had prepared for 
an insurgency as we invaded,

99
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,930
but they were professional combatants.
So you had these young men on both sides

100
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:59,480
that were sort of fulfilling their 
dreams.

101
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,281
They,
it was,

102
00:06:00,281 --> 00:06:02,630
it was very self actualizing for the 
Marines,

103
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:05,090
as I'm sure it was for the Iraqis.
And,

104
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,210
and it was a war is attractive to those 
guys.

105
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:12,350
But in between is this massive civilians
who are being slaughtered,

106
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:16,040
who are suffering.
And I'd never quite realized a,

107
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,450
that,
uh,

108
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,480
for combatants war is kind of attractive
and be that truly what happens in war is

109
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:25,790
just civilians just get fucked.
You know,

110
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,190
there's no there,
there is no glory.

111
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:30,590
There's nothing for them except for 
pain,

112
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,430
misery,
death,

113
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,610
suffering.
And you really see it in Iraq.

114
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,483
I really saw it.

115
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,313
Okay.
