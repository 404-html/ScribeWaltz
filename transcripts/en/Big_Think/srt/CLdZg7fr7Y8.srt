1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,180
Again,
I'd have to say

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,700
the first thing everyone should ask
themselves is what does it mean to be

3
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:13,540
realistic and is realistic,
the same thing as resigning.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,100
The second thing is to acknowledge that
more is possible in your life that

5
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:27,841
almost anybody ever told you,
and the third is to think about the

6
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:36,100
following thought experiment which was
brought up by content.

7
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,970
It's so it's.
I find it very helpful,

8
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,370
carved in discrete terms.
This was the 18th century.

9
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:49,240
He asks us to imagine a man who cannot
resist,

10
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:53,020
says he can't resist temptation.
Every time he walks by a certain house,

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,000
I mean it's a brothel,
but if you put a gallows in front of the

12
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:00,850
brothel and he knew that he would go to
be hung,

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,340
the minute he walked out,
he would find that he could resist

14
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:04,680
temptation very well.
Okay,

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,440
so we all agree that love of life trumps
every other physical desire that you

16
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:14,290
have.

17
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,880
Whether it's for sex or food or whatever
form of pleasure does it for you.

18
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,390
Love of life is the basis of every other
pleasure.

19
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,420
Then imagine the same man is asked to
sign a letter condemning an innocent

20
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:34,411
person to death and he's threatened by
an unjust tyrant with death himself,

21
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,580
unless he cooperates in the innocent
man's death.

22
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,110
And what concept is is none of us know
what we would do in that situation.

23
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:49,350
Most of us would probably be cowards,
but all of us know what we should do and

24
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:55,951
all of us therefore know that we would
be free to do the right thing and to

25
00:01:56,231 --> 00:02:01,150
refuse to participate in injustice even
if it would cost our own lives.

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,480
And I think furthermore,
I think everybody can perform that

27
00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:07,570
experiment.
I've tried it out on a number of people.

28
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,520
I think furthermore that everybody has
one hero either in real life or in

29
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:15,790
fiction,
who they would like to be in at least

30
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:16,300
one moment.

31
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,190
You may think you can't live up to that
person,

32
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,730
but you have one person who you think
would act rightly in that situation.

33
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,910
I think we should keep those people in
mind.

34
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:34,350
Of course,
hopefully being a good person doesn't

35
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:39,190
involve sacrificing your life and in
fact,

36
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:44,191
sometimes it's easier to be good and
rather banal and simple way is that it

37
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:49,060
is to go out in one great heroic
gesture.

38
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,450
So I think the last thing in being a
good person that's important to

39
00:02:52,451 --> 00:02:55,060
remember,
if evil can be banal and I think it can

40
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:57,910
be goodness is also,
but now to it consistent,

41
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,470
ordinary,
everyday action.
