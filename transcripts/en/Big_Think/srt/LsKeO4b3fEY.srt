1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,083
Okay.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,350
Our business focuses us on diversity
because we all work in a sport that was

3
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:16,491
deemed too black to thrive and actually
even survive.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,700
People Forget.
But there were articles,

5
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:23,970
the dark clouds over the NBA,
you know,

6
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:24,661
mirror.
I had,

7
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:27,510
I literally,
when I was executive vice president,

8
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:32,340
Larry sent me up to a newspaper and the,
uh,

9
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:35,250
the television guy said,
you don't get it stern.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,430
You guys are just not going to make it.
This is a white country and you have a

11
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:46,050
black sport.
So we developed chips on our shoulder

12
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:49,890
early on.
If you worked at the NBA in the 70s,

13
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,310
you had to be a believer that America
was a good country and that we had

14
00:00:56,701 --> 00:01:01,260
something to teach rather than to be
afraid of a sport,

15
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,740
you know,
that could have Willis Reed from

16
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:09,741
Louisiana and grambling and the bill
Bradley from a Crystal City,

17
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:15,570
Missouri and Princeton on a championship
team.

18
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,690
Hmm.
That says something about a sport that

19
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:22,200
has something to teach that's about,
that's about talent.

20
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,970
We sort of rallied around the notion
that if you came to an NBA game,

21
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,140
it didn't matter where you sat,
you know,

22
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,580
whether you were in the nosebleed
section or at court side,

23
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:36,390
your opinion counted.
And regardless of your race,

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,270
and if you were on the court,
you're,

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,850
your talent counted regardless of your
race.

26
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,990
You got game,
you play,

27
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:44,010
you don't have game,
you don't.

28
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,110
And so this was a subject of some
discussion at the NBA always on an

29
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:52,530
ongoing basis.
And it has ramifications throughout our

30
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:54,990
whole business.
When I was,

31
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:55,950
uh,
uh,

32
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,510
required to act when Ron,
our test,

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,040
uh,
ran into the stands in Detroit and there

34
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,640
was a big brawl,
et Cetera,

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,560
the talk radio that weekend,
you,

36
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,740
the words thugs and punks was uttered
what seem to be about a million times,

37
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,250
I'm sure it was less,
but we will know the code words.

38
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,340
And,
and so we're,

39
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,380
we tend to be particularly protective of
our players in that regard.

40
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:29,880
And I think it makes us conscious of a
lot of different things,

41
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,520
uh,
having to do with the racial discussion.
