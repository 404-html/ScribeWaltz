1
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,830
I'm Danny Meyer and I'm the CEO of the
Union Square hospitality group in New

2
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,830
York City.
I think the key has been to start every

3
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:24,630
restaurant with a sharp point of view,
so we go into each restaurant knowing

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,500
what it is we're trying to say.
It's like writing a story but,

5
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,870
but then here's where it's different
from a story.

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,910
It's a highly interactive experience and
so the people who come to the restaurant

7
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,790
may like part of your original point of
view,

8
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,820
but they may want you to do things a
little bit differently and so then it

9
00:00:42,821 --> 00:00:47,821
really becomes an ongoing dialogue where
you're listening to how the people who

10
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:53,020
like your restaurant would like it even
more if only you shifted a little bit

11
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,720
and so you're having a dialogue with
your guests.

12
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:57,310
You're having a dialogue with your
staff.

13
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:03,150
I think it's really important to keep
the staff is engaged as possible because

14
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:07,450
at the end of the day,
the restaurant itself as an inanimate

15
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:11,740
object and it's the human beings who
work there that are the reason that

16
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,290
people like you either want to come back
or not and there's a fine line,

17
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,050
you know,
I'm knocking on wood right now,

18
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:25,051
but in 24 years I've never had the
experience of closing the restaurant and

19
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:26,963
the,
the,

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the real fine line is that you've,
you've got to give people enough of the

21
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:36,640
things they returned for,
but you've got to give people enough new

22
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:40,990
things so they'll come back as well and
if you take away all the reasons that

23
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:43,900
they came,
they came back,

24
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,980
they may not want to return,
but if you don't change things they may

25
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:48,760
not want to return.

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,930
So there's the art.

27
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,440
What any of the new media is,
is actually very old,

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,610
which is that,
that it's human nature to want to

29
00:02:04,611 --> 00:02:09,611
recommend things to people you like and
to want to denigrate things to people

30
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,150
you liked that you didn't like.
I think that's,

31
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:16,880
that's always been human nature.
We used to call it word of mouth,

32
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,220
now it's word of the elk or word of
twitter or whatever,

33
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,910
and so it's really not a new thing,
but I think that that anyone who has any

34
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:32,300
kind of a business who's not paying
attention to what the world or what

35
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:34,910
their customers are saying is,
is making a mistake.

36
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:39,911
Now,
it's equally important that if you're a

37
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:41,024
radio,

38
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,650
you want to have antenna that are sharp
enough to pick up the stuff that's out

39
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:50,770
there,
but if,

40
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,440
if your antenna are so sensitive that
they pick up everything,

41
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,790
you're going to pick up static as well
that may not be particularly useful.

42
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:03,791
So such a critical thing to learn to
tune in the constructive stuff and tune

43
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:10,441
out the stuff that's just hurtful.
The restaurant will be 11 years old this

44
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,210
year.
And,

45
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:19,960
uh,
I think the secret of any restaurant is

46
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:23,530
you've just got to stick at it.
You've got to stick to the things that

47
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:26,020
you believe in and you've got to listen
really carefully.

48
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:29,290
In the case of 11 Madison Park,
we listened very,

49
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:33,670
very carefully and we realized that our
early point of view wasn't necessarily

50
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:38,671
on the money rather than people using it
when we first opened it as a Brasserie,

51
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:44,881
which is pretty much what I had
envisioned it as they said in instead of

52
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,360
saying this is the best brasserie food
I've ever had in my life,

53
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,540
which it would have been if they wanted
to use it as a brasserie.

54
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:58,030
They said this food doesn't seem to be
stacking up against this gorgeous decor,

55
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,900
and so in order to make 11 Madison Park
into a restaurant that could fulfill its

56
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:09,130
greatest potential,
we had to not only listen to our guests,

57
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:11,740
but we had to listen to the architecture
because the architecture,

58
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,050
the bones of that building are not going
to change.

59
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:19,051
It's a gorgeous,
beautiful space with no light streaming

60
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:22,390
in.
And so I feel like we finally gave the

61
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:24,520
space,
the restaurant it deserved.

62
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,780
I moved to New York because I couldn't
get out of my system.

63
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:36,430
I'm a midwesterner and I,
I really thought that I'd end up maybe

64
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:40,390
in Chicago.
I felt like St Louis might not be quite

65
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:42,820
big enough for me,
but I'd gone to school in Connecticut at

66
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:47,821
Trinity College and I spent a lot of my
weekends down in the city just eating

67
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,840
the city.
Literally.

68
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,860
I went to the horse races.
I would go to Broadway shows that go to

69
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:58,861
watch jazz restaurants obviously,
and I just like looking at people.

70
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:04,711
I liked the jolt of energy that,
that I got when I drove off the FDR

71
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:09,310
drive into the city for the first time,
which I presume is still there,

72
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:12,220
but now that it's part of me,
I don't feel it quite to the same

73
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:17,221
degree,
but I could literally feel a jolt and I

74
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:18,311
just,
you know,

75
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:23,311
I'm curious.
I like to look at how any block on the

76
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,810
street can change.
Literally from day to day.

77
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,410
Storefront can change.
You can look up and see,

78
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,650
you know,
windows up above that have changed the

79
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:37,651
kind of human beings that are seemingly
from every corner of the earth who have

80
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:41,860
something to say and something to
express are here.

81
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,800
And that's what I wanted.
When I first came to New York,

82
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:47,230
I didn't think I would probably be here
for more than a year,

83
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,960
but a one year has now turned into a
quarter of a century and I'm still here.

84
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,580
I grew up in St Louis,
Missouri and I basically have,

85
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,270
you know,
two incredibly fond memories of being a

86
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:07,940
teenager there.
As soon as I could get the keys to my

87
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:11,150
parent's car.
One was going to Ted drewes frozen

88
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:15,770
custard and one was going to stay,
can shake where back in those days they

89
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:18,380
had a curbside service.
So,

90
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,190
you know,
you would have after a party you go to

91
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:25,460
steak and shake or after going to you're
a rock concert and go to steak and

92
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:27,320
shake.
And it was uh,

93
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,050
it,
it dawned on me when we had an

94
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:33,830
opportunity to create a reason for
people to use this beautiful park,

95
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:37,220
Madison Square Park,
morning,

96
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:39,770
noon and night.
And that makes a park safer when people

97
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:43,340
are using it.
That in New York where we don't have a,

98
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,400
an automobile culture necessarily,
we still have reasons that human beings

99
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:49,250
want to get together.

100
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,100
And,
and so whereas these burger and shake

101
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:54,320
stands,
you know,

102
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:56,270
from the 19 fifties,
19 sixties,

103
00:06:56,271 --> 00:07:01,130
even the 19 seventies really grew up in
areas where people use their cars and

104
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:03,080
they would hang out in the parking lot.
We said,

105
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:05,000
well,
why can't a parking lot be a park?

106
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,810
And that's how it came to be and tell
you what we envisioned or we dreamed of

107
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:15,440
what it could be,
but never imagined that people would

108
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:17,030
fall in love to the degree that they
have

109
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,640
shack burger.
But I'll,

110
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:26,960
I'll eat almost anything on the menu.
It's not really a very long menu.

111
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,080
I mean,
I'm very happy getting a Chicago dog.

112
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:32,540
I love the bird dog,
which is the,

113
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,130
uh,
chicken bratwurst.

114
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,710
I'm in total love with the shroom burger
and a,

115
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,810
my favorite custard of all which,
which I just asked people to make for

116
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:46,700
me.
And sometimes it's on the menu is the,

117
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:49,880
uh,
just getting vanilla custard with coffee

118
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:50,714
in it.

119
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,530
There's no one that I look to now for
any one thing,

120
00:07:57,531 --> 00:08:01,790
but there are definitely people,
sadly,

121
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:06,140
many of them are no longer living that I
think about when I get to a crossroads.

122
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:11,410
I think about my dad who entirely gave
me my love for food and wine and no

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,560
giving,
showing people a good time.

124
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,550
He had been in the travel business and
even had a couple of restaurants before

125
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:24,170
he died.
I think of my maternal grandfather who

126
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,200
really helped to show me that it's
reasonable enough to invest in your

127
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:31,880
community because it's the right thing
to do,

128
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:33,680
but also that it's good business to do
that.

129
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,780
And um,
from a professional restaurant

130
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:41,360
standpoint,
I think of another person who passed

131
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:45,470
away a few years ago from Paris named
John Claude free,

132
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:48,620
not who ran a fantastic restaurant
called Thai avant.

133
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,350
And he really showed me that,
that having a really,

134
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:59,351
really refined restaurant did not need
to be exclusive from having a good sense

135
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:03,360
of humor that you could have fun taking
service seriously.

136
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,670
Oh boy.
I'd probably think about my 21st

137
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:16,671
birthday at a Trattoria in Rome.
And it was a simple meal,

138
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:21,750
but it was great.
The auntie pasta was perfect.

139
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:26,751
The Spaghetti Alla Carbonara was right
on the money liters and liters of cheap

140
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:29,640
red wine.
That was just fine.

141
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,830
Vitiello Allah Bolin was just perfect
for me.

142
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,610
A great meal has as much to do with the
people I'm with

143
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,870
and the comfort that I feel in the
setting.

144
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,880
The food has to be absolutely delicious.
But I think that sometimes people put

145
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:52,050
too much emphasis on always having to
find the best.

146
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,260
If I hadn't answered that particular
meal in Rome,

147
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,070
the other place I was thinking about
would be just getting a great pizza.

148
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,870
You know,
I could have a sausage and mushroom

149
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:05,040
pizza at one of a handful of places in
new haven,

150
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:09,300
Connecticut,
and be just as happy as a clam.

151
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,193
No Pun intended.

152
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,150
I don't think it's your job to look
smart when you go to a restaurant.

153
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,150
I think you should be with the person
you're with.

154
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,810
If you're a solo diner,
that's also good than be with yourself.

155
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,870
Enjoy the place.
But I think a restaurant that forces you

156
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:35,271
to look a certain way or act a certain
way for their benefit is automatically

157
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,910
making a mistake because they're not
letting you be you and they're not.

158
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,340
They're not on your side really.
So actually one of the first things that

159
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:50,370
I would cage when I go to any restaurant
is to.

160
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:54,600
I feel at home here because there's no
law that says I have to go to this

161
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:56,580
restaurant.
There's no law that says I have to spend

162
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:59,870
my hard earned money at this restaurant.
If,

163
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,090
if I've heard great things about a
restaurant from a friend,

164
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,860
that's helpful because if it's a friend
than they presumably know me and they're

165
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:11,010
going to know that this kind of place is
gonna make me feel good or not.

166
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,390
But my rule number one is you're there
for yourself.

167
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:17,490
You're not there for me.
When you go to a restaurant,

168
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,890
I don't really pay too much attention to
the notion of what knight I'm ordering.

169
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:30,891
Something I would make one distinction
if New York City or anywhere has been in

170
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:35,910
the midst of a two or three week
heatwave in the middle of summer,

171
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,880
probably not a great time to get
oysters,

172
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,260
which just,
not that they're going to be bad for you

173
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:45,360
necessarily,
but they just won't taste good and at

174
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:49,050
the end of the day you're buying,
when you go out to a restaurant,

175
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:53,530
you're buying an opportunity to take
time off to restore yourself.

176
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:55,180
That's what the word restaurant comes
from,

177
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,210
but you're also buying pleasure.
You shouldn't be buying pleasure.

178
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,160
Um,
I think that good restaurants

179
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,980
today should totally be able to keep
fresh fish fresh in their refrigeration

180
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:14,551
system regardless of whether the
delivery came in today or yesterday or

181
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:18,730
the day before.
And the fact of the matter is very few

182
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,760
pieces of fish that any of us eat.
We're swimming yesterday anyway.

183
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,660
We would all like to believe that,
but a lot of the big fishing boats that

184
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:31,540
go out sometimes are out for a week
before the fish comes back.

185
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,320
I think that,
like anything else in life,

186
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,850
every coin has two sides to it.
And I,

187
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,920
I think that the good thing about more
and more food on television is that

188
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,840
we're now in a country where
good ingredients and,

189
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,780
and good cooking and good recipes are
not a foreign concept to people.

190
00:12:58,781 --> 00:13:02,290
People are much,
much more aware of the role that food

191
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:06,630
can play at the table.
And I think that young people watch the

192
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,010
food network.
Last time I checked it's rated g,

193
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,630
most of the stories have a happy ending
and you know,

194
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:17,620
I,
I think that that the to the degree that

195
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:22,621
Julia child was able to make an impact
on a whole generation of people when she

196
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:26,860
was the only game in town,
I think the food network is,

197
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,750
believe it or not,
having an even bigger impact on even

198
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,410
more people.
And so I think that from a standpoint of

199
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:36,190
being a restaurant tour,
it's a good thing because more and more

200
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,790
people are interested in and follow
what's happening in the food scene.

201
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:45,330
The other side of the coin is that
the restaurant business is not a sitcom

202
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,190
and it's not
a reality TV show.

203
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,900
It's,
it's a real dated day,

204
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,170
persistent journey about delivering
pleasure for other people and it's a

205
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,930
very,
very humble pursuit and I think that

206
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,100
the,
the part of the,

207
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,180
of the TV aspect of food that,
that may be less helpful is that what

208
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,580
plays well on TV is sometimes brashness
as opposed to humility.

209
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:23,910
Serving other people is a humble act.
It's the belief that if I do something

210
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:28,180
for you
that's gonna make me feel better.

211
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,840
Sometimes that's not what's portrayed on
TV.

212
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,430
It's cursing and tattoos and brashness,
which is fine,

213
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,590
but that's not really what the pleasure
of the table is all about.

214
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,770
No,
I,

215
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,330
I think we'll see some changes and I
think we always have.

216
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:54,331
One of the things that's amazing about
my industry is that there's,

217
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,130
there's just this incredible,
um,

218
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,470
sense that there's always going to be a
tomorrow and you know,

219
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:05,180
I've,
I've now been in business long enough to

220
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:10,181
have seen for pretty serious recessions,
unfortunately so far to have survived

221
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:11,980
them all.
But it's,

222
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,950
it's like a mean,
nasty wind that blows a heck of a lot of

223
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:20,300
the leaves off the trees.
What I find amazing about my colleagues,

224
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,560
there's this never say die
entrepreneurial spirit and behind every

225
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:27,310
leaf that falls off,
there's a new bud that,

226
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,800
that,
that you know,

227
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,500
blooms and blossoms.
What's fascinating is to see what each

228
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,500
recession generates in terms of the next
generation of,

229
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,750
of restaurants.
You know,

230
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,760
I'll never forget all the way back in
1991,

231
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,210
1992 when there was a recession
connected with the Gulf War.

232
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,930
Everybody was saying back then,
this is the end of fine dining,

233
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,010
which was totally not true.
There was a period during which people

234
00:15:55,011 --> 00:16:00,011
were eating more casually,
but we have long since passed the point

235
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:05,441
as a country where people are not going
to go backwards in terms of the quality

236
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,630
of what they eat.
No one's going to say,

237
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,980
oh,
it's a recession now.

238
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:12,080
I want to eat food that doesn't taste
good.

239
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,560
What they might say is,
okay,

240
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:18,740
I don't want to spend as much money or I
don't have as much time,

241
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,280
or I don't want to pay extra for all the
trappings of cushy chairs and beautiful

242
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:28,430
art on the walls and that type of thing
does come and go,

243
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,310
um,
the,

244
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,750
the restaurant that will be opening this
fall,

245
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,570
which will be called Maialino,
um,

246
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,760
based on my love for Rome is without
question a recession baby,

247
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,930
it's going to be a restaurant that,
that I would hope that people could

248
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:49,550
frequent even in a recession that won't
put it out of business,

249
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,460
you know,
during a good economy.

250
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,940
But what's,
what I also find fascinating blue smoke,

251
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,660
which is our barbecue restaurant that
has thrived throughout this whole

252
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:04,130
recession,
was born just a handful of months after

253
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:06,200
nine slash 11.
And it was born in a recession.

254
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:11,180
Two thousand and two.
And sometimes the restaurants that the

255
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:15,230
buds to blossoms that,
that come to life during a recession or

256
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:17,300
some of the most long lived.
As a result of that,

257
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,940
you know,
a Trattoria in Rome.

258
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:24,140
There are thousands of them and nobody
goes there to find cutting edge.

259
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,140
Nobody goes there only for special
occasions.

260
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,160
What distinguishes one Trattoria from
the next is the one that you go to the

261
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:33,860
most frequently.
So there are restaurants that are

262
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:38,750
created really for the purpose of
allowing people to be with people and to

263
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:41,870
break bread without a lot of the
trappings,

264
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:46,930
without paying extra money for the fancy
plates and the expensive furnishings in

265
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:49,394
the restaurant.

266
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,950
And it's really more about the soul of,
of eating well than it is of the refined

267
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:58,230
restaurant experience.
I don't believe that the refined

268
00:17:58,231 --> 00:18:03,231
restaurant experience
ever thrives as much in a deep

269
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:07,110
recession.
But I also believe that there's always

270
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:09,080
going to be a place,
um,

271
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,130
you know,
for a restaurant that is,

272
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:17,330
that just gives you that extra sense
that you took a trip somewhere.

273
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,890
We have a restaurant,
11 Madison Park that just got four stars

274
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:25,470
from the New York Times and by all,
by all rights,

275
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,340
it should not be doing well in a
recession and it's doing better now than

276
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:34,341
ever.
I think that the things that keep me up

277
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:40,911
at night are the responsibility that I
feel towards the people who signed up to

278
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:45,030
work with me.
You know,

279
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:50,090
as as we grow as an organization,
it's.

280
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:56,350
It's really growing.
How many human beings are producing our

281
00:18:56,531 --> 00:19:00,220
restaurants.
It's if you go to union square cafe or

282
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:03,520
Tabula or shake shack or the modern
tonight

283
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,440
and you have any comment experience,
I hope it'll be a great one,

284
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,960
but that experience will be a direct
result of the performance of the human

285
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:18,961
beings who work there and their
performance will be a direct result of

286
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:24,780
how happy they are working there and how
productive they feel and how jazzed they

287
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:28,540
feel in terms of the colleagues that
they work with.

288
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,953
How

289
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,920
you know,
how well we've helped them learn and

290
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:39,921
prepare for their job and when we let
our own employees down in any way,

291
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:42,450
shape or form.
That keeps me up at night because I know

292
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:46,020
that that's going to immediately
translate to our employees letting down.

293
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:46,130
Yeah.
