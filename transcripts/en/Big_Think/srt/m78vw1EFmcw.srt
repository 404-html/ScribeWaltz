1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,680
There's a lot of talk nowadays about the
psycho therapeutic use of psychedelics

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:06,720
were kind of going through a psychedelic
renaissance.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,320
It's been a while since the 19 sixties.
These substances have been repressed,

4
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:14,660
but mankind has been using and
experimenting with entheogenic or God

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,720
facilitating substances for Millennia
and there was a great essay written by

6
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:22,470
Timothy leary that I think is fabulous
piece and the sixties called programming

7
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:26,850
the psychedelic experience in which he
defined the psychedelic experience as a

8
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:31,851
period of increased reactivity to
stimuli both from within and from

9
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:34,260
without.
So there's this increased

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,590
suggestibility.
It's almost like we.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,470
We dissolve the boundaries and the
filters that keep us from sort of being

12
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:45,390
flooded by sense impressions and so one
is it kind of delicate suggestible

13
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:47,520
state,
so you wouldn't want to be like driving

14
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:50,340
or having to worry about crossing the
street with a red light or a green light

15
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,060
when you're tripping.

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,170
But the psychotherapeutic use of being
in a state of increased suggestibility

17
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:57,120
is that if you pattern the input
signals,

18
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:59,840
if you sequence and control what you're
subjected to,

19
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,020
subject it to during this period of
heightened sensibility to stimuli.

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,340
You could ski or awareness towards
useful spaces of mind.

21
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,670
You could navigate that evanescent flux
of sensation and perception that Eric

22
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,870
Davis says is all we have and all we are
towards places of ecstatic illumination.

23
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,470
The idea being that you could grab
somebody and give them some high grade

24
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:26,100
medical cannabis and then lead them on a
hike as they listened to the inception

25
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,640
soundtrack and you could kind of curated
awareness.

26
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:33,030
You could steer the emotional direction
that people go to.

27
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,030
We are mediated beings.
We are our thought,

28
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:38,790
our our sense of self is mediated by
language.

29
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,600
It's mediated by environment.
It's mediated by culture and it's

30
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:46,170
mediated by technologies like cinema and
music and so on and so forth.

31
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,750
But we also are thick skinned beings.
You know,

32
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:52,440
a lot of the times we close ourselves.
He a capitation makes us less sensitive

33
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:53,970
to stimuli,
to the mediation.

34
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,410
And so we create higher resolution
technologies,

35
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,680
you know,
four k cameras,

36
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,670
imax movie theaters to create a more
intense mediation that can,

37
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:05,190
that can,
that can scramble our defense mechanisms

38
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,920
and take us towards these useful spaces
of static illumination.

39
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,930
Childlike sense of wonder.
And so on and so forth,

40
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,350
but those external mediation
technologies need to be accompanied by

41
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,620
internal mediation technologies.
That's why turns Mckenna used to say

42
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:18,780
computers are drugs and drugs are
computers,

43
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,610
so we need technologies of inner space
to go along with the technologies of the

44
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:26,970
outer space and the two of them together
I think are pretty cool because they

45
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:31,680
allow us to experiment with awareness,
with consciousness and to kind of script

46
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:33,780
or pattern subjectivity.

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,210
Eric Davis,
one of my favorite writers is the guy

48
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:39,420
who talks about this notion that what
we're dealing with with these new media

49
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:43,140
technologies,
whether they be higher resolution imax

50
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:47,970
screens or psychedelic substances,
is we're trying to engage the technical

51
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:52,971
material of subjectivity itself.
Interiority.

52
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:57,240
We're trying to harness and pattern
interior experience.

53
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,110
We're scripting first person awareness.
It's almost like we become the director

54
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,400
of our own movie from our own Pov and we
get to take it towards the place that we

55
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:08,770
want.
We get to experience the kind of

56
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,790
evanescent sense of sensation that we
want and that that ideas.

57
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,170
I mean,
it's totally out there,

58
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,490
but how cool is it?
It's like,

59
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,171
it's this.
No,

60
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:19,000
it's like,
it reminds me of that movie with Arnold

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,730
Schwartzenegger,
a total recall where you're able to kind

62
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:24,170
of become someone else by implanting
the,

63
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,280
the whole unfolding phenomenological
experience,

64
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,520
and so this notion that we could,
we could basically turn our minds inside

65
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:34,720
out.
You could pattern the human imagination

66
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:39,370
and sort of turn ourselves into anything
we want and experience any possible

67
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,160
experiences.
Just something that sounds,

68
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:44,140
uh,
that sounds amazing to me.
