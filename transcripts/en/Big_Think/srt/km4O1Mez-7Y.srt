The James Beard Foundation is a group of
food professionals who really want to,

2
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,070
um,
foster the community of cooking and food

3
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:23,720
and fine cuisine and to help young
students more than anything else,

4
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,620
get into culinary school and learned the
joys of cooking and,

5
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:30,460
and hopefully make it a profession.
Um,

6
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,870
so that's kind of what it is at it,
at its core.

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,900
It's become a very important group in
the food industry because it,

8
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,450
it annoyance chefs and restaurants
around the country.

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,180
Um,
and every year it gives awards to the

10
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:46,690
best chefs both regionally and then,
um,

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,820
nationwide as well as restaurants and
wine service.

12
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,730
So it's always been a very good
barometer of,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,150
of rising stars and who are kind of the
top of their game.
