1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,670
What was it like growing up in the
Midwest in the 70?

2
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:16,504
[inaudible]

3
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:25,580
I think it was probably more like
growing up in Hawaii or Washington state

4
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:29,750
or Florida in the 70s.
Then it was like growing up in the

5
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:32,810
Midwest and other decades.
I think if it was mostly the seventies

6
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:35,630
and those were the same everywhere,
um,

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,140
maybe we took it a little bit less
ironically.

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,390
Um,
all of that kind of personal growth and

9
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:46,310
self realization stuff.
The seventies,

10
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:50,600
we really bought it again maybe just for
a critical year or 18 months longer.

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,370
But,
um,

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,710
that's enough to kind of set the hook.
I think it's about a prolongation of

13
00:00:57,711 --> 00:00:59,990
innocence of it's a prolongation of
childhood.

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,340
Um,
that's,

15
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,300
that's how I would describe the Midwest.
But there you are just so far from a

16
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:09,110
border or a coast that,
uh,

17
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,840
the possibility of cynicism takes just a
little longer when it hits,

18
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,710
it hits full force cause you'd have to
embrace that cynicism and that irony in

19
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,260
that rage,
uh,

20
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,330
because you've been duped because you
have survived to a greater age with your

21
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:29,090
innocence and that is,
and you feel so betrayed by the world

22
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,770
then that,
um,

23
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,610
the first reaction is to become
unbelievably cynical and hard.

24
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,350
Uh,
but there is that kind of soft caramel

25
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,260
center that never goes away.
Maybe that's just,

26
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:43,970
I'm just generalizing for myself,
but,

27
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,400
uh,
I know that I was an unbelievably

28
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:48,730
innocent 18 year old,
um,

29
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,330
in every way,
but not stupid and not unaware of the

30
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:57,020
world.
But Justin some I somehow still thought

31
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,800
it was a nice world.
Well,

32
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,690
freshman year at college,
basically I went to Philadelphia,

33
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:07,891
um,
oh,

34
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:10,080
it was not Philadelphia's fault.
I love Philly.

35
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,370
Um,
and it wasn't those other kids fault.

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,400
They come from somewhat
tougher east coast schools.

37
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,930
Um,
a lot of private school kids.

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,890
I mean,
wow.

39
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,820
The,
the voltage between their jadedness and

40
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:31,821
my innocence was bound to make one of us
unhappy and it wasn't going to be them.

41
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,290
In some respects,
it's never really been ruined.

42
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,433
Um,

43
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,080
there's something about this whole
narrative that makes me uncomfortable

44
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:46,060
because I really don't truly don't
believe in the midwestern ness of the

45
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:48,070
midwest.
Um,

46
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,730
I cannot get outside it and account for
it.

47
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,890
I believe it exists.
Um,

48
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,930
but it sort of like the center of the
earth.

49
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,793
You know,
I,

50
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,190
I don't actually know for sure that we
have,

51
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,450
uh,
a molten core.

52
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:03,520
I just,
I'm told we do and there's no reason to

53
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:04,161
doubt it.
And they've been,

54
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:06,100
they've been there must be there.
Uh,

55
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:07,840
and the Midwest,
Midwest,

56
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,450
which is kind of the,
the molten core of the country.

57
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:11,360
That must exist too.

58
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,530
Whenever
anyone asks me to generalize about the

59
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,480
Midwest,
I could want to come back and say,

60
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:24,470
there is no such thing as the Midwest.
And every once in a while someone says,

61
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,030
you know,
there's no such thing as the Midwest.

62
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:28,850
And then I want to argue with that
person and say that that's not true.

63
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,790
Have you ever watched a bit western or
get on the subway in New York City?

64
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,940
It was certainly true in my high school
that fashion's got there a year or two

65
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:42,080
later than they did on the coast.
Um,

66
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,560
what we thought was very,
very cutting edge had,

67
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,680
was already passe and in California and
New Jersey,

68
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,210
as I bitterly discovered when I went
east to go to college.

69
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,330
So what that time lag represents?
I'm not sure I just a midwestern values

70
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,650
midwestern values.
I don't think there is such a thing as

71
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,720
midwestern values.
Um,

72
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,200
I mean,
it's kind of the crank capital of North

73
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:14,330
America right now.
That was wonderful,

74
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:17,060
midwestern plain states.
So,

75
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,040
um,
it's not like,

76
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,530
what do you say?
Uh,

77
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,200
it's no different from anywhere else.
Um,

78
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,060
and yet we all feel that there is
something there.
