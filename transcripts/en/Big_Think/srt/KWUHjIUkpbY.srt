1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,360
If you need a little extra energy or you
need to pay really close attention to

2
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:15,210
something today,
here's what you should do.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,060
You should make a prediction about
anything.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,090
It can be a prediction of how many
emails you'll get in the next hour,

5
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:25,290
or it could be a prediction about who's
going to win the baseball game tonight.

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,150
It could be a prediction of how many
jumping jacks can you do with 60

7
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:33,390
seconds.
Make a prediction and then just wait to

8
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:38,391
see if you were right or not.
Every time that you make a prediction,

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
you get a little bump of dopamine in the
reward pathways of your brain.

10
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,840
The reason why you get a little dopamine
bomb is that your brain is preparing

11
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,210
itself to learn.
So we,

12
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:54,900
we often think of dopamine as the reward
neurochemical,

13
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,300
uh,
when there's something we really want,

14
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,120
like,
like a cookie or a pat on the back.

15
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,850
And we get this dopamine hit in
anticipation of it.

16
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:06,050
So we think about it as being really
related to pleasure and,

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,240
and fun and satisfaction.
But the reason why dopamine feels good

18
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,180
is that the brain is actually trying to
trick us into learning or improving our

19
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:21,990
strategies for being successful or
getting what we want.

20
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,920
So dopamine is going to prime your brain
to pay closer attention,

21
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,810
to process information more effectively,
to be more engaged with what's going on.

22
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,310
And uh,
and,

23
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:34,470
and,
and so just make a little prediction

24
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,930
about anything.
You'll get the dopamine hit,

25
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,460
your brain will go into high gear and
you could really use this in,

26
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,630
in very strategic ways.
For example,

27
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:45,930
if you're giving a presentation,
ask your audience at the beginning of

28
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:50,010
your presentation to make a prediction.
It could be about your presentation,

29
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:51,510
it could be about something in their own
lives.

30
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,690
You've given them a dopamine hit.
Now they're paying attention.

31
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,750
They're going to actually learn more
from what you're about to say.

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,230
So make a prediction.
It's a really easy way to get the

33
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:05,310
benefits and the learning benefits
specifically of a dopamine bump.

34
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:07,590
You'll also just feel happier,
which is good too.
