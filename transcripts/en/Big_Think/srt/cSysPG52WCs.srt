1
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,650
Restaurants are overrated.
That's the problem,

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,910
you know,
it's like every restaurant that's,

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,910
that's gotten great.
Uh,

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,110
you know,
uh,

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,290
uh,
a recommendation tends to combat it

6
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:23,110
with,
with a lot of exaggeration that I don't

7
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:24,610
know if that,
is that my fault is that,

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,391
you know,
is that the public,

9
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:27,790
is that the eating public's fault or is
it the media's fault?

10
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,600
I'm not really sure.
But uh,

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,940
yeah,
something going on there where the

12
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:34,180
expectation level is just too high and
it's always going to disappoint,

13
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,690
which is why you know,
you're here nine times out of 10,

14
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:40,720
you here,
I just like going to like the informal

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,381
place,
you know,

16
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:42,161
down the street,
you know,

17
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:45,010
the place that a Mexican burrito and
stuff,

18
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,190
of course you do because your
expectation level is nothing and it's

19
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:50,950
tasty food and it meets the expectation
and it's cheap.

20
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,440
So you know,
and it's fun and informal and like,

21
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:55,180
you know,
it informs you and,

22
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,890
and,
and sustains you in a way that,

23
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,940
you know,
a big fancy restaurant can't.

24
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,840
So I don't know,
I find myself being disappointed going

25
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:02,740
out so often,
but I,

26
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:06,700
I don't know if that's me just expecting
a lot and then falling short or if it's

27
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:07,980
being played up before

28
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,460
I get there.
