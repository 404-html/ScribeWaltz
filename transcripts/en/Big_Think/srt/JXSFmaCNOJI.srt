1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,290
It is in part that and part to mimic
our collective memories.

2
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,330
All of us that,
um,

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,400
memories of strange thing that if you
think about it,

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,300
how much of today do I remember?
Well,

5
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:26,460
I could,
it's already abstracted,

6
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:29,610
but I've already of course,
utterly obliterated almost every

7
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:31,680
syllable to come out of my mouth.
It's gone.

8
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:34,050
It's history.
What about yesterday?

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,020
I can't remember every dish I washed,
every scab I picked,

10
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:41,240
every person I encountered,
it's,

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,480
it's every meal.
I ate hundreds and thousands of them.

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,250
And I would say that out of my life,
99%,

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,300
probably a lot more than that.
It's been a race that is biliterate it

14
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:55,920
erase,
can't remember a detail.

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,380
Uh,
and I'm not just talking about

16
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:01,740
childhood,
I'm talking about a Delta and people

17
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:05,460
I've cared deeply about it.
And I remember them and loving ways and

18
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:08,400
yet have a few snapshots of memory.

19
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,340
And we hold onto those and we call a
memory.

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,390
And that's memory,
that little

21
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,320
remnant of,
of a lifetime.

22
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:23,310
That's what's left to us.
And we attach this word memory to it,

23
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,330
which cylons has a silent of
encompassing all.

24
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:32,310
But it doesn't,
and that certainly applies to the things

25
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:35,580
they carried.
I mean it's a book partly about memory.

26
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,350
The author of that book is an older guy
and he's looking back and he's recycling

27
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:46,521
event from different angles,
sometimes inventing things as a way of

28
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:51,570
seeking that which is,
is gone

29
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,960
ghostly
a good friendship.

30
00:01:57,961 --> 00:02:02,961
Merrick who stepped on a landmine and
was blown into this tree and uh,

31
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:09,051
he's been dead a long time.
And yet in the writing of the things

32
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:11,730
they carried,
I tried to sunway resurrect through

33
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,640
imagination.
What is last thoughts may have been as

34
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:18,420
he sorted into that tree as sunlight is
killing me.

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,730
I know I'm making it up,
but I'm trying to sort of cast a light

36
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:28,731
on that which has been darkened by,
by a history in the passage of time to

37
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,820
let chip keeps soaring.
Hey,

38
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,020
you know,
you said as long as I book is Rad,

39
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,330
that guy's going to keep soaring into
that hedge for you know,

40
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:44,070
and that tree and as long as the book is
Rad Little Linda at the end of the book,

41
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:49,071
is it going to keep skating on that ice?
And Little Timmy will be in love with

42
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:55,581
her and skating along.
And that is what

43
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,621
you don't,
you're not.

44
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:02,770
So I'm not saving their bodies,
and I'm not even saving the memories of

45
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:06,130
these people really.
But I'm saving something like you hope

46
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:10,360
that's essential and enduring,
and the human spirit,

47
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,670
the love of a little boy for a little
girl and a good friend who soared into a

48
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:19,540
tree and a terrible war.
And that's something,

49
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,070
it's not everything,
but it's something.
