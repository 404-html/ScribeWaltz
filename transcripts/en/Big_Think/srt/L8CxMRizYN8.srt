1
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,563
Well,
I mean,

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,500
I think writers,
no matter where you,

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,460
how many places you might settle in
life,

4
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:17,000
you're always only from one place.
And for me that's,

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,380
you know,
working class,

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,240
outer borough,
uh,

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,120
immigrant.
Um,

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,210
I grew up in a housing project so I,
you know,

9
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:29,900
that tends to be home for me when it,
when something sort of piques my

10
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:33,590
interest and makes me want to write,
I always tend to be gravitating back

11
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:35,940
towards that no matter what.
Um,

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,270
and I don't really challenge it anymore,
just go at it.

13
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:39,110
I don't really like,
you know,

14
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:42,460
I'm not going to write it about the
Spanish armada just to show people I'm

15
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:43,340
versatile.
I mean,

16
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,710
you know,
if,

17
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,610
if that's where something's telling me
to go,

18
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:51,611
I just go and I do the best job I can
and hopefully every timeout I'm writing

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,550
a little more nuanced and about the
different facet of life.

20
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,091
But,
you know,

21
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:57,760
a place is just a place,
you know,

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,230
it's what you're,
it's all about the human nature.

23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,270
The only thing anybody ever writes about
his trouble,

24
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,490
you know,
and you can find plenty of trouble.

25
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,160
But by the same token,
look,

26
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:07,850
if,
if,

27
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,520
if I grew up in the Midwest,
I,

28
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:13,100
I'd probably be writing about farms and,
you know,

29
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:14,360
and,
and midwestern life.

30
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:16,130
I was a southerner,
you know,

31
00:01:16,131 --> 00:01:18,350
I'd,
I'd be trying to write like some tea,

32
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,250
you know,
third rate,

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,920
William Faulkner.
If I was from the desert,

34
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:23,870
I'd write like Cormac McCarthy,
you know,

35
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:24,440
you,
you,

36
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,350
you go back,
you,

37
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,590
you,
you hear it calling to your whole life

38
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,180
no matter where you,

39
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,500
you are.
