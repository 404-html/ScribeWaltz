1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:02,523
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,600
I would say the most fascinating part
about saving that really motivates most

3
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:18,160
people and in particular young people,
is this whole notion of compound growth.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,300
Now,
you know,

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,370
we all learned this in our,
in our math classes,

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,860
but what happens is,
is we save a little money and then it

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,000
earns interest or return.
Then our interests in our,

8
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:30,640
in the mount we saved starts to grow
itself and it just keeps snowballing.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,930
In fact,
I'll give you a little,

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,580
um,
a little like sample,

11
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:36,520
which is unrealistic,
but it really shows compound growth.

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,850
If you,
if you had a penny and it doubled every

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,850
day for 30 days,
that penny would grow to over $10

14
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,260
million.
Now certainly we have our money doesn't

15
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:50,590
grow that quickly,
but if you show a young person just

16
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:51,424
even,
you know,

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,850
I'm having an eight to 10% growth rate,
the,

18
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:57,340
the,
the amount of money that you will have

19
00:00:57,341 --> 00:01:01,030
at a later age,
it's really life changing and very

20
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:02,950
motivating.
And so the,

21
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:06,310
I think compound growth is the,
is really the key to that,

22
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,480
which also the other key or motivator is
having options in your life,

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,640
being able to do the things that you
otherwise never,

24
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:13,474
ever could do.

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,413
Okay.

26
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,840
Well that again,
that's this whole concept of,

27
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,590
of compound growth that's you know,
earning interest or,

28
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,310
or having growth on your dollar.
Um,

29
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,190
and,
and so what happens is the growth itself

30
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,310
starts to grow and earn income on it,
on it as well.

31
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,390
So it's just,
again,

32
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:41,830
the snowball effect where it,
it grows and grows and grows really

33
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:44,350
fast,
similar to how that penny grew.

34
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,530
And so,
um,

35
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,410
saving today,
let's you know,

36
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,320
today allows it to grow from war
tomorrow.

37
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,090
Well,
we try to do is get the word out to as

38
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:02,620
many young people as possible.
At Schwab we save,

39
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,660
you were in your teens or in your 20s
save 10% of your income for the rest of

40
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:10,370
your life and you will be financially
secure.

41
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:16,030
But if you wait until your thirties,
you're going to have to save 15 to 20%

42
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:19,280
of your income.
And then in your forties we say,

43
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,500
ouch.
You know,

44
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,350
then you're going to,
I mean,

45
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:24,440
25% of your income,
that's pretty difficult to do.

46
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:29,090
So the sooner you can start,
the easier is on your pocketbook.

47
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:37,480
Yeah.
