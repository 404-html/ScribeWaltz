1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,070
I think firstly we tried to make a
distinction between national culture and

2
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:15,750
company culture.
I mean,

3
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:18,870
when we go to China,
to India,

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,490
to Canada,
to Brazil,

5
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:21,810
to Belgium,
to Germany,

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,210
to Argentina,
of course they,

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,900
each country has different country
culture and that's great.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,930
That's why we travel.
That's why during vacations we tried to

9
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:34,320
go to different places to experience
those difference,

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,900
different cultures.
So that is great.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,170
On the other hand,
what we say is that she wanted to join

12
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:42,540
us.
You have to understand that we are one

13
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,560
company,
one culture.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,280
And when you look at our culture,
it's so much about common sense.

15
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,240
It's so much about what a good athlete
would do to perform.

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,660
It's so much what a good student would
do to perform.

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,360
So it's a performance,
high performance culture that we're

18
00:00:57,361 --> 00:01:00,570
trying to build here.
So I've met people,

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,711
uh,
in,

20
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:03,270
in,
in the last 10 years we've,

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,810
we've been through five or six,
uh,

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,080
business combinations.

23
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,510
And during all those business
combinations,

24
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:13,380
I often ask the question,
what is different between our company

25
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,480
and this company?
We're merging with,

26
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,680
again,
not right or wrong,

27
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,860
but what's different?
And the only thing I could put my

28
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:22,740
fingers on was what we call the dream
people culture.

29
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,820
Uh,
if you have people that aspire to build

30
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:31,821
something that is out of the ordinary,
that's something that's in class that

31
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:36,330
you can be both part of and proud off.
I think that's already a very good

32
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:38,040
start.
If because of that,

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,870
you understand that as a company it can
only be as good as the quality of people

34
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:44,760
in talent,
able to attract,

35
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:45,620
retain,
deploy,

36
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:48,990
develop.
Then you have the people component,

37
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:51,810
which is very important.
You can only be as good as the kind of

38
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:55,260
people and talent you attract.
And then if you have this ownership

39
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:58,200
culture that says that this is our
business,

40
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,890
so therefore we should make decisions
and treated as our own business,

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,870
then you are in a much better place.

42
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,780
I think this is the best kept secret in
our company is a dream people culture.

43
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,510
Because when you look at it,
it's so consents.

44
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,660
It's so obvious.
Most companies would think it goes

45
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:27,120
without saying and they would take it
for granted.

46
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,500
Here at Anheuser Busch Inbev,
we talk about it every day because we

47
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:36,501
think that's really what we stand for,
that so much of what we are as a

48
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:38,250
company,
as a group,

49
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,480
and uh,
uh,

50
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,780
therefore it's worth talking about it
all the time.

51
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,800
So I'll give you an example.
If you don't buy into the dream,

52
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,160
if you don't mind,
to the dream that we're trying to build

53
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:53,370
something out of the ordinary,
something that's best in class,

54
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,350
best of your company,
the better world.

55
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,770
A lot of the targets that we put to our
business on a yearly basis basis don't

56
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:03,910
make sense because they are very tough
targets.

57
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,540
The kids feeling to try it to be best in
what you do good is not good enough.

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,540
So if you don't buy it to that dream in
the first place,

59
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,150
you're going to have a problem accepting
tough targets,

60
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,150
stretch targets.
If you buy into the concept that we're

61
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,100
trying to build something that's best in
class,

62
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,820
then of course we need to have stretch
targets because that's what we need.

63
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,200
Of course,
we need the best people,

64
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,130
not just good or average people.
Of course we need to own this business

65
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,650
because we're proud of it and we're part
of it.

66
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,520
So this whole thing kind of connects all
the dots.

67
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:36,850
And that's why we talk about dream
people culture all the time because

68
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:38,800
that's what,
in our experience,

69
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,520
merging with other companies,
that was the only thing that

70
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:46,450
differentiated performance wise,
our company from other companies.
