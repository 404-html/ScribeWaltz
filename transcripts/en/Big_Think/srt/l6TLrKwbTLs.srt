1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,960
So one explanation that people have
performed over the years for the spooky

2
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:10,170
connections and for quantum mechanics
actually in general,

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,760
is that it's an indication we live in a
multiverse and other words that there

4
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:19,590
are other domains of gals out there that
we have only very dim glimpse of quantum

5
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:22,590
mechanics says that when I measure
particle,

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,540
I get a random result and doesn't have
any explanation for that random result.

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,160
So if I flip a quantum coin,
it comes up heads or tails and I see

8
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:35,370
heads.
Now the strange thing is the mathematics

9
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:39,540
says I should see heads and tails.
So it's always been a mystery of why I

10
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:44,500
see one or the other.
The proposition is that actually that

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,610
the coin does come up,
heads entails,

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,850
but it comes up.
Heads in our universe entails another

13
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,550
universe.
So the idea of different universes of

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,570
parallel universes is a way to make
sense of the multiplicity of outcomes or

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,310
observed in quantum mechanics.

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,060
And people have proposed,
this would be a way to actually kind of

17
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,670
get rid of the non locality that the
nonlocality the spooky action at a

18
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:13,671
distance is actually our kind of
imperfect glimpse of a,

19
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,630
a multiverse of parallel universes and
that individually those universes all

20
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:22,530
behave completely locally,
no spooky action and I kind of actually

21
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:24,000
have a lot of sympathy for that
position.

22
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,780
Actually is kind of awesome to think
that might be parallel universes not

23
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:32,781
just out there but actually in here that
we can be kind of just cheek by jowl

24
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:37,560
with parallel universes all the time.
And we'd never even sent them that eve.

25
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,850
Any measurement we make what caused the
University of branch parallel universes

26
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:46,170
to just be conjured up all the time.
And it's kind of an amazing kind of

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,200
conception of nature.
But I've kind of gone off the idea as

28
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:49,960
much as I kind of.

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,780
I'm drawn to it initially.
And the the reason is that I think that

30
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,950
when you see these spooky actions and
locality in a broader context,

31
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,470
for instance,
in the context of other places where

32
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:03,630
they occur in nature,
not just for the particles,

33
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:06,660
but they also assumed to occur for black
holes that seemed to happen in

34
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,210
cosmology,
they seem to happen in the workings of

35
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:11,460
gravity.
There's a variety of contexts in which

36
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,940
you see spooky actions and those other
contexts are harder to explain in this

37
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:21,360
kind of parallel universe scenario,
but what they really seem to point to is

38
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,260
that space and time are derivative.
The real message of the spooky action is

39
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,340
is that space and time are not
fundamental.

40
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,440
Particles are rooted in that deeper
layer where space and time don't yet

41
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:37,440
exist,
and that's the way to explain them.

42
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,920
So the building blocks of the world may
not be tiny things.

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,470
What could these building blocks be if
they're not tiny?

44
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,950
Because that's kind of what we think of
as a building block of Lego is smaller

45
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:48,510
than the thing you built out of the
Legos.

46
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,350
They may be in what seems to us enormous
things.

47
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,220
Things that spent the entire universe
and they're somehow acting in concert

48
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:59,880
with one another to produce these,
these phenomena of space.
