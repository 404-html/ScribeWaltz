1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,880
Mm,

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,300
curiosity has been often referred to as
closing a knowledge gap and this goes

3
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:14,710
back to Berlin's.
Work,

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,390
goes back to a lot of work being done by
Lippman and his colleagues presently

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,810
would distinguish between two forms of
curiosity,

6
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:26,230
interest,
epistemic curiosity and knowledge gap,

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,230
curiosity,
that probation they call it.

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,300
The reason that they call it deprivation
is because that is has been an argument

9
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:38,200
that if you are curious,
there is a certain kind of negative

10
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:43,201
feeling that you experienced before.
Your curiosity is satisfied and once you

11
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:48,751
have this answer,
you feel a relief and a positive feeling

12
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:54,280
comes over you.
We argued that if you are interested and

13
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:59,281
you are searching for more information,
that is a rewarding experience and you

14
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:04,321
do not necessarily or you're unlikely to
have an adversity feeling except you can

15
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:12,220
have negative feelings develop because
you have a problem in your search,

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,460
but that's different than trying to
close the knowledge gap.

17
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,060
The way that I can best demonstrate you,
how we consider curiosity and interest

18
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,320
to be different is by telling you to
think about when you read a detective

19
00:01:26,321 --> 00:01:28,900
story.
When you read a detective story,

20
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:33,790
the minute you find out that who
actually is the murderer,

21
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,910
you might not even want to finish your
book and compare that to reading glad,

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,870
say Harry Potter or some really well
constructed book that you are not simply

23
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:47,530
trying to find out a knowledge gap.
You are interested in many of the

24
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:49,660
characters who are interested in the
ideas,

25
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,890
you are interested in the relationships
and you will keep on reading that book.

26
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,510
Not only is the length of time different
and the aversion different,

27
00:01:58,511 --> 00:02:03,511
but there are also the purpose is is
different like when you are interested

28
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,470
you,
you are searching for a lot of

29
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:09,430
information,
not just a specific information to close

30
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:10,420
the knowledge gap.

31
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,670
Now there are some
unanswered issues about this.

32
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,740
For example,
what happens if you have interest in a

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,580
content,
but that is a knowledge gap that you're

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,990
closing.
Is that now different from just being

35
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:29,880
curious and we argued that it is because
for example,

36
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,050
at a bridge expert who loves playing
bridge,

37
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,110
he is reading a book with many,
many puzzles.

38
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,240
Okay?
Solving beach hands.

39
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:45,390
He goes and solves and knowledge gap and
then continuous going onto other

40
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:48,550
questions,
other puzzles,

41
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,940
because he has that individual interest
in the content that propels him to go on

42
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,500
for further activity.
