1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,500
I'm often asked and occasionally in an
accusatory way,

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,360
are you atheist?
You know the only [inaudible] I am is a

3
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:10,890
scientist,
right?

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,920
I don't associate with movements,
I don't,

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,190
I'm not in ism.
I just,

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,010
I think for myself,
the moment,

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,040
once someone attaches you to a
philosophy or a movement,

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,620
then they assign all the baggage and all
the rest of the philosophy that goes

9
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:33,420
with it to you.
And when you want to have a

10
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:36,330
conversation,
they will assert that they already know

11
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:39,960
everything important there is to know
about you because of that association.

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,840
And that's not the way to have our
conversation.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,570
I'm sorry it's not.
I'd rather we explore each other's ideas

14
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:53,571
and real time rather than assign a label
to it and assert you know what's going

15
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:58,581
to happen in advance.
So what people are really after is what

16
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:02,040
is my stance on religion or spirituality
or God.

17
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,640
And I would s I would say if I had to
find a word that came closest,

18
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:10,641
it would be a agnostic agnostic.
We're dates from the 19th century Huxley

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,400
to refer to someone who doesn't know,
but it hasn't yet really seen evidence

20
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:24,750
for it.
But it prepared to embrace the evidence

21
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,190
if it's there.
But if it's not,

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,700
it won't be forced to have to think
something that is not otherwise

23
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:31,200
supported.
Okay.

24
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,200
There are many atheists who say,
well,

25
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:37,560
all agnostics or atheists like,
okay,

26
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,310
I'm constantly claimed by atheist.
I find this intriguing.

27
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,970
In fact,
on my Wiki pay,

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,000
I didn't create the Wiki page.
Others did.

29
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,440
And I'm flattered that people cared
enough about my life to assemble it.

30
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,050
And it said,
a Neil,

31
00:01:54,051 --> 00:01:55,250
the recitation is an atheist.
I say,

32
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:56,610
well,
that's not really true.

33
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,590
I said,
let me,

34
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,450
I said,
Neil degrasse Tyson is a agnostic.

35
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,480
Went back a week later,
it had been it,

36
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,630
it said Neil Tyson as an atheist again
within a week.

37
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,871
And I said,
what's,

38
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:10,140
what's up with that?
And I said,

39
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:11,490
I am not the word it a little
differently.

40
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:12,061
So I said,
okay.

41
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:16,230
Neil degrasse Tyson,
widely claimed by atheist is actually an

42
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:18,750
agnostic.
And some will say,

43
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:21,570
well that's,
you're not being fair to the fact that

44
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:22,740
they're actually the same thing.
No,

45
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:23,461
they're not.
The same thing.

46
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:25,500
And I'll tell you why.
Atheist,

47
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:29,500
I know who proudly wear the badge are
active atheist.

48
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,470
They're like in your face atheist and
they want to change policies and they're

49
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,180
there.
They're having debates.

50
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,850
I don't have the time,
the interest,

51
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,710
the energy to do any of that.
I'm a scientist.

52
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,670
I'm an educator.
My goal is to get people thinking

53
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:51,390
straight in the first place.
Just get you to be curious about the

54
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:52,224
natural world.

55
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,050
That's what I'm about.
I'm not about any of the rest of this.

56
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,510
And it's odd that the word atheist even
exists.

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,900
I don't play golf.
Is there a word for non golf players?

58
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,950
Do non golf players gather and,
and,

59
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,850
and,
and strategize.

60
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,020
Do,
do non-skiers have a word and come

61
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:15,100
together and talk about the fact that
they don't ski?

62
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,870
I don't.
I don't,

63
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,740
I can't do that.
I can't gather around and talk about how

64
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:23,380
much everybody in the room doesn't
believe in God.

65
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,260
I just don't,
I don't have the energy for that.

66
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,920
And so I agnostic separates me from the
conduct of atheist,

67
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,560
whether or not this strong overlap
between the two categories,

68
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,950
and at the end of the day,
I'd rather not be any category.

69
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,730
I don't know.
