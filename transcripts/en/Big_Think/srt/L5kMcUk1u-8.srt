1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:08,501
No,
I don't,

2
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:09,940
I don't believe in a class.
I,

3
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:10,571
uh,
you know,

4
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:13,450
I hate to always sound like a middle of
the road or I don't believe in a clash

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,030
of civilization.
I think the other thing that's a helpful

6
00:00:16,031 --> 00:00:17,170
way to look at it,
and I think,

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,270
um,
I think Muslim people or a Muslim people

8
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,470
around the world are probably like
everybody else around the world.

9
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:24,830
And people are more or less the same.
They care about their children.

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,110
They care about the opportunities they
have.

11
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,910
They care about freedom and self
expression.

12
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,080
And when they feel,
uh,

13
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,630
you know,
whether or not their worldview is,

14
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,010
is right,
uh,

15
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:34,671
on this,
you know,

16
00:00:34,671 --> 00:00:37,010
when they feel dictated to are
tyrannized,

17
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:40,550
even if it's the tyranny of a culture,
even if it's the tyranny of Mickey

18
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:40,791
Mouse,
you know,

19
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,380
invading their homes,
uh,

20
00:00:42,381 --> 00:00:43,161
they,
you know,

21
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:43,821
they're,
they're,

22
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:45,380
they're going to stand in opposition.

23
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,300
And I think there's a sizable number of
Muslims,

24
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:50,000
and by no means a majority who,
uh,

25
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,330
you know,
who feel threatened by the,

26
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,680
by,
by America's place in the world and by

27
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:58,550
the export of American culture and the
militarization of their region.

28
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,121
And,
uh,

29
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:01,000
and I don't think that makes it a
civilization class.

30
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:03,740
Cause then that implies that it's a
battle to the death and you can never

31
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:05,720
win people over.
And I think we know that's not true.

32
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:07,850
And I think history tells us that's not
true.

33
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:08,871
Uh,
that,

34
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:11,270
you know,
people make decisions that are best for

35
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:14,390
them and best for their children and
their families and their economic

36
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:16,200
wellbeing and their safety.
Uh,

37
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,180
and if they,
and,

38
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:17,990
and,
and if,

39
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,150
you know,
and they'll change their minds and their

40
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:21,450
worldviews according to that.
Um,

41
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,020
but do I think that it's all overblown?
And that in fact,

42
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:25,660
there is no,
uh,

43
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:27,560
you know,
army of radical Islam that in fact,

44
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:29,510
September 11th was just an isolated
incident.

45
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,700
And as somebody has,
one Democrat recently told me,

46
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:33,950
you know,
if you'd,

47
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,590
if you'd gone to sleep on September
10th,

48
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,341
2001 and woke up,
you know,

49
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:39,260
last week,
you'd think that we'd had 12 cities

50
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:40,940
destroy.
We've completely overreacted.

51
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,080
I don't agree with that.
I think,

52
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,930
I think it's a serious defining threat
for this moment.

53
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,670
I think there are people trying to kill
off.

54
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,800
I think there are many people trying to
kill us.

55
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,810
I don't think this is the red scare.
You know,

56
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:54,440
the John Birch Society and Bob Dylan
singing about looking under his toilet

57
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:55,760
for communism.
And I think this is,

58
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,630
I think this is a,
a and an and a relatively organized and

59
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,420
very dangerous group of people who,
who can and probably will get access to

60
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:08,450
the worst kind of weaponry we know.
And if we didn't,

61
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,050
if we didn't take that seriously as a
foreign policy priority,

62
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:13,640
I think we would not be doing,
you know,

63
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:15,920
we would not be fulfilling our
responsibility to the world.
