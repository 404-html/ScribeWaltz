1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,413
Yeah,

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,110
first off just money and where you know
enough to pay teachers' salaries so that

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,390
low income districts are able to have
adequate education,

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,530
a more financial support,
uh,

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,210
for uh,
for college I did a comparison in

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,770
conscience of a liberal with the,
um,

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,640
with France and we know everybody knows
French do have real problems,

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,700
but everybody knows that young French
are much less likely to be working than

9
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:41,880
young Americans.
A lot of that is actually because the

10
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:45,600
French do things better.
Students are much less likely to be

11
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:48,440
forced to drop out of school for
financial reasons because there are good

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,830
government stipends.
Uh,

13
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,390
students from lower income families are
able to be full time students,

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,240
whereas in the United States they
usually have to work their way through

15
00:00:57,241 --> 00:00:58,890
school.
And this is all good stuff.

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,050
There is a striking,
a statistical comparison I put in the

17
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:09,051
book that if you look at bright students
as measured by tests they took in the

18
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:14,931
eighth grade from low income families,
they're actually less likely to get

19
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:19,920
through college.
Then really not very bright bottom

20
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:22,080
cortel students from high income
families.

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,960
Uh,
we are a society in which the starting

22
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,010
in the wrong class makes it very
difficult to get through college and

23
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,270
that should not be the case.
