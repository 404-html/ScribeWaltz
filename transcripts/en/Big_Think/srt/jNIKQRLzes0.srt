1
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:16,230
I think that that human kind has been a
history of boots,

2
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,840
a powerful people stamping on people's
faces.

3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,300
I think that's history and there's
different size boots and different

4
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:27,080
brands and colors and inside that's
basically history than the enlightenment

5
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:28,940
comes along and they.
Enlightenment says,

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,340
and you know,
it's it.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,670
It's interesting if you read somebody
like Machiavelli,

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,530
uh,
who's,

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,080
whose thoughts about Machiavelli,
but it even have to understand that when

10
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:46,100
they use the word freedom,
they use it differently than we do.

11
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:48,440
For them a,
a,

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,490
a state was free in the sense of it was
not a vassal state,

13
00:00:52,491 --> 00:00:55,310
that prince was not a vassal to some
greater empire.

14
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:57,680
That's what freedom meant.
It was just taken for granted over

15
00:00:57,681 --> 00:01:00,800
there,
and of course the people existed as

16
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,750
instruments of the leaders end.
And then this great watershed moment in

17
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:08,840
humanity is the enlightenment,
especially the Scottish enlightenment

18
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,990
where people started realizing,
wait,

19
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:13,250
we have our own ends.

20
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,250
We exist as ends in ourselves,
and the state is just this compact we

21
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:22,580
form so we can pursue our own ends.
Now,

22
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:24,710
of course,
they control freaks among us,

23
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:29,000
hated that and fought the enlightenment.
Then when they couldn't defeat it,

24
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,400
they subverted it,
and that's the French enlightenment.

25
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,910
That's Russo and they couldn't actually
stop the progress of the enlightenment.

26
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:39,500
So what they did was they cheapen it and
they said,

27
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:39,781
well,
yes,

28
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:41,810
you're right.
This individual freedom is important,

29
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,760
but we have to understand that
individual freedom.

30
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,710
It isn't the silly Scottish English
sense of a man deciding his own ends.

31
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,190
It's really this deeper sense of
subjugating yourself to the right

32
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:56,000
historical mission.
So you get Russo with his love

33
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,670
orientation around the will of the
general will,

34
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,330
which maybe isn't.
It doesn't mean the majority of will.

35
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:06,590
It's maybe something that only one
person knows.

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,500
And when this robespierre forces you to
submit to him,

37
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,390
he's forcing you to be free.

38
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,840
And Russo is phrased.
And then that goes on through Hegel

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,830
Marx,
where the,

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,980
uh,
you know,

41
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,990
it's the trying for the proletariat and
it's Lennon words that vanguard of the

42
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:25,190
proletariat,
the party Hitler,

43
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,670
where it's the,
the,

44
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,320
the folk.
It's the,

45
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:33,321
the prerogative of the people in your
real freedom is frowned and subordinate

46
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:36,650
yourself to the work of the people are
bike Mark Phi,

47
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,070
as they said,
over the concentration camp gates and

48
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:43,580
somewhere along the way,
the intellectuals from the continent,

49
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,640
I think lost the sense of no freedom is
this basic idea of people choosing their

50
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:51,770
own ends in life.
And it's not,

51
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,880
it's,
it's,

52
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,271
uh,
it's,

53
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:55,340
uh,
when I listened to people talk in

54
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,070
politics,
I go right back to this route and it's

55
00:02:58,071 --> 00:03:01,210
pretty easy to say for most of them,
they've just taken the wrong fork.

56
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,500
They are in one way or another,
defining liberty and freedom as

57
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,040
subordinating yourself to the ends that
they,

58
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:13,120
that someone else has chosen for you and
that that's a value less.

59
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,420
That is to me the main contention in the
world of ideas and political thought.

60
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,990
Somebody get that freedom has to be a
self,

61
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,500
a defined process and pursuit.
Or is it,

62
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,470
are they all debating freedom as well?
We take it for granted that we get to

63
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:35,470
subordinate individuals to our ends and
now we're just going to debate the

64
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,313
answer.
That's,

65
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,010
that's where most people are.
That's where most of the world is,

66
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,680
and I think that's a really pernicious
concept.

67
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:46,600
In fact,
voltaire read a book by Rousseau where

68
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,060
he was,
when he read the stuff,

69
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,220
he's,
he wrote us a letter where he said,

70
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,770
dear Mr,
so I've had the pleasure of reading your

71
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:57,490
book against the human race.
Well had it exactly right.

72
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:00,280
This is this philosophy,
this continental philosophy from

73
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,300
Rousseau,
Kant,

74
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,430
Hegel,
a niche,

75
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,060
uh,
a Marx.

76
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,790
Lenin,
of course,

77
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,310
it's,
it's anti freedom.

78
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,930
It's philosophy against the human race.
