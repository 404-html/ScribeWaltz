1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,280
There's quite a lot about the ethics of 
the way they treat non human animals.

2
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:14,640
I say non human,
because of course we are.

3
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:16,990
Animals were not plowed,
so I thought fun guy went up.

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:17,880
Bacteria,
we all,

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,030
we all animals.
Um,

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,470
there is uh,
a double standard,

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,790
uh,
in our ethics of precedent,

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,073
which place,
which builds a wall around our own 

9
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:30,120
species,
Homo Sapiens,

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,763
which is rather odd evolutionary,
or you could think about the fact that 

11
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:34,524
we are close cousins of chimpanzees.
We think about the fact that we are 

12
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:39,054
descended from a common ancestor that 
lived only about six or 7 million years 

13
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:46,590
ago.
If you want to erect a moral wall around

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,420
our species and say,
for example,

15
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:49,254
that a human embryo,
even a very beginning human embryo a 

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,083
long before it develops,
the nervous system is somehow worthy of 

17
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:00,900
moral consideration than an adult 
chimpanzee.

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,190
Then that is a rather evolutionary 
viewpoint.

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,760
If you look back in our ancestry,
at what point would you draw the line?

20
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:09,594
Would you give?
If there were Australopithecus answer's 

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,050
almost certainly our ancestor 
Australopithecus of 3 million years ago.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,393
If you were to meet what if wanted,
survived in the African jungle when you 

23
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:25,980
give it the same moral consideration as,
as the rest of us,

24
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:26,721
or would you say?
No,

25
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:27,554
no,
that's what has the same moral 

26
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:32,840
consideration as a chimpanzee.
Um,

27
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,610
if we look back in history a couple of 
centuries ago,

28
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,670
most people accepted slavery and,
uh,

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,840
nowadays,
of course that's a horrifying thought.

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,750
No,
we don't.

31
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,980
No civilized person today except 
slavery.

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,020
And if you look back further,
still,

33
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:56,580
we had the appalling things that the 
Romans were doing in the coliseum with,

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,440
with spectator sport,
watching people killing other people,

35
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,283
lions,
killing people regarding it as fun 

36
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,610
entertainment to take the children not 
to.

37
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,960
We're certainly getting better as steven
pinker has said in his book,

38
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:10,943
the better angels of our nature and 
Michael Shermer has in his book on the 

39
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:16,160
moral Argh.
Um,

40
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,880
so we're changing a lot and it's there 
for sort of fairly obvious thing to do,

41
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:21,714
to look into the future and say,
what will our future descendants think 

42
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,780
when they look back at us?
The way we look back at our slave owning

43
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,040
ancestors with horror,
what will our descendants will look back

44
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:35,963
on it in our time,
and I think the obvious candidate would 

45
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:42,960
be the way we treat non human animals.
Uh,

46
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,230
my view would be that we want to avoid 
suffering.

47
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,720
Therefore,
the criterion would be,

48
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,280
can this creature suffer?
This is the criteria.

49
00:02:51,281 --> 00:02:55,740
And that Jeremy Bentham,
the great moral philosopher laid out,

50
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,030
uh,
Kevin,

51
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,863
can they suffer?
There's every reason to think that 

52
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,290
mammals,
at least,

53
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,990
uh,
I'm probably many more cans,

54
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,760
can suffer perhaps as much as we can 
pain.

55
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,130
Think about what pain is for 
biologically speaking.

56
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,900
Pain is a warning to the animal.
Doesn't do that.

57
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:17,734
Again,
if the animal does something which is 

58
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:23,881
which results in pain,
that is a kind of ritual death.

59
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:25,930
It's telling the animal.
If you do that again,

60
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:28,060
you might die and you might fail to 
reproduce.

61
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:32,290
That's why not for selection has built 
pain into our nervous system,

62
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:36,600
was built the capacity to feel pain into
our nervous system.

63
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:41,601
So don't mess around with a whole nuts 
because it's painful.

64
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,253
Don't do that again.
Don't pick up burning coals from the 

65
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,340
fire.
Don't do that again.

66
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,170
There's absolutely no reason as far as I
can see why a nonhuman animal,

67
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,800
a dog or a chimpanzee or a cow should be
any less capable of feeling pain than we

68
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,124
can.
When you think of what pain is actually 

69
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,003
doing,
pain feels like something primitive 

70
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:05,854
feels like something like seeing color 
or smelling a rose or something like 

71
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:11,200
that.

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,033
It doesn't feel like the kind of thing 
for which you need intellect and 

73
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:18,160
actually you can go even further than 
that.

74
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,990
You might say,
since pain is there to warn the animal,

75
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:24,400
not to do that.
Again,

76
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,743
an animal which is a slow learner and 
animal which is not particularly 

77
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:33,130
intelligent,
might actually need more intense pain in

78
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:36,490
order to deter it from doing that.
Again,

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
then a human who is intelligent enough 
to learn quickly not to do that again,

80
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:46,510
so it's.
It's even possible that nonhuman animals

81
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,600
are capable of feeling more intense pain
than we are.

82
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,670
I'm not sure how far I want to push that
argument,

83
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:55,504
but I think at least I can say this 
absolutely no reason to suppose that 

84
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:58,744
they feel less pain than we do,
and we should give them the benefit of 

85
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:02,584
the doubt.
