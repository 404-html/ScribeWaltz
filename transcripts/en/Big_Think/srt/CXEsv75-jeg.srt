1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,000
There are several questions,
the essential questions that leaders and

2
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:13,770
managers should ask themselves when they
look at how they want kpis to have an

3
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:16,560
impact and influence on their
organizations.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,870
The most important one is obvious.
What's most important to the

5
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:25,680
organization?
Where is value really created?

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,070
Where is value really created for us
internally and for our clients,

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,320
for our customers,
for our users,

8
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,970
whether they be business or consumers.
Okay.

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,750
How do we want to measure that?
What kind of performance leads to those

10
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:50,781
kinds of outcomes?
The big challenge,

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,590
the difficult challenge.
The challenge that my colleagues and I

12
00:00:55,591 --> 00:01:00,591
and my clients and I and my students and
I debate and argue the most is when our

13
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:06,681
kpis means and when our kpis ends.
Sometimes we want to have key

14
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:12,480
performance because that's what
excellent means.

15
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,510
We're always greeting customers with a
smile.

16
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:17,970
We're always trying to provide the
easiest,

17
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:21,930
most convenient,
the best possible user experience.

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,320
There are other times when the outcome
is really what matters the most,

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,960
which is we get a profit on this.
We get a sale for this,

20
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,710
what our means and ends.
Sometimes the KPI's link,

21
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,420
here's how we've dramatically increased
our sales.

22
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,930
That's fantastic.
Sales Sales Kpi,

23
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:49,230
we've outperformed our sales KPI and
expectation.

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,530
Oh,
three weeks later,

25
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,880
three months later,
the returns for what we've sold are

26
00:01:56,881 --> 00:02:01,881
larger than ever before.
The customer satisfaction scores or the

27
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:05,400
net promoter scores have dropped
precipitously.

28
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,060
Oh my gosh.
We have to manage trade offs between

29
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:14,460
Kpis.
The leadership challenge,

30
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,670
the management challenge is not just how
do we do a better job of identifying,

31
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,790
cultivating,
deploying kpis.

32
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,240
It's how do we identify and manage the
tensions and sometimes conflicts between

33
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:32,250
them.
Again,

34
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,550
that's why this is such a fun subject
because sometimes there can be changes

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,640
where the kpis converge or a new KPI
emerges from your observation of means

36
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:49,044
and ends.

37
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Many stories and anecdotes that can be
told about kpis that really positively

38
00:02:55,561 --> 00:03:00,561
and constructively transform how an
organization behaves and they're also

39
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,000
sadly,
but obviously examples of what one might

40
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:09,001
call pathological kpis.
Kpis that make sense in the moment,

41
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,890
but when you review their ultimate
impact internally and externally,

42
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,930
bad,
bad.

43
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,830
A classic example from 10,
15 years ago,

44
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,070
back when we had call centers instead of
contact centers was time spent on calls

45
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,230
that many call centers were compensated.
The key performance indicator was how do

46
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:39,160
we keep the call down to two minutes,
three minutes,

47
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:44,020
five minutes,
and so throughput calls per hour,

48
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,050
calls per day where the d a dominant Kpi
because that's what productivity was

49
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:52,030
going to be.
What did you end up with?

50
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,660
High throughput,
very unhappy customers.

51
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,990
Even oftentimes if their situation was
resolved because the feedback was I felt

52
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:06,310
rushed,
I felt they were interrupting a lot.

53
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,870
It was a bad ux.
It was a bad customer experience.

54
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,240
There was also emerging at that time the
notion of first touch,

55
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,420
first call resolution,
how can we get things resolved at that

56
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:23,090
time?
Uh,

57
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,650
the first part without making the person
called back or without your calling the

58
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:27,880
back.
Interestingly,

59
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:31,150
if I may digress,
do you know what really transformed that

60
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:36,151
KPI was chat programs?
Because what people could do was they

61
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:37,420
could do a chat to,
hey,

62
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:40,270
I'm having this kind of problem.
What should I do with this person?

63
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,030
And just look,
and they were able to use their

64
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:48,031
colleagues or a database or a Wiki to
get an answer to do first call

65
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:51,610
resolution.
So this ties into the notion of not just

66
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:55,420
a dominant KPI,
but how do we get a productive tension

67
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:59,500
between kpis.
One is time spent on call,

68
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,830
the second is effective resolution,
and the third is customer satisfied.

69
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,770
You're never going to get them all
right,

70
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:11,800
but there's going to be a sweet spot
there.

71
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,200
And in this case,
triangulating those kpis to create a

72
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:22,201
sweet spot was transformative for a lot
of call centers that subsequently became

73
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:24,640
contact centers.
So remember,

74
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,730
if you pick the wrong dominant KPI,
you may end up with perverse outcomes

75
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,010
because you are incenting perverse
behaviors.

76
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,870
If you'll forgive me for making a bad
acronym pun,

77
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:46,530
one of the ways you shock people into
this recognition is that you say Kpi

78
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:50,890
doesn't just stand for key performance
indicator.

79
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,520
It stands for key performance incentive.
So make sure you're recognizing and

80
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:02,600
rewarding the right things,
not things that can lead to perverse or

81
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,430
counterproductive outcomes.
