1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,920
The elements in a great recipe really
very,

2
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:14,430
again,
according to culture and each one will

3
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,770
give you a different answer,
but I think is a,

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,670
again,
the prime product as a chef,

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,770
I need to have the best that I can,
the best that nature can give me in the

6
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:30,270
product,
then my work as the chef is not to alter

7
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:32,130
that have to change,
but to exalt.

8
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,730
So in doing that I may need some
condiments which is olive oil or butter

9
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:40,800
or whatever.
I might need some seasoning to enhance

10
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:43,410
it,
whether it's sold spices or herbs,

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,010
but basically gave me good product from
nature and most of my work.

12
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:53,540
Is that right?
I,

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,760
you know,
it's difficult.

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,940
It's difficult to isolate a.
I think what I would like to say is that

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,850
I love cooking and eating seasonally.
Therefore,

16
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:08,020
following the season,
what does the bounty of the season

17
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,780
brained?
And I enjoy that at the given time.

18
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,550
Uh,
I think,

19
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:13,540
uh,
um,

20
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,910
if you,
if I were to really choose one MSA pasta

21
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:20,380
and vegetables,
that would have to be.
