1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,230
Hiring is as,
as important as any other thing you

2
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:15,480
could possibly do.
And probably if not the hardest,

3
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:17,780
one of the hardest things to do,
you know,

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,240
whether,
you know,

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,500
can you really get the full measure of
somebody's in a,

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,180
I don't care,
six meetings,

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,620
which would be extreme,
right?

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,140
And by the way,
if you get the full measure of that

9
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:30,390
person,
can't you understand how that person

10
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:32,630
will operate within your environment?
Right?

11
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:34,180
Cause just because somebody comes in and
fail,

12
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:38,100
it doesn't mean they're,
they're a failure or a bad executive.

13
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:42,600
It just might be that their personality
or their expertise didn't match,

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,940
uh,
the job of the community you put them

15
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:47,040
into.
So I think it's,

16
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:47,581
you know,
it's very,

17
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,550
very important to do the best he can,
uh,

18
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,340
to recognize the fact that it might not
always work out to be as,

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,310
uh,
as understanding about those times as

20
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:57,930
you are about the times when it does
work out.

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,030
Uh,
and to,

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,470
you know,
nurture your people and train your

23
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:03,090
people as much as you can.
You know,

24
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:05,340
there's been a change and although I
probably a change,

25
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:07,680
again given the recession,
but go into the recession,

26
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:09,210
there was,
there was a change in perception,

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,390
I think about how people graduated
college and came into the workforce.

28
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,220
Uh,
I think,

29
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:15,190
uh,
you know,

30
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,200
some said that they must pant pamper
generation ever that,

31
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,761
you know,
the,

32
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:24,240
the baby boom generation was used to not
having a particularly huge amount of

33
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:28,080
nurturing and you know,
tender loving care and so over,

34
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,450
uh,
compensated for that.

35
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,390
And there are children where the benefit
of that,

36
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,730
so they're probably the most adjusted
generation,

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,190
uh,
and they have a very clear understanding

38
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:43,500
that there's a work life balance,
God forbid.

39
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,600
Uh,
but it,

40
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,630
it makes it more difficult for them on
the one hand to come into a institutions

41
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:55,680
that perhaps don't value that and quite
the same way that they do the other

42
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:56,670
hand,
it makes it very difficult for the

43
00:01:56,671 --> 00:02:01,671
organizations to understand exactly
what's motivating this next generation.

44
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,420
So you've got,
you know,

45
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,020
generational issue intertwined with
everything else that's,

46
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,890
that's gone on in the past.
And so,

47
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,341
you know,
I don't know,

48
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:09,174
there's a,
there's a,

49
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,610
a one silver bolt solution that's
probably not,

50
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,900
but being aware of that and try to
understand that and,

51
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,850
and helping folks on both sides,
uh,

52
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,140
move through that,
uh,

53
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,880
that process,
uh,

54
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:22,290
I think is a,
is is,

55
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,640
is a necessary thing.
You know,

56
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,580
I think there's ways to get people over
that hump that it's not all about,

57
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,190
you know,
everything helping you win

58
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,750
unfortunately,
and get organizations to understand that

59
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,840
there might need to be a little more
helping new people when,

60
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,900
uh,
and once you get past that initial

61
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,190
foray,
you can have some very,

62
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:45,300
very effective,
very good,

63
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,070
uh,
employees.

64
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,730
Yeah.
The other thing I think I,

65
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:55,731
I should mention here is one of the,
the core thoughts that we go into

66
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:58,670
employee interactions with.
Uh,

67
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,170
and that is the notion that,
that nobody is coming to work,

68
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,770
uh,
as at the end has a top of the list.

69
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:09,040
The reason they're going to work is
nothing to do with the level of the

70
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,020
company,
right?

71
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,830
They're going to work because,
you know,

72
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,800
they want to feed themselves and their
families.

73
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,110
Uh,
as the first priority.

74
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,960
The second priority is they're going to
work because they want to improve their

75
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:23,590
career.
They weren't able to feed and clothe and

76
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:26,710
take care of their families better and
better and better as they move along.

77
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,020
You know,
and the third reason they're going to

78
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,270
work is so it's,
they enjoy this better than they enjoy

79
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:32,890
that.
So if I can be,

80
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:36,340
or the company can be the fourth reason,
that's a really good thing.

81
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,300
And understanding that and being up
front about it,

82
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,470
I think is also really good thing.
It allows a more honest set of

83
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:47,980
communications and of course allows you
to have the conversation about,

84
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:48,371
look,
you know,

85
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:52,360
the reason that we all want to succeed
is that by succeeding together,

86
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:56,320
we're all succeed more by succeeding
individually.

87
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,440
We'll all succeed less.
So succeeding together you will a,

88
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,480
make more money.
B,

89
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,360
have,
you know,

90
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,920
a better credential and move forward in
your career with and see,

91
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,560
have a lot more fun.
Uh,

92
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,720
so you know,
all of your three first things will

93
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,370
basically be addressed.
