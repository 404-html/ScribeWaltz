1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,440
Well,
it seems as if there's a really big

2
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:17,460
switch between about five and six.
And of course it's funny because in our

3
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:21,360
culture we say we talk about that age
group is preschoolers versus school aged

4
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:23,340
children.
Of course school is a very recent

5
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:26,010
invention.
But if you look across lots of cultures,

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,870
something happens around you know,
around six.

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,370
So the babies say,
uh,

8
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:37,371
we'll move from the mother's quarters to
the children's quarters or they babies

9
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,320
used to,
uh,

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,720
kids used to start becoming apprentice
being being apprentices when they were

11
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:44,050
about seven.
And you know,

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,210
sort of losing your first tooth seems to
be a big marker of this transition.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,810
And I think what happens is that that
kind of transition,

14
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:52,740
and of course it's,
you know,

15
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:57,000
starting at four or five and then
continuing is really a transition from a

16
00:00:57,001 --> 00:01:01,050
creature that's mostly designed to do
this very broad based learning to a

17
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:04,470
creature that's starting to develop the
specific skills that are going to be

18
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:05,580
important as an adult.

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,620
So by the time you get to a seven,
eight,

20
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:09,690
nine year olds,
they can actually work.

21
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:12,000
I mean they can actually do things that
can actually do things that are

22
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:13,860
productive and helpful.
Um,

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,580
and they're starting to get those
narrow,

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,960
more narrow,
uh,

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,230
maybe I think to say it's not just more
narrow but more specialized.

26
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:25,440
So in some cultures,
our culture really values are very,

27
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:28,380
very narrow focus of attention.
That's what we teach kids to do in

28
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:30,840
school.
In other cultures what they'll do is

29
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:34,380
teach kids to do things like shift
attention from one thing to another very

30
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:35,790
easily.
The,

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,793
yeah.
Um,

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,060
the important thing is that in all
cultures you go from this early very,

33
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:45,180
very wide ranging attention,
which is like infants to,

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,330
and here's the attentional strategy that
is important to do.

35
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:51,630
The things that you need to do in,
in this culture.

36
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:54,690
And sometimes it can be the narrow focus
that we have in,

37
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,120
in our culture,
but other cultures,

38
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:59,490
as I say it might be if you're a hunter
for instance,

39
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:03,420
it might be how to pay attention to lots
of different things at once in order to

40
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:04,410
hunt more effectively.

41
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,710
Show me how they can,
you know,

42
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:11,300
what can we do to make them do it
better?

43
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,820
Um,
and I'm afraid,

44
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:15,590
I think the answer to it is pretty
boring,

45
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:19,910
which is a,
have lots of caregivers around who loved

46
00:02:19,911 --> 00:02:23,990
them a lot and have lots of stuff around
for them to play with and let them play

47
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:27,080
without worrying too much about whether
they're getting academic skills or

48
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,420
they're making a mass.
One of the things I say is from an

49
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:32,960
evolutionary point of view,
probably the ideal rich environment for

50
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:35,090
a baby has,
includes more mud,

51
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:37,760
livestock and relatives than most of us
could tolerate,

52
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,960
uh,
nowadays.

53
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:40,640
But I think,
you know,

54
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:42,310
some pigs,
some,

55
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,500
a lot of dirt and a bunch of uncles and
cousins,

56
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:48,220
that's probably pretty good environment
for babies to grow up and,

57
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:51,740
but if you can't manage that,
then a lot of cardboard boxes,

58
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:53,180
you know,
being plants,

59
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:54,750
goldfish,
um,

60
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,320
the kinds of things you see in fact
sandboxes,

61
00:02:57,321 --> 00:02:58,970
the kind of things you see and really
great.

62
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,750
But I,
you know,

63
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,710
when I say that it sounds very boring
and banal,

64
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,450
but here's,
is one important thing.

65
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,930
We know from the science,
it's the thing that kids learn from most

66
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:12,100
is other people and particularly other
people who are dedicated to taking care

67
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:15,160
of them.
And in most places and times in human

68
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,460
history,
babies have had not just one person,

69
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:22,990
but lots of people around who were
really paying attention to them around

70
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:24,520
dedicated to them,
care to them.

71
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:25,950
We're related to them.
Um,

72
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,190
uh,
and I think the big shift in our culture

73
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,250
is the isolation in which many children
are growing up.

74
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,670
So in fuck,
if we really wanted to make babies

75
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:39,070
smarter,
what we would do is make sure that 20%

76
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:42,520
of them aren't growing up in poverty.
Make sure that even middle class parents

77
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:46,480
aren't so insane because they're working
so hard that they can't spend time with

78
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:48,550
their kids.
Make sure that preschool workers are

79
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:52,480
actually paid more than dog catchers.
So the thing that's most important is

80
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:57,481
having people who are involved and
engaged with the kids and also are not

81
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,960
stressed and can be involved with them.
And that's actually not boring and

82
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:03,730
Banal.
That actually takes a lot of work to

83
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:06,250
make that happen.
And it's not something that our society

84
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:07,084
does very well

85
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,920
[inaudible].
