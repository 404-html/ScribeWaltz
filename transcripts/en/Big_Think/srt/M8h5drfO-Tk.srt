1
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,690
I think the most important technologies
that we have are those that we've had

2
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:17,920
for decades already.
One small example of that would be oral

3
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:21,700
rehydration therapy,
which is a simple solution of sugar,

4
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:22,720
salt,
and water,

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,160
which can save the lives of severely
dehydrated people,

6
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,480
people dehydrated by cholera or a
intestinal worms,

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,250
which has resulted in severe diarrhea.
I've actually seen kids who actually

8
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:38,200
come back from death.
They're,

9
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:42,670
they're literally hours from dying.
You give them the simple solution in the

10
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:46,960
right quantity of oral rehydration
therapy and they're up running around

11
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:50,470
playing soccer.
So why isn't that being used everywhere

12
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:53,470
in the world?
The answer is that the management,

13
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:58,471
the wherewithal and the overall a unity
of focus on public health does not

14
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:03,550
currently exist in so many countries.
Instead,

15
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,920
they might be trying more complex
solutions,

16
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:08,240
sophisticated antibiotics,
uh,

17
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:08,980
other,
uh,

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,960
interventions such as intravenous drips,
which can't be administered in all

19
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:15,180
resource poor settings.

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,570
So it's really a mixed perspective.
I think that there's a lot to be said

21
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:21,270
for new Po,
portable Ekg,

22
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:24,250
akgs,
and also electronic medical records.

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,130
But overall,
I think first we've got to figure out

24
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:31,270
how do we roll out the technologies that
we've got a lot of practice with,

25
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,050
which we know are extremely effective.
And those are technologies like

26
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,380
insecticide treated bed nets or
combination therapy for malaria or

27
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:45,511
antiretroviral therapy for HIV aids.
These are all very basic interventions,

28
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:50,170
which have been with us at least a
decade,

29
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,480
if not decades,
more than that.

30
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,440
And yet they're not currently being
implemented across the board.

31
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,510
There's actually some new vaccines which
have just come to market and are

32
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:04,030
starting to be used in developing
countries,

33
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:09,031
including a vaccine for pneumonia,
pneumococcal vaccine,

34
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,230
which we just piloted in Rwanda.
That's going to save 6,000 lives,

35
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,870
and it's just one shot in the arm that
kids need,

36
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,070
uh,
periodically,

37
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,000
and they're going to be good and it's
going to end up saving more lives than

38
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:23,950
lots of more sophisticated intervention.
