1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,690
Well,
I always stay away from,

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,340
I live in a place which has been cursed
with interference by,

3
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,440
by olders,
we,

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,320
we,
the party that I represent a keep to a

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,181
very,
very,

6
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:28,830
very rigidly neutral lane,
whatever,

7
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:33,831
people to hear a decide in terms of who
your president does,

8
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:38,100
who your congress members is,
what your government does as a modern

9
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:41,100
tardy for people who live here.
From an artist perspective,

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,360
of course we're entitled to say we want
to Ireland to be part of that.

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,720
And given that 46 million or so people
here have their roots in Ireland,

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,970
we think that should be a,
an issue.

13
00:00:56,971 --> 00:01:00,810
And you know,
at some moral at arden does partitioned,

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,153
it's,
it's,

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,340
that's another gentleman and coercion
into our affairs at con be stripped and

16
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:11,850
dogs.
And I'm quite sure that if a future

17
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:15,980
administration decided it was setting
that strategic interest to incorporate

18
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,070
the British government to create
conditions for our issue them to the

19
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:22,620
dump would hop.
And so without getting involved in any

20
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:24,080
of the other,
uh,

21
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,620
issues,
uh,

22
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:28,220
I certainly would,
would argue that it should be a martyr.

23
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:32,010
And incidentally,
it is the most successful foreign policy

24
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,000
position,
uh,

25
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,160
at this time.
I mean,

26
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:40,161
the red is based process in many ways.
A held in its infancy by President

27
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:45,720
Clinton continues to be helped by the
Bush administration.

28
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:46,820
It's,
it's,

29
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,420
it's the success that has worked and it
would not have worked except for Irish

30
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,500
America and for the people who live here
in the U.

31
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:53,820
