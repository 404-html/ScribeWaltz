Daniel,
I'm a professor at the Harvard Graduate

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,593
School of Education.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,420
Well,
the effects of and mixed at best,

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,150
the centerpiece of the administration's
policy was of course no child left

5
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:22,630
behind NCLB,
which had I think,

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,000
a few commendable goals,
one of and,

7
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:27,460
and for that reason,
it was supported by people across the

8
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,500
aisle as well by George Miller,
for instance,

9
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:31,480
on that in the house.
And by Teddy Kennedy,

10
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,480
one of the goals was as George Miller
put it,

11
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:39,481
to shine light in the corners to make it
very hard for schools that did well on

12
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:41,350
average to hide,
uh,

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,280
the,
uh,

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,340
the data if they were doing poorly with
disadvantaged kids.

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,020
So there was a real emphasis in,
in improving and improving equity.

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,180
And the problem is,
in my view,

17
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:55,750
is a very poorly crafted policy is a
real sledgehammer.

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,260
It set a required setting,
arbitrary targets,

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,190
many of which are unreachable by what I
would consider legitimate means.

20
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,610
And it made test scores the end all and
be all of education.

21
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:08,900
It made it impossible or very difficult,
difficult

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,950
for teachers considering anything but
raising scores on tests.
