1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,120
Young person you will find in your life
that sometimes your great ambitions will

2
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:12,321
be momentarily stymied,
forwarded marginalized by those who were

3
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:21,690
perhaps luckier come from money where
more doors opened,

4
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,900
where college was a given.
It was not a student loan.

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,350
It was something that dad paid for.
To wear an ease and confidence in life

6
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,390
was almost a birthright where for you it
was a very hard climb.

7
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,640
Okay?
That happens all the time.

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,990
Some of the greatest Americans,
some of the greatest thinkers,

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,540
artists,
architects,

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,460
politicians and other movers,
shakers and creators all over the world

11
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,790
have come from very meager beginnings
like my favorite American Abraham

12
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,360
Lincoln.
And so just because you come from

13
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:08,100
nothing,
you must not let that be something that

14
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:13,101
holds you back and you will encounter
people who never have to pay in full.

15
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,140
They get to wreck the room and never
have to clean it.

16
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,590
They can get all the way through high
school and never understand where a

17
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:22,020
dollar comes from because they just get
it given to them.

18
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,670
I went to school with guys like that.
You've had presidents like that.

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,050
You've had friends like that and you've,
you've suffered,

20
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,590
your humility has been tried.
Your patients has been tried,

21
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,350
your resolve and your ambition has been
tried.

22
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,830
You cannot let these people make you
feel that you have in any way been

23
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:52,341
dwarfed or outclassed.
You must really go for your own and

24
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:56,070
realize how short life is.
You got what you got,

25
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,670
so you got to make the most of it.
You really can't spend a whole lot of

26
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:03,240
time worrying about his,
you really have to go for your own.

27
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,660
If you have an idea of what you want to
do in your future,

28
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,700
you must go at it with almost monastic
obsession.

29
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,890
Be It music,
the ballet or just a basic degree.

30
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,370
You have to go at it singlemindedly and
let nothing get in your way and that's

31
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:27,420
why you're young.
That's why you can survive on no sleep,

32
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,780
top ramen noodles and dental floss and
still look good and take advantage of

33
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:35,131
that.
Create energy.

34
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:37,230
You have the fact that you can do an all
nighter,

35
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,770
all the people you admire from Muhammad
Ali to any politician,

36
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,510
they work and work and work like Bill
Clinton.

37
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,550
Not everyone's favorite rhodes scholar.
He's smart for a reason.

38
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,340
A got a great gift,
great mind.

39
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,510
But he sat and he shoved a whole bunch
information in there and he learned how

40
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:04,300
to connect the dots.
And so can you,

41
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,020
your president right now is a man who
got where he is through very hard work

42
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,760
and scholarships,
mainly hard work and application and

43
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:19,450
discipline.
If these people can do it,

44
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,960
why not you?
It is very,

45
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:27,430
very easy though to feel smaller,
to feel less than when you see sue,

46
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,490
see people with an advantage
walk where you struggle,

47
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,150
who have ease of motion,
where you are constricted.

48
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,720
It can be a real shot to your morale.
Like it can be flummoxing to a degree

49
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:47,950
where you're almost paralytic.
You got to keep picking yourself up and

50
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:50,770
reaching for it.
And that's the long and short of it.

51
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,680
Cause if you don't,
it won't get done.
