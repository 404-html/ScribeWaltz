1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,730
Yeah,

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,150
no,
I mean it's a company of a,

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,200
of a,
of a famous people have people that want

4
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:23,220
to be famous with blurbs all around it
and it's supposed to be.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,473
And uh,
you know,

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,580
that's supposed to be creativity in
journalism.

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,250
My God,
it's unbelievable.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,690
It's shocking.
I mean,

9
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:34,210
how can happen 200 magazines,
you know,

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,820
do the same cover,
you know,

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,430
that that's always there and advertise
to go home and watch advertise.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,060
I watch the commercials on TV and I
really,

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,130
I'm,
I'm not kidding,

14
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,620
I don't,
I don't really understand what,

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,470
what the hell.
I mean half of them,

16
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:55,840
I don't understand what they're talking
about and,

17
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,550
and most people don't understand,
even if they see something that they

18
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:01,770
kind of enjoy,
they don't remember the name of the

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,813
product,
you know?

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,950
So I mean,
I think,

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,080
uh,
I don't,

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,430
I don't see any,
I mean these people to keep talking

23
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:09,264
about it.

24
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,120
We're on the advent of coming up with
the creative evolution.

25
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:13,140
I don't see it,
you know,

26
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,850
I don't.
At the same time,

27
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:16,750
I know there's got to be talent that
they add on.

28
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,380
I'm not sure who it was telling them
what to do.

29
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,820
Yeah,
you have to have an understanding.

30
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,780
You have to understand,
have an understanding that everything

31
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:30,620
that I go back to what I said before,
everything you do it.

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,780
You have to have a solar farm.
If you come up with an idea,

33
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,180
a big idea it if you,
if you show it to somebody,

34
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,350
your wife,
your friend or a client,

35
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,390
they should go,
holy shit.

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,370
They should your head coach and go back
and forth.

37
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,830
You know,
it should be such and such a surprising

38
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:51,870
idea.
The only chance you have to do anything.

39
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:54,960
That's bullshit.
I has to be a shock when you first see

40
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:55,794
it.

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,240
You know,
and what people do is they,

42
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,293
they,
they,

43
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,330
they,
they just.

44
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,120
So the,
so the work is so unambitious,

45
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,120
you know,
a television commercial is a little

46
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:07,560
films,
you know,

47
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,530
something's going on and you don't know
what's going on and just say,

48
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:13,830
well what is it about?
And then you're looking for who the

49
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:16,110
client is.
And then when you see it you say,

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,790
oh,
I don't get it.

51
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,520
No,
I'm sorry,

52
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,240
I tried to.
It's a wasteland of a creativity,

53
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:26,210
unfortunately,
and I can't believe they're hidden

54
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,180
talent that day because I know I pay
people.

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,020
I have fans who profess your love of my
work,

56
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:34,854
et Cetera,
et Cetera,

57
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,660
to kind of be something you to learn
from it.

58
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,820
I went,
they got to be learning from it is that

59
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,880
when you do something,
it should be an issue.

60
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,810
We had not got idea,
you know,

61
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,330
and,
and in most cases,

62
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,810
certainly in
certainly in an editorial and in which I

63
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:56,800
already did for 10 years for it,
for esquire and I and now in the museum

64
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,780
or not,
but,

65
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,643
but,
uh,

66
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,520
but you have to eat when you're.

67
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,840
Every cover is when it hit,
when it was on a newsstand.

68
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,830
Peep some people.
What?

69
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,040
I mean,
the culture went ape shit on some of

70
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:10,990
them.
They looked at anybody.

71
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,750
Well,
um,

72
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,880
um,
you know,

73
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:17,930
go to a new standard today.
You

74
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,500
never forget about something being
culturally being a culture busta.

75
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,130
There's nothing there that you could
possibly remember.

76
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,810
There's an ad today and about hearst
there today,

77
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,410
but with three magazines I talk about
they're getting awards,

78
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,290
etc. Etc.
And you look at thE cupboards and uh,

79
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,860
uh,
I don't know nothing,

80
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,400
you know,
they're all the same cover,

81
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,273
you know?

82
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:46,923
Well,
that's the,

83
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,700
that's the big problem,
you know,

84
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,610
I mean,
I'm talking about people or about a

85
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,510
young designers not,
not being ambitious enough,

86
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:56,141
et cetera,
et cetera.

87
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:58,810
One of the problems is,
is that,

88
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,130
you know,
certainly in,

89
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,310
in magazine design,
there's a lot of terrific talent,

90
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,630
uh,
doing editorial.

91
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,150
I meAn,
when you get this society publication

92
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:09,960
designer sends,
there were awards every year ago,

93
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:10,794
a book,
you know,

94
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,150
and uh,
and you'll look through it and it's a

95
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:16,330
lot of terrific threads in it,
a lot of exciting stuff going on.

96
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:18,370
You know,
there's talent there and then they show

97
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:20,990
the best coverage of the year.
And then at the end,

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,760
nothing,
you know.
