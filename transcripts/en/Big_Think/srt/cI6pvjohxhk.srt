1
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:13,110
The most prominent conspiracy theory was
coming from a pan down insurance,

2
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:17,110
a insurance company investigation that
was ran by a guy called

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,800
who pretend to be an officer,
a code named abner that wrote the book

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,640
vengeance.
That was the basis for the Spielberg

5
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,800
movie,
Munich Olympic massacre.

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,210
Everything that he wrote is false.
I saw and I had numerous meetings and

7
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:43,241
conversations with him every time that
we reached a point where he was supposed

8
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:48,761
to give me the smoking gun,
one conclusive evidence that proves a

9
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,630
that it wasn't
that it was Iran sending the Pfl G,

10
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,250
I'm a organization to take revenge for
taking off the Uranian Airbus aircraft

11
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:08,411
by the U.
S Vincent's a ship by Mr and that the

12
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:14,561
CIA had a unit called Korea that was
involved in taking out a Pan Am 103 for

13
00:01:17,631 --> 00:01:20,420
their reasons.
Every time that we reach that smoking

14
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:21,320
gun.
He said,

15
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:21,590
no,
no,

16
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,900
it's in a safe in Europe.
I will just about.

17
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:27,320
I'm going to give it to you tomorrow.
It will take me few more hours.

18
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,860
I never saw any real conclusive evidence
that connects Iran to this case or this

19
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:37,970
connected Libyans and at the end of the
day,

20
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,400
while my Kadafi paid compensations,
so I don't know from his point of view

21
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,550
why I gave the person involved to a
trump,

22
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:52,270
why would he,
why would he pay con conference con?

23
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,980
Why would he pay any money
for something that he didn't do?

24
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,400
A very positive example and very
negative example to negotiating on

25
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:14,520
nuclear issues.
The very positive as Libya,

26
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,950
the mic and CIA got involved with the
son of Kadafi who convinced this father,

27
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,990
who used to be considered the most crazy
of all Middle East leaders to compromise

28
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,290
and to give up everything for western
support.

29
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,390
This is very positive and they complied
with all promises that they gave and

30
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:37,310
disassembled the whole of their nuclear
project.

31
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,310
The negative example with be,
of course,

32
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:45,311
North Korea that sign a sort of a deal
with President Clinton just to stall

33
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:50,450
time and have more nuclear advancement
that lead them to a bomb.

34
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,770
Now,
the lesson would be I think that the US

35
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:58,310
should deal or should negotiate with
Iran if the Iranians are willing to

36
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,950
negotiate,
the US cannot afford to refused

37
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:07,951
negotiation with what I see as the worst
security challenge the US is facing.

38
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:12,680
And this is Iran.
If Iranians are willing to negotiate,

39
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,350
the US should deal with them without
preconditions.

40
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,450
I know that general,
uh,

41
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,500
Senator John Mccain,
he preaches for preconditions.

42
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:25,310
I don't support this view.
I think that the US should go to the

43
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,760
negotiation table,
but just making sure that Iran is not

44
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:31,160
just doing it as he did to your to gain
time.

45
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,420
If Iran is willing to negotiate the,
uh,

46
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,460
stopping the enrichment of uranium
cutting relations with Iraqian Afghany,

47
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,190
insurgencies stopping a to Hamas

48
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,850
and,
uh,

49
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,570
stopping promoting his butler.
I,

50
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,090
I think that this would be great.
This would be a major solution and a

51
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:56,540
peaceful solution.
And maybe the last chance before,

52
00:03:56,541 --> 00:04:01,541
before a striking Iran,
I would gloomily globally a suspect that

53
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,060
the Iranians will not give all this
which they deem is a very interesting,

54
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,910
very important interest.
And at the end of the day,

55
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,880
a much more harsh action would be taking
place.
