1
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,730
Intrepreneurship is about solving
problem,

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,623
about,
uh,

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,570
uh,
addressing the issues of the world

4
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:19,110
around yourself is not just making
money.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,140
That's what I meant by entrepreneurship.
And entrepreneurship is something that

6
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:27,450
we carry with us as a human being.
We came in this planet,

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,910
uh,
to solve problems.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,500
We solve problems all around us and we
continue to solve that problem.

9
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,680
And that's how we survived.
Uh,

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,830
we were in adverse circumstances when he
came to this planet,

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,970
but we will not frightened by that
adverse circumstances.

12
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:49,971
We took them back grip and one by one we
tried to solve them and we kept on a

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,470
solid with them.
As a result,

14
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:56,190
we came millions of years on this planet
and survived and successful.

15
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,970
So there's entrepreneurship.
I any,

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,070
any human capability used for solving
problem for mankind,

17
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,680
for the planet.
Uh,

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,770
I would consider this an intervention.

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:13,790
Yeah.
