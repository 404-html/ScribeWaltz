1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,450
Um,
I think it may have something to do with

2
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:14,280
the
myths of the gala to at least the ideal

3
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:17,140
of Galitary aneurysm,
um,

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,540
that,
uh,

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,080
it's better to be a regular guy.
I'm with sort of good standing in the

6
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:28,170
community,
good character and so on than to be a,

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,000
an egghead eggheads,
uh,

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,230
a suspected.
And that's not just American culture.

9
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:36,600
I think that's,
that was true traditionally in,

10
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,000
in,
in Britain as well.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,900
And there's something to be said for it.
I mean,

12
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,730
there are,
there many unpleasant,

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,150
uh,
effects of,

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,050
of that kind of fillets,
Philistinism.

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,440
But the good thing is that ideas can be
dangerous.

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,260
Intellectuals are dangerous where you
give them too much power because they

17
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:58,730
tend to take ideas to their extreme and
uh,

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,780
they're not practical people in the
whole.

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,730
Um,
and it's good,

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,270
I think to be a little suspicious of
taking idea,

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,650
any idea to its extreme and it's
probably better to have people in power

22
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,490
who are more practical and who can,
who know the art of compromise.

23
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,330
Well,
I think he would be,

24
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,220
on the one hand,
probably a shocked because some of his,

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,410
um,
possibly some of his is worse,

26
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:34,730
his most pessimistic predictions would
seem to have come true and that he,

27
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:35,970
he,
he,

28
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,400
he was on the one hand in favor of
democracy and he admired American

29
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,530
democracy,
but he was frightened of the possible

30
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:44,900
consequences.
He thought it could lead to tremendous

31
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:48,110
vulgarity and so on.
And I think he probably would see that

32
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:53,470
and you would also see a much less a
conformist population probably than the

33
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:59,780
one he saw,
depending on where he would travel,

34
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:01,430
of course.
Um,

35
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,600
and I think he probably would be rather
shocked by the tone of the public

36
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:13,421
figures of the politicians who are
probably less little less high minded

37
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:16,010
than the ones that he encountered when
he was there.
