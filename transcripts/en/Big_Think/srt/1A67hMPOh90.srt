1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,450
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,513
no,
not at all.

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,950
I think a lot of people don't understand
this at all.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,383
First of all,
understand that in the state of New 

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,503
York,
there has been very active conservative 

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,400
party for decades,
uh,

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,960
elected Senator Buckley in the 
seventies.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,690
And if you look at the history of 
congressional races in New York,

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,700
probably a lot of other races I've seen 
through congressional races,

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,100
the Conservative Party oftentimes 
nominates a person historically,

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,113
they've been the good sports that have 
been willing to step back and throw 

12
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:44,474
their support to the Republicans in the 
interest of stopping a more Liberal 

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,760
Democrat from getting in office.
Now,

14
00:00:49,761 --> 00:00:50,594
what happened in New York,
23rd was a handful of people got into a 

15
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:01,541
back room and nominated a democrat.
And the first thing we heard,

16
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:06,950
for example in my shop at freedom works 
was from our grassroots activists in the

17
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:08,450
north country of New York.
They said,

18
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,750
the Republicans have just lost this 
race.

19
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,500
Uh,
this woman can't possibly win this race.

20
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:18,290
She would not ever want a republican 
primary.

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,800
She was too liberal.
If there's no way she would have won the

22
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:24,110
Republican primary.
So.

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,870
So what happened was the conservative 
party said,

24
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:27,704
oh my gosh,
the Republicans are about to lose his 

25
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:31,370
race,
uh,

26
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:32,204
and they feel that their candidate.
So what happened was there were three 

27
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:36,224
candidates from three different parties 
in the race to liberals in the 

28
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:43,190
Republican and Democrat nominees,
and one conservative,

29
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,020
the conservative candidate,
although he was a first time candidate,

30
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,760
a quite naive and innocent in the ways 
of politics.

31
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,270
He,
he grew so fast in his standing with the

32
00:01:56,271 --> 00:02:00,650
electorate that she got knocked out of 
the race when she got knocked out of the

33
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:01,700
race.
What did she do?

34
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:06,701
She made a deal with the White House and
Chuck Schumer and endorsed a Democrat.

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,490
So what did I say?

36
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,343
First validation.
I see aneurysm are grassroots activists 

37
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:13,580
called that correctly,
didn't they?

38
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:14,450
They did.
In fact,

39
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:19,040
nominated Democrats and the Conservative
Party failed to win that election.

40
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,173
Now,
this is a short term victory for the 

41
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:22,934
Republicans.
They can celebrate it all they want 

42
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,540
because a year from now,
they're,

43
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,443
the Democrats will lose that seat 
because the Republicans will have an 

44
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,183
open primary.
They'll nominate a conservative 

45
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:38,660
Republican or at least a middle of the 
road Republican,

46
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,710
and that person will win the race back 
from the Democrats so that Democrat will

47
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:46,490
only sit in that office for about a year
and when that happens,

48
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:47,324
the Conservative Party will once again 
play their role of being in support of 

49
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,304
their principals and working the 
republican nominee a little bit more to 

50
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,020
their perspective on public and,
and then helping him beat the Democrat.

51
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,150
Social issues were so much.
So I was up there.

52
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,350
I mean socialists were just simply not 
part of the debate in that race.

53
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,813
The Democrat candidate,
when it was just the two of them and 

54
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:20,160
erase the Democrat,
was running a gastro as a big spender.

55
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,330
And so her,
her first dress Greshon,

56
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:27,210
whereas she was four,
she was four big budgets.

57
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,750
She was for cap and trade.
She was for a card check.

58
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,650
The Mandatory Union plan that denied 
workers' a secret ballad.

59
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,580
Uh,
so she,

60
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,330
she took on economic issues,
eras and I,

61
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,170
I saw no discussion of social issues in 
that race on economic issues.

62
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,333
She was so liberal that even the 
Democrat was running against her for 

63
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:54,654
being too liberal at some point.
Everybody who are seeking office or 

64
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:03,734
wanting to hold office at some point 
they have to respond to the voting 

65
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:09,860
constituency whose votes they want.

66
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,130
And right now the Republicans are in 
office,

67
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:16,640
are kind of confused about that.
This,

68
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,533
this tea party movement,
which is what you see right now is most 

69
00:04:20,241 --> 00:04:21,074
visible and grassroots conservativism is
a thousand points of entrepreneurial 

70
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:27,570
light into it.
In,

71
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,280
in a,
uh,

72
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,490
advocate,
advocating small government,

73
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:33,770
conservative Islam just popped up all 
over the country.

74
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,870
Uh,
and it is genuine.

75
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,580
He largest grassroots movement I've ever
seen on a,

76
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:43,760
on particularly the economic issues.
The office holders are start,

77
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:44,660
oh,
I get it.

78
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:45,843
If I want to be reelected,
I better be responsive to what these 

79
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:50,960
guys are telling me.
That's where all the energy,

80
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:55,790
there is no greater source of energy in 
public policy,

81
00:04:55,791 --> 00:05:00,260
discourse and politics today.
Then the small government conservative.

82
00:05:00,261 --> 00:05:01,094
So the,
the Orthodox Republican Party is 

83
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:04,214
dispirited and confused and going 
through a massive identity crisis where 

84
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,620
they're trying to.
Jay Basically ask the question is,

85
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:11,454
who are we and what are we doing here?
The Democrats are inflicted with 

86
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,170
probably the most severe case of buyer's
remorse they ever had,

87
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,970
even worse than with the Clintons and 93
and 94 a day,

88
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,550
they have no energy to bring to the 
field,

89
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,230
so the field is right now dominated by 
the extremely big tent.

90
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,310
I was small government conservativism,
which has Democrats,

91
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:36,110
Republicans,
independents,

92
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,720
Libertarians,
evangelicals,

93
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:43,160
people of all stripes and color,
and I'm religious orientation,

94
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,473
and they're all happily joined in 
resistance to a growth in the power of 

95
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:52,730
the state that they find frightening for
their personal liberty.
