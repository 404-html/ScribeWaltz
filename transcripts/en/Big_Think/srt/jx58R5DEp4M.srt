1
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,160
I'm against regulations,
so,

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,720
so,
uh,

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,530
now,
uh,

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,800
yeah,
I think that as long as we find a way to

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,030
control,
uh,

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,953
the,
uh,

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,033
the,
uh,

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,920
the flow of money that goes,
that would go to a,

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,720
to uh,
ill conceived initiatives and obviously

10
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:37,520
you have to think about terrorism at
this point.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,110
Uh,
that's legitimate that we have

12
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:44,510
mechanisms to make sure that,
uh,

13
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:49,810
that we have a way to track illicit or
movements or suspicious movement of

14
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:56,030
money.
So this delicate balance here and this

15
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:59,810
is being done as we speak.
I mean probably more than we know or

16
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:01,950
care to know.
Uh,

17
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:07,450
but other than that I think to regulate
in the business sense of the word,

18
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,630
I think that game,
that would be a mistake because I

19
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:16,870
obviously a convinced a capitalist
not because it's the parent because it's

20
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:21,420
been a CEO,
not because it's,

21
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,550
it doesn't have any drawbacks,
but frankly we haven't found anything

22
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:28,350
better.
So to,

23
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,350
to,
to,

24
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,560
to rise,
you know,

25
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:33,300
to raise the,
the level of the one.

26
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,550
So the road,
the road to progress up to now is

27
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:42,220
through a capitalistic system.
If we could find something better,

28
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,290
I'm wide open to it,
I'm open to it,

29
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,340
but we have not.
So,

30
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:52,090
and the essence of the capitalist system
is that you don't want to regulate it or

31
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:55,890
at least you certainly want to do the
minimum to make sure that there's order

32
00:01:55,891 --> 00:02:00,891
is preserved and that again,
no illegal or illicit a things are being

33
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:03,104
done.

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,060
Huge change.

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,620
Um,
you know,

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,330
globalization has an,
some well known,

37
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,210
uh,
I wouldn't say he shares but well known

38
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:22,410
statements on this,
you know,

39
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:24,540
the world's flat.
And so,

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,680
which is true,
I mean,

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,260
to some extent,
to some extent,

42
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:31,320
it's true that the globalization has,
as we have moved for me,

43
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,240
national markets through a global
market.

44
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,830
So now people think they can play
anywhere everywhere in the world and

45
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:41,820
they are.
And this has created a situation where

46
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:46,120
large global company fairly acquired a,
a

47
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,950
or power,
uh,

48
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,920
that is very,
very significant.

49
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:57,240
Some of them have the citizenship to
deal with this,

50
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:02,110
the corporate values to deal with it.
Some of them may not yet,

51
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,880
but,
but they are getting there quickly

52
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,300
because they realize their
responsibility on,

53
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,050
in the world because of their presence.
Uh,

54
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,070
and uh,
to some extent that has a,

55
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,610
raised the awareness amongst the ceos of
large global companies that global

56
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,970
corporate citizenship is very important
and they have to deal with that and they

57
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:29,170
are,
and they are,

58
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,230
which is also one of the reasons they're
form is successful at attracting this

59
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,440
interest because that's when we talk
about that.

60
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,210
So,
uh,

61
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,220
so that's one thing.
The second thing is that

62
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,050
countries have sort of lost a fair
amount of power in this globalization

63
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,130
evolution,
uh,

64
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,000
and uh,
uh,

65
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,880
because of this goes across nations.
So this is,

66
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,380
this is a change that's interesting to,
to witness

67
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,090
and uh,
some countries react a smartly to this

68
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,620
and some not so smartly,
so,

69
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,800
uh,
but progressively inevitably,

70
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,070
uh,
this is going to go into the right

71
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:25,071
direction because business is getting
conscious of their responsibilities and

72
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:29,820
governance are starting to our
understanding how they can really deal

73
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:34,821
with this phenomenon more,
more effectively as an opportunity

74
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,160
rather than a threat.
Here's the big difference,

75
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,000
of course,
countries have gone to protectionist

76
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:44,040
measures.
Uh,

77
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,400
I've tried to,
uh,

78
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:50,190
contain a,
they are industry by artificial means

79
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,060
and that's not,
that's not the solution.

80
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:58,440
The solution is to not to look at this
as a threat,

81
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,920
but to look at it as an opportunity and
those who do

82
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,440
pa successful,

83
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,160
okay

84
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,020
at this point are saying that,
hey,

85
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,490
we can argue whether we will or will
not.

86
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,770
And to what extent we have recession,
putting her name on the economic

87
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:25,300
slowdown is always sort of artificial.
Here we started session is two quarters

88
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:26,470
of negative growth.
Okay.

89
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:29,590
So that's an arbitrary decision,
but so be it.

90
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:32,560
If that's the decision,
I don't know whether it will have that.

91
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,210
Maybe we do,
maybe we don't.

92
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:36,160
I think it's a material to a large
extent.

93
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:41,161
We will come out of this and grow again.
So it's only a temporary situation.

94
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,980
Now I've saved this.
Even if we have this,

95
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,160
uh,
the engines of growth in the rest of the

96
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:53,161
world are powerful enough that I don't
think this will trigger will recession

97
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,010
at all.
Uh,

98
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,530
because the,
uh,

99
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,890
there was Korean economies are just
unbelievable and uh,

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,290
if China grows at 10 percent a year or
nine percent a year,

101
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,880
if just started grant six percent a
year,

102
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:11,270
I mean,
this is still a lot of growth.

103
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,830
So,
uh,

104
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,200
so I don't see,
I don't see that as a problem at all.

105
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,600
I think
the purchasing power of Americans is

106
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,830
decreasing and will continue to
decrease.

107
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,430
I think this is inevitable as a result
of this global trend.

108
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,750
Uh,
so,

109
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,950
so some of the other countries are
raising to that level,

110
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:46,460
coming to that level.
I think,

111
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:49,880
as I said earlier,
the bigger problem is the income

112
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:53,240
disparity between Africa and the rest of
the world.

113
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,390
I think this is,
this,

114
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,400
this property did a more serious issue
on that particular question that in my

115
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:02,481
view,
we have.

116
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:04,240
Yeah.
