1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,240
Laser cooling means shining light on
stuff and making it cold.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,020
Now that in itself sounds like it's
completely backwards because after all,

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,570
you typically think if you shine light
on something,

4
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:16,620
it's gonna.
Get warm,

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,270
so how is it even possible to shine
light on something and make it cold to

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:25,950
cool the air down means to make those
molecules,

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,210
atoms in the air move more slowly.
That's the difference between hot and

8
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:33,850
cold.
So how do you make something cold with

9
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:34,710
the laser?
Well,

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,280
lasers,
all light pushes on stuff.

11
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:40,200
There's a thing called radiation
pressure.

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,000
White pushes on things.
What we've figured out to do over the

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
years is how to push on Adams in such a
way as to make them slow down.

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,670
The thing that was perhaps the.
The crowning achievement of the early

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,020
days of laser cooling was the discovery
that we made in our laboratory that it

16
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:09,021
was possible to get these atoms colder
than everyone had thought was the limit

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,190
to how cold you could get something.
The prediction said that we could get

18
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:19,191
down to temperatures of 240 millions of
a degree.

19
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:24,630
In other words,
one quarter of 1000 of a degree above

20
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:26,220
absolute zero,
pretty cold,

21
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,660
right?
Will in fact,

22
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,400
we've got a whole lot colder than that.
And that was the big breakthrough

23
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:34,650
discovery that made a whole lot of other
things possible.

24
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,860
Well,
all clocks have tickers.

25
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,220
All of these tickers have imperfections.
Every quartz crystal is made a little

26
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:50,910
bit differently of the length of the
pendulum can change a little bit on that

27
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,400
changes how fast it will swing back and
forth.

28
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,200
So all of these clocks have
imperfections and so one has throughout

29
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:03,201
history been trying to make these clocks
better by making the tickers be more

30
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,620
reliable.
That is always had the same.

31
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:09,000
Taking frequency.
Well,

32
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:14,001
it turns out that atoms are the best
choice for making tickers that always

33
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:16,970
take at the same frequency even Adams
have there,

34
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,220
uh,
um,

35
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,370
uh,
imperfections.

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,870
Temperature means that the atoms are
moving with a certain velocity,

37
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,500
having a certain kinetic energy.
The hotter the gas is,

38
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,140
the faster the atoms are moving.
It's not so easy to measure the ticking

39
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,780
frequency of something that's whizzing
around at the speed of sound.

40
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,000
And that's the problem that everybody
was facing with atomic clocks was the

41
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:45,630
Adams are moving at approximately the
speed of sound and it wasn't so easy to

42
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:47,940
measure the taking frequency.
So we said,

43
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,010
let's call them down using lasers.
So they're going more slowly and that'll

44
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:55,950
make it easier to measure the taking
frequency and you can make better

45
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:59,230
clocks.
When I started doing laser cooling,

46
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,150
the very best clocks were accurate to a
part in 10 to the 13th.

47
00:03:03,151 --> 00:03:06,850
So that's one part divided by one with
13 zero,

48
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:10,030
zero effort.
That's the fractional error in how good

49
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:11,650
that clock was.
Sounds incredible,

50
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:16,651
right?
But today those clocks are a couple

51
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:17,950
intended,
the 16,

52
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,370
almost three orders of magnitude better.
And that has been made possible because

53
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,280
of laser cooling,
I suppose that young children are

54
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,900
curious about everything.
And very early,

55
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:40,100
my curiosity tended toward a curiosity
about science.

56
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,490
My parents got me a microscope when I
was very young,

57
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:47,390
maybe six years old.
And I remember looking at all kinds of

58
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:49,370
things around the house,
uh,

59
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,460
with this microscope.
I remember collecting various household,

60
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,640
uh,
uh,

61
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:00,190
chemicals and fluids to mix together,
which was my homemade chemistry set,

62
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,470
and in addition,
I was doing all the other things that

63
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:05,880
kids do,
climb trees and uh,

64
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,400
uh,
a scary up and down a cliffs and a

65
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,320
clicked a huckleberries in the woods.
Uh,

66
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,154
but,
um,

67
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,900
uh,
there was always a lot of physical

68
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:21,590
activity and a lot of that physical
activity for me involved,

69
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,850
uh,
doing things that,

70
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:25,040
uh,
that related to science,

71
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,780
looking at stuff,
being curious,

72
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,610
curious about the natural world.

73
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,580
That's a really interesting question.
Um,

74
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,110
and um,
sadly the answer isn't simple.

75
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,300
The simple answer is no,
but now I've got to explain why I'm

76
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:48,301
saying that the answer is no.
The answer is that every process for

77
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:53,521
cooling either also introduces the
possibility that you can introduce some

78
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:58,360
extra energy into the system.
You see,

79
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:02,290
cooling means taking energy out and
heating means putting energy in.

80
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,640
But in order to take energy out,
then it turns out that you opened the

81
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,340
door for energy to go in,
take laser cooling.

82
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,270
Laser cooling takes the energy out by
having an Adam coming along.

83
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,470
And then a photon hits the atom and
slows the Adam down.

84
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,360
Then that photon has to go someplace and
when that photon is shot out by the

85
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:25,180
atom,
the atom recoils and more energy goes

86
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:27,640
in.
So there's a balance between the cooling

87
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:32,290
and the heating and you can try to make
that balance work more and more in your

88
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,150
favor,
but you can never make it work.

89
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,040
One hundred percent cooling and no
heating.

90
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,150
So that's one of the reasons why you
don't expect to ever get to absolute

91
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:42,370
zero.
On the other hand,

92
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,200
what does it mean to be an absolute
zero?

93
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:46,750
It means that all the thermal motion
stops.

94
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,390
Well,
I can take one,

95
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:54,391
Adam and I can take as much energy out
of it as possible so that it's in what

96
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:00,950
we would call the ground state.
The lowest possible state of energy.

97
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,220
Is it absolute zero?
Not really,

98
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,670
because in order to be at absolute zero,
I really have to have a whole bundle of

99
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:09,680
things.
I can't really talk easily about the

100
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:13,760
temperature of a single object.
I should really talk about a whole

101
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:17,420
ensemble and if I do that with a whole
bunch of atoms,

102
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,940
what's going to happen is maybe if I'm
lucky,

103
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:23,450
maybe 99 percent of them are going to be
in the ground state and then one percent

104
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,370
isn't,
so it's not absolute zero.

105
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,840
I can't come up with any procedure that
is going to say 100 percent of the time

106
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,170
this Adam's going to end up in the
ground state and that's what I would

107
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:37,160
need to be able to claim that I'd really
gotten to absolute zero,

108
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,630
but on the other hand,
I can get so close to absolute zero that

109
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:46,160
for many experiments it's basically
absolutely zero for all practical

110
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:49,190
purposes,
but not for all experiments and we're

111
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,610
constantly working on trying to make
things colder because for some

112
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:55,220
experiments it really matters that we're
not quite there.

113
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,470
Well,
my reaction to hearing about the Nobel

114
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:05,471
prize was one of
a shock and disbelief.

115
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,440
In fact,
I can remember very,

116
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:13,100
very well when this happened.
I was attending a meeting in California

117
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:16,430
meeting of the American Physical Society
and the Optical Society of America

118
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:19,880
meeting jointly,
a out in California in Long Beach,

119
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:24,200
California.
And the day before the prizes were

120
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:27,110
announced,
a number of us were sitting around after

121
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:31,790
the scientific sessions were over
speculating about who was going to get

122
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,040
the Nobel prize that year.
And believe me,

123
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,410
nobody brought up my name.
Uh,

124
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,540
so later that night,
well,

125
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,830
it was the middle of the night,
uh,

126
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:45,010
that I got a call in my hotel room to
the effect that I had a shared the Nobel

127
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,230
prize with quad cone to new egg.
And Steve Chu came as a complete shock.

128
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,620
My life changed dramatically.
Um,

129
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,160
uh,
it's very difficult for me to keep up

130
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:05,900
with all of the invitations that I get
to speak about my work.

131
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,430
I'm a,
the size of my research group has,

132
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,590
has grown.
That's made it possible for me to be

133
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:15,770
involved in more and more new kinds of
physics.

134
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,300
But it's made it harder and harder for
me to be intimately familiar with all

135
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:22,250
the things that are going on.
So there's a kind of a,

136
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:27,450
of a tension between the joy in doing
lots of new things and the desire to

137
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:30,830
understand them better and better.
Um,

138
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,790
another thing that I never would have
imagined would have been a,

139
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,240
one of the results of,
um,

140
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:45,050
becoming a Nobel laureate is that I
ended up meeting people who are actually

141
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:47,930
famous.
So,

142
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,711
you know,
people say,

143
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:49,580
Oh,
you're a Nobel laureate,

144
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,540
you must be famous.
No,

145
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,580
nobody remembers,
you know,

146
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:57,581
outside of the field in which working.
Nobody remembers who won the Nobel prize

147
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:01,020
a even a couple of years ago.
Uh,

148
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,600
but as a result of being a Nobel
laureate,

149
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:05,930
I get invited to a,
uh,

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,820
to things where I've met people who are
actually famous.

151
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,840
One of the people that I have met who
has been most charming,

152
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,530
uh,
is Dr Ruth Westheimer.

153
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,390
Uh,
she lives in New York City and uh,

154
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,400
I see her probably about once a year and
she's just a wonderfully warm and

155
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,650
genuine person.
Just,

156
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:33,780
just a,
just a joy to know as a friend.

157
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,041
Well,
first of all,

158
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,370
I should say that I,
I'm not particularly comfortable with

159
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:45,180
being described as a religious person
because somehow I have this image in my

160
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:49,500
mind of,
of somebody who's who's very proper and

161
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,400
prim and follows all sorts of rituals
and stuff.

162
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:54,260
And,
and I,

163
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,970
I liked rather to describe myself as a
person of faith.

164
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,530
Um,
and uh,

165
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,670
clearly I don't believe that science has
made belief in God obsolete or else I

166
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:07,350
wouldn't describe myself as a person of
faith.

167
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:13,190
Uh,
I believe that certain ways of

168
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,770
interpreting a certain scriptures have
been made obsolete by science,

169
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:24,140
but that in no way makes religious faith
or belief in God obsolete.

170
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:28,230
It just requires what I would consider
to be a,

171
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,230
a,
a different outlook of maturation of

172
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,900
religious faith.
But if we look at the history of

173
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:38,550
religious faith as told in the
scriptures and as seen throughout

174
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:42,030
history,
I think the entire history of faith has

175
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:47,031
been one of a maturation of that faith.
I see it not so much as people becoming

176
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:54,081
more mature in their faith,
but God challenging people to become

177
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,040
more mature,
to get a clear understanding of what God

178
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:04,041
wants for humankind,
and I think God is always pushing us to

179
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:07,200
be better than what we are.

180
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,300
Okay,
so there's two ways of answering that

181
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:17,301
question.
By and large science and religion deal

182
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:22,701
with different kinds of questions.
Science deals with questions about how

183
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,850
things come to be the way they are.
How should I think about the way things

184
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:29,760
are?
How shall I organize my understanding of

185
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:34,590
the way things behave?
Whereas religion deals with questions

186
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:38,790
like,
how should I behave toward my fellow

187
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,080
human creatures?
What should my relationship be to God?

188
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:48,081
How should I understand the ultimate
origins of this world in this universe

189
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,960
in which we live is a very different
kinds of questions,

190
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:57,110
but sometimes the areas that science
addresses and the areas that our

191
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:02,881
religion addresses can overlap.
So I don't ascribe to the idea of

192
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,480
science and religion as being non
overlapping.

193
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:10,270
Magisterial has sometimes been
described,

194
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,660
but I also will say that by and large,
they deal with different kinds of

195
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:20,380
questions,
but there are ethical questions that

196
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:25,381
might involve things like medical ethics
or environmental questions where you

197
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:30,340
have to understand the science in order
to be able to make good ethical

198
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:32,710
decisions that are guided by your
religious principles.

199
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,400
So there's always going to be places
where science and religion are gonna

200
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,850
come to bear on the same kinds of
problems

201
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,180
all the time.
In fact,

202
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,050
it's one of the greatest things about
being a scientist is that you're

203
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:55,051
continually surprised.
Nature is so much more clever than we

204
00:12:55,181 --> 00:13:00,181
are that we never understand the secrets
that nature has to has to offer.

205
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,530
But little by little we learned more and
more,

206
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,630
but every time we go into the
laboratory,

207
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,950
we're surprised.
I work in an area of physics,

208
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:15,820
atomic physics,
where the basic principles,

209
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:19,180
as far as we know,
the basic principles were pretty much

210
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:24,181
understood in the 19 thirties.
Maybe some details were worked out in

211
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:28,780
the forties and fifties,
but we are still surprised everyday by

212
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:30,190
the results of these things.
So.

213
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,100
So in spite of the fact that some people
might say,

214
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,300
well,
there's nothing new,

215
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,100
we're surprised every day and the things
we learned were things that nobody

216
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,410
imagined that things would work this
way.

217
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:44,290
So for example,
let's go back to this example about

218
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:44,890
laser cooling.

219
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,780
Everybody thought they understood how
cold you could get things using laser

220
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:53,430
cooling and the problem was as simple
enough problem,

221
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,390
you can write down the proof and in a
few minutes as to how cold is possible,

222
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,590
get something.
And we got it eventually,

223
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:02,500
200 times colder for,
for one particular item.

224
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:04,390
Then the theory said was possible.
Why?

225
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,940
Well,
because the situation was a little bit

226
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:09,790
more complicated.
Remember I said that physicists like to,

227
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,250
uh,
make a problem really simple.

228
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,320
That's the physicist way of looking at a
problem.

229
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,820
Well,
Einstein once said,

230
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,430
a problem should be made as simple as
possible,

231
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,270
but no simpler.
And sometimes you make a mistake and

232
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:24,190
you'll leave out some really important
stuff.

233
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,820
Usually when you do that,
it makes things worse.

234
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,040
This was a case where putting in the
complications made things work better.

235
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,590
Nobody would have guessed that that was
gonna happen.

236
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,650
I can't imagine anybody sitting down and
thinking,

237
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,050
okay,
we're going to figure out how laser

238
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:44,710
cooling works and coming up with what
actually happens.

239
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,240
We had to do the experiments first.
Nature showed us what was,

240
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,630
what was gonna happen,
and then clever people figured out what

241
00:14:52,631 --> 00:14:53,620
was really going on.

242
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,340
Kinds of surprises happen to us all the
time.
