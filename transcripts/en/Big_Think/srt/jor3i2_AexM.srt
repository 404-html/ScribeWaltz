1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,540
Okay.
There were some very definite,

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,980
uh,
qualities to good leaders will.

3
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:16,470
One is decisiveness.
If you have decision anxiety,

4
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:21,270
it kind of says that you don't have
confidence and people are frightened to

5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,390
be led by somebody who doesn't have
confidence,

6
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:28,080
doesn't appear to know the direction
that the company is going.

7
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:30,390
And you know,
you always want to get in the trenches

8
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:32,700
with somebody who you think is going to
win the battle.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,820
And so confidence and is very big part
of leadership being decisive.

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,190
I think having,
um,

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,660
a sense of compassion is also important
for leadership because you can order

12
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:52,380
somebody to come in on the weekends and
work over time,

13
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,550
but you can't make them come up with
their best ideas.

14
00:00:56,551 --> 00:01:00,620
They have to do that because they care
about you and they want to please you

15
00:01:00,621 --> 00:01:03,330
in.
And you're a leader that motivates that

16
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,750
kind of passion in them.
If you don't do that,

17
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:09,810
if you're just leading by being a
dictator or by fear,

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,890
um,
eventually it's going to come back to,

19
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,880
you know,
bite you where you don't want to be

20
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:20,280
better and you won't get the kind of
dedication that you are looking right.
