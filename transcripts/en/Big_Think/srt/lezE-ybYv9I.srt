1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,953
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,800
I think one dilemma you always have is
a profession really depends on our being

3
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:22,930
able to publish our work in peer review
journals.

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,520
So what gets published,
it's really been gone over with a fine

5
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:32,110
tooth comb and so we review each other's
papers and

6
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,260
you have to decide when you have a
conflict of interest or not.

7
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,740
And if someone's work is too close to
yours,

8
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,830
if they're a competitor,
I think you have to stay away from it

9
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,380
because there's an obvious conflict of
interest,

10
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,800
a little bit less obvious if you have
people,

11
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,890
uh,
who's the people whose papers who wrote

12
00:00:56,441 --> 00:01:00,550
the papers from your lab there,
former postdocs or students.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,030
I think that's also like a conflict of
interest.

14
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,550
And I think it's a,
it's uh,

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,590
there are gray areas work that's sort of
close to your work,

16
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:14,380
but I mean where,
where do you draw the line of when it's

17
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,490
okay to review someone else's work?
We at a paper or a grant,

18
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,650
uh,
and when is it not?

19
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,050
And when it's self interest,
a creeping in.

20
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,810
And,
um,

21
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,550
you know,
I think it's very important that the

22
00:01:30,551 --> 00:01:35,551
peer review process,
is this the best thing we have a that it

23
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:37,840
be a,
as pure as possible.

24
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,980
It's never going to be perfect,
but I think it's worth thinking about.

25
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,061
And,
uh,

26
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:46,810
and it poses,
poses dilemmas on a regular basis.
