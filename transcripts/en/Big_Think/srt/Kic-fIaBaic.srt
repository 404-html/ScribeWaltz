1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,790
I was raised with a Tarion.
Um,

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,060
and

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,350
my mother said she took us to church so
that we wouldn't,

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,560
uh,
okay.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,370
Get religious later in life.
She was above and both my parents were

6
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:23,371
atheists and my grandmother was an
atheist and in rural Kentucky.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,880
And so they were trying to make sure
that my brother and I would be atheist

8
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:27,880
too.
And it worked,

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,780
which doesn't mean that we didn't,
they didn't teach us a lot of,

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,010
uh,
sort of wonder of science and of nature

11
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:39,250
in the world and all of that.
I think they gave us all of that,

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,660
but they are

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,170
both highly skeptical people.
I got that

14
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:51,840
to be,
um,

15
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:54,581
yeah,
no,

16
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:55,300
it,
it didn't,

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,050
the only problem was that my mother's
parents were southern Baptists and

18
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:02,440
devout and it was very upsetting them to
the idea,

19
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,913
mmm.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,260
That we didn't believe in God.
So I told him that I did because I

21
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:12,010
thought that was really cool because
they were worried that we would go to

22
00:01:12,011 --> 00:01:12,844
hell.
So,

23
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,650
um,
my grandmother asked me

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,410
once,
she said,

25
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,910
I don't care about anything except that
you count what you believe in God.

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,220
I think in this next one I'm working on
for sure because it

27
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,280
definitely reared its head in modern day
talking.

28
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:30,870
And I mean,
I,

29
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,200
I just came from an interview where
Lewis Black was coming in right after me

30
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,390
and I had met him before and we talked
about all of this.

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,673
And,
um,

32
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,050
it's everywhere.
Everyone's talking.

33
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:40,861
There's,
there's of course,

34
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:44,280
a huge evangelical movement recently and
now there's a,

35
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,860
there's an atheist movement that often
seems to me,

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,610
I was raised to be really nice to people
and kind of out there beliefs.

37
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,630
Um,
and so a lot of it seems really overly

38
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,000
self righteous,
odd.

39
00:01:57,001 --> 00:02:00,560
Like in the same way that evangelicals
are where it is.

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,650
I just think it's not,

41
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,670
I don't believe any of that stuff,

42
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,950
but I don't,
not mad about it.
