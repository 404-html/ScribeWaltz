1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,450
Mm,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,850
when we started the Tribeca film
festival,

3
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:12,960
which we announced in 2001 right after
nine slash 11,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,210
uh,
to really bring people back to our

5
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:19,020
neighborhood.
Our goal was to just bring as many

6
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:23,070
people back downtown is possible.
When we announced the first film

7
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:27,870
festival,
we asked Nelson Mandela to come and

8
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:30,480
speak.
Our city had been devastated.

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,920
Our country has been devastated by nine
slash 11.

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,280
And as filmmakers we didn't know what to
do other than literally to put on a show

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,440
and to try to give,
to try to give our neighborhood a new

12
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:49,920
memory,
to try to give New York a new memory and

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,980
you just couldn't go like start running
movies.

14
00:00:55,051 --> 00:01:00,051
So men Mandela came and he talked about
when he was in Robben Island,

15
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:05,730
when he was in prison,
that the one night that he and his

16
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:09,420
jailers all looked forward to was movie
night.

17
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:14,220
It's when they could come together and
they could laugh about the same thing.

18
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,790
They could cry about the same thing.
And they were,

19
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,640
they were one.
It was finding their similarities,

20
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:24,600
finding what was human about each of
them.

21
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,660
And no matter what side of the door
either one was going to end up at,

22
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,130
at the end of the night.
And I always think back to that and the

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,520
sense of community of coming together as
community to watch something is actually

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,440
extraordinary.
When you look at the nea in potential

25
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:54,240
cuts to the nea and you look at what
would happen to pbs,

26
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,680
uh,
it's criminal,

27
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,550
okay.
The arts reflect to a country what a

28
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:06,840
country is.
The arts reflect who we are as a people

29
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,380
and to lose that is losing part of our,
our soul.

30
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,490
You know,
the nea has been,

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,890
you know,
there've been other administrations that

32
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:23,480
have tried to cut the nea before,
uh,

33
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,040
but it's such a small amount in the
budget.

34
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,510
And it is again,
a reflection of,

35
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,110
of,
of who we are as a people and no matter

36
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:39,111
where you are in the ecosystem of being
a filmmaker,

37
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:42,870
a producer and actor,
it is always hard to get your project.

38
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,770
Maybe it is,
you know,

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,220
sometimes it happens very quickly,
but for the most part,

40
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,670
um,
it's never easy will artists get by

41
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,960
while we find a way to make work.
Yes.

42
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,590
But when I looked and I talked to a,
my friend will be Goldberg.

43
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:05,290
Some of her early work was funded by the
NEA.

44
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,130
Uh,
there is a wonderful piece on youtube of

45
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,370
Mr Rogers talking to Senator John Lopez
story explaining what he did as Mr

46
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,570
Rogers on pbs and it's just so charming
to listen to that and you're going,

47
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,130
how can you cut that?
One of the things is that our best,

48
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,460
our best export becomes our,
our shows or movies or entertainment.

49
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,070
And um,
I remember reading a piece after,

50
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,400
um,
I think it was nick kristoff writing

51
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:46,990
about how when they first went into
Afghanistan and,

52
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:48,200
uh,
you know,

53
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,310
in the,
in the nineties and people were digging

54
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:56,311
up their old vcrs after the Taliban had
left.

55
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:58,480
At that time,
there were digging,

56
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,990
going into the backyard,
digging up vrs and they were coming with

57
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:02,800
their,
you know,

58
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,920
dirty,
old brs that they had buried.

59
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,000
And um,
and the titanic and cassettes at the

60
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:10,990
titanic,
I mean,

61
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,750
they,
they love our love,

62
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:17,380
our movies.
They don't always love us,

63
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,440
but movies do remain a movie.
And I,

64
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,291
I,
I mean,

65
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,470
stories.
Our stories become most,

66
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:28,270
uh,
valuable,

67
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,770
uh,
exports.
