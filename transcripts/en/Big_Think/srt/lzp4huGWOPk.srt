1
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,730
I must have talked about that before,
but that's definitely an in Max Tivoli.

2
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,820
There's a lot of passing.

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:18,070
He is a different age than he appears to
be cause he's aging backwards.

4
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:20,440
So he,
he's always pretending to be something

5
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:24,250
else.
And his friend Huey is passing and

6
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,160
there's the mme who's trying to change
herself.

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,340
Um,
and then the story of a marriage,

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,330
there's a way in which the book is
passing for a while.

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,270
The main character doesn't reveal things
about herself and a lot of the

10
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,470
characters.
Um,

11
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,360
I think certainly for Max Tivoli,
it was very much on my mind for that

12
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:45,040
time period,
that turn of the century,

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,580
19th to 20th,
it seemed like the moment when emigrants

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,880
could transform out of their own
stereotype into an Americanness and then

15
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:58,690
America was ready to
ready to believe them.

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,950
Um,
when a lot of groups we're able to do

17
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:04,120
that.
But I think there's something kind of

18
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:06,730
sad about it too,
to leave all that behind.

19
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,090
So I was really experimenting with what
was complicated about it because Max

20
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:15,540
gets to do a lot of things and have his
heart's desire,

21
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,980
but he pays a great prices so that
everyone around

22
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,950
you,
it's hard to know.

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:27,950
It's very good.

24
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,870
Curious thing.
I don't think any of us ever thought

25
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:33,620
there would be a black president phil
nominee as of yesterday when we're

26
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:35,150
taping this.
Um,

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,890
Aye.
I,

28
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,290
I,
but he's,

29
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,250
he is,
he is not hiding his race in any way.

30
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,900
I think he's,
something's happening where a lot of

31
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:53,420
people are accepting him

32
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,783
mmm.

33
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,400
On the terms he's talking about and he's
not pretending anything as far as I can

34
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:02,791
tell him.
I mean,

35
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,910
he's a politician,
so he's pretending everything in a way.

36
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,010
Um,
but the line he's drawing is one,

37
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,200
I'm prepared to stand behind.
Um,

38
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,590
and a lot of politicians,
I just feel like none of it's real.

39
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,780
I don't think it'll work.
You know,

40
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,650
I don't think people would buy it if he
tried to pretend that race didn't matter

41
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,920
because that's what he was faced with.
He had to give that speech.

42
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,230
Um,
and he could've said,

43
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,570
why are we talking about race?
And the steady said,

44
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,910
we need to talk about race.
That's what shocked me really got me.

45
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,870
There was a story that

46
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,420
my grandmother told me about 10 years
ago about herself in which she,

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,860
a friend of her husbands of my
grandfather's,

48
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,660
took her for a drive around Rural
Kentucky.

49
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,300
Uh,
must've been the early fifties.

50
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,650
And he turned to her,
he stopped the car and he turned to her

51
00:03:06,651 --> 00:03:07,600
and he said,
Leona,

52
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,450
uh,
I was your husband's lover in the war

53
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,310
and I'm as lover now and I want to leave
with him and I want you to help me.

54
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,793
And

55
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,470
she could not tell me the rest of the
story because I think the idea was so

56
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:25,600
crazy and absurd that you just said,
let me out of this car.

57
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:27,300
I never want to see you again.
And it was all over.

58
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,100
She never talked to my grandfather about
it.

59
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,800
And she regretted all her life that she
couldn't have left.

60
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,930
But she always told me,
she said,

61
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,850
I had,
I had two sons.

62
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,710
I'd never had a job.
I was a poor woman.

63
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:42,540
I don't understand what I was supposed
to do.

64
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,630
She all the restrictions were honor and
oddly,

65
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:50,631
that's a part of the story I really
liked was to identify with the woman and

66
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:53,970
see how trapped she was.
Obviously her husband,

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,980
my grandfather was trapped.
If it's a true story,

68
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:58,410
which I don't know,
I'm grandmother told a lot of crazy

69
00:03:58,411 --> 00:04:00,660
things,
but it doesn't matter to me as a

70
00:04:00,661 --> 00:04:01,710
novelist.
Um,

71
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,710
okay,
he's trapped for sure.

72
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,570
We know that.
But what was,

73
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,330
what made her so trapped and what made
her life harder than his and a lot of

74
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:14,710
ways and that that was the story.
I wondered what's out.
