1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,320
I wrote the best intentions out of the
low points

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:12,750
in American UN relations and immediate
period after Iraq and so forth,

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,630
and that things are better than they
were.

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,380
I also think the UN has gotten
marginalized in a lot of ways and

5
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:23,020
partially because of the Bush
administration,

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,030
uh,
I think we sent an ambassador there,

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,490
John Bolton,
who was very hostile to the institution

8
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:33,430
that reduced America's own role,
the Air America zone.

9
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:38,050
Standing there.
We also had the chief hand in choosing

10
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:42,790
the Secretary General Ban Ki Moon,
now ban Ki Moon is not quite two years

11
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:47,791
into his five year term.
And it is possible that he will prove to

12
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:50,080
be a more forceful figure than he has so
far.

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,430
But certainly the impression one gets is
that the United States chose them

14
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:57,130
because they thought he would be an
inoffensive pro-american figure.

15
00:00:57,131 --> 00:00:59,410
And that's what he's been.
He's been an inoffensive pro American

16
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:01,590
figure.
But if we actually want the UN to

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,450
matter,
then we have to choose it's chief

18
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:07,810
executive for his competence,
not for his harmlessness.

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,430
Uh,
and so it's just troubling that we have

20
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:16,420
not sought to use this institution in
the way that it can be used.

21
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:17,590
And I would hope that Obama,

22
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,390
we'll take it more seriously.
