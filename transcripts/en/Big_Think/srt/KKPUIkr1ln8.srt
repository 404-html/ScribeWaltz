1
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,350
Absolutely not.
These are complex issues that have

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,970
technical components,
technological components,

3
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:20,971
scientific components to their solution,
but none of these things happen if we

4
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:26,720
don't have the understanding through
society what needs to be done if we

5
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:31,721
don't have the political and uh,
and national well to take the steps that

6
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:36,881
we have to take if we don't innovate in
the way in which we organize work as

7
00:00:36,891 --> 00:00:39,290
well as organized science and
technology.

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,800
It all has to work together.
And I'd like to believe that despite the

9
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:50,420
fact that we look at these things and
look at globalization as daunting

10
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:53,930
problems,
they're really terrific opportunities.

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,380
And at this point in time,
no nation on the face of the globe has a

12
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:02,150
better hand to play in the United
States.

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,480
Uh,
because we are still the best,

14
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,790
uh,
particularly at the cutting edge and

15
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:11,540
science and technology.
We're dramatically challenged by other

16
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:12,980
countries as we should be.

17
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,880
We're still the best and unlike much of
the world,

18
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,330
we build what we do on these remarkable
substrates of a diverse population and a

19
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:27,150
democracy and a,
uh,

20
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,040
an open market system.
I believe we've got the best

21
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:36,230
possibilities in the world of helping to
resolve these problems and providing

22
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:39,620
leadership and having prosperity in the
future,

23
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,020
but we can't do it if we don't have the
core science and technology.

24
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,820
If we don't have young men and women,
whether they're going to be signed,

25
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:53,540
the stress engineers or not.
If we don't have young men and women who

26
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:58,430
have some technological literacy,
some quantitative skills,

27
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,040
some understanding of the world at
large,

28
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,480
then we're going to be in trouble.
But the basic answer to your question is

29
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,750
technology alone can never solve these
large scale problems.

30
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,300
On the other hand,
we can't solve them without it.
