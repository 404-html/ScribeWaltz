1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,150
Disconnect is three different stories
that were pulled right out of the

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:06,270
headlines and dramatized and then
threaded together,

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,180
you know,
to,

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,510
to create an emotional thriller.
It's about the way that technology,

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,660
all these screens in our lives can,
uh,

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,580
can bring us closer and then can also,
uh,

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,770
keep us farther apart from,
from each other.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,060
And,
uh,

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,690
the movies not just about technology,
it's also about the way in which we

10
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,750
communicate with each other about how
people talk to each other.

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,550
Um,
and uh,

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,870
that was very interesting to me and very
important to me to explores the way in

13
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:37,740
which we communicate and to me
ultimately the movies much more about

14
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:40,350
the power of human communication.
Um,

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,220
then about technology.
Technology is neither good nor bad.

16
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:46,080
It is a reflection of us,
you know,

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,060
technology puts,
puts,

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,890
makes bombs and it,
and it can,

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,391
you know,
put,

20
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:51,270
put us on Mars.

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,970
I've met people who were very
distractable people who are always on

22
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,180
their phones.
They were distractible people to begin

23
00:00:57,181 --> 00:01:00,420
with.
And I've met wonderfully calm and wise

24
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:02,760
people who keep their phones in their
pockets.

25
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,620
And especially during dinner.
Those were calm and centered people.

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,640
So I don't think technology makes us do
anything.

27
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,240
I think it's a personalities that are
expressed through all these devices that

28
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,070
we have.
And that's one of the things,

29
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:17,540
the,
uh,

30
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,540
the film tries to explore.
We've never had been able to be as close

31
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,210
with all these people everywhere in our
lives on different continents before,

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,880
as we have now.
And that's very exciting.

33
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,480
Um,
but when you are connected to thousands

34
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:37,730
of people,
um,

35
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,990
it's,
it's hard to find time for the people

36
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:41,970
that you really want to connect with,
you know,

37
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:46,971
so that's just one of the ways in which
the duality of technology affects our

38
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:49,370
attention span.
I mean,

39
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,730
we've never been in the history of
mankind connected with so many people

40
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:59,070
that we've never been asked to focus on
so many different things until this time

41
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,320
right now.
Um,

42
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,450
now we are,
you know,

43
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,580
it is so easy to talk to a,
to 300 people in a day.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,160
So it's an exciting time,
I think for us,

45
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:12,960
for us humans.
Um,

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,910
but with it comes a,

47
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,080
that was Samantha's phone that just went
off and gave us a little interlude.

48
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,040
It was.
But I think it's really exciting.

49
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,480
You know,
I love technology.

50
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,410
I'm excited that I was alive when the
Internet exploded.

51
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,130
This is not an anti technology movie at
all,

52
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,130
but it's asking questions that I think
everyone is asking every day,

53
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,270
how much time do you spend on the
internet or how much time do you spend

54
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:56,340
on your phone?
How much time do you spend connected

55
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:59,290
with those 100 people as opposed to
those 100 people,

56
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,450
you know,
who do you really give your time and

57
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:04,600
your attention to a,
these are decisions we have to make now

58
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,280
every day.
Whereas,

59
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,031
you know,
10,

60
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:09,130
20 years ago we didn't have to make
those decisions.

61
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,380
You know,
we just sort of hung out with whoever

62
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:12,190
was in front of us.
