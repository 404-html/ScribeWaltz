1
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,180
Sort of roundabout way I got into the
story because my,

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,940
my great grandmother,
sister and my great grandmother

3
00:00:13,941 --> 00:00:16,820
immigrated to the United States from
Slovenia in Nineteen Oh,

4
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:19,530
five.
And one weekend my great grandmother's

5
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:22,640
sister went to Chicago and was never
heard from again.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,691
Um,
and I,

7
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,370
you know,
it was always intrigued about this and

8
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:28,490
didn't really know much about the story.
Nobody in my family had any,

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,480
um,
really,

10
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:30,980
um,
traceable information.

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,150
But I thought it would be interesting
just to explore the circumstances that

12
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:38,420
could have led to her disappearance.
And because I knew Chicago was a pretty

13
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:42,380
dynamic and dangerous place at the time.
So I just started going through

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,260
microfilm,
a Chicago Tribune Microfilm and 19 and

15
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:49,820
five and came upon the marshal field
junior shooting and was immediately

16
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,400
intrigued by that because it was huge
news.

17
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:54,920
And um,
soon after coming upon this shooting,

18
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,520
I found the everlys sisters.
And,

19
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:57,370
and then of course,
you know,

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,380
forgot all about my missing relative
because they were so much more

21
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:01,214
interesting.

22
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,540
I,

23
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,570
I never cared to know.
Once I,

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,280
like I said,
once I came upon the elderly sisters,

25
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,440
I didn't care about finding anything
about her,

26
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:18,500
but I got an email a few months ago from
somebody who said,

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,050
you know,
Dear Karen,

28
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:23,630
I'm not a stalker,
but I found your great grandmother and

29
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:25,550
the Ellis Island records,
um,

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,210
and it seems,
and I fell,

31
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:33,211
so found another woman named Maria who
came over with her non nine in 1905.

32
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:35,990
But in 19.
Oh four.

33
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,150
Um,
and they both settled in Pittsburgh,

34
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:43,151
which is where my family had settled and
the person said they tried to track to

35
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:46,790
see if this woman went to Chicago,
but there was no record of her in

36
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,270
Chicago,
which if,

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,630
if it were her was,
her,

38
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,010
wouldn't have been surprising.
Um,

39
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,550
you know,
being that she was a poor immigrant.

40
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,710
Um,
and if so she did disappear.

41
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,800
It certainly would have been high on the
police departments,

42
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:59,900
um,
priority list to sort of track down and

43
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:03,140
see what happened to her.
So that was the closest I got to,

44
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,090
to um,
any other clue.

45
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,650
And I assumed that that was probably.

46
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,250
Well,
the sister is a good question because

47
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,390
they were very,
um,

48
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:21,920
part of their main facet of their
personalities was their ability to sort

49
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:25,310
of camouflage who they are and to keep
changing who they were and to change

50
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:29,930
their backstory so frequently that,
that nobody really could pin them down

51
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,510
and they told people they were from
Kentucky,

52
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:35,720
they told people they were from Virginia
and they told people they were from

53
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:40,220
Indiana and I was able to pin down that
they were in fact from this wealthy

54
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:41,860
family in Virginia.
Um,

55
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,610
but they had fallen on hard times and
nobody knew the really sad part of their

56
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:48,500
story,
which was that their father is the one

57
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,900
who forced them into prostitution at a
very young age.

58
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,810
Um,
and they of course lead everybody to

59
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:55,630
believe that they just decided to become
mad.

60
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:57,030
I'm just on a whim,
um,

61
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,060
after sort of coming into an inheritance
enjoining a theatrical troupe and,

62
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,730
and seeing that this might be a good
business opportunity.

63
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,811
Um,
so,

64
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:08,260
so there was a sort of sad undercurrent
to their story that,

65
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:09,280
that was really interest.

66
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,590
I think it was,
it was terrible.

67
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,680
Things,
I do think that they were colored by

68
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:21,120
their experience,
um,

69
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,800
and,
and being forced to be prostitutes

70
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:24,000
themselves.
Um,

71
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,190
they,
like many people who became magnums,

72
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,220
they,
they began in the business like that and

73
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:33,200
I think that they were subjected to such
degradation that they really would

74
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,570
concern them,
that they wanted girls that they had not

75
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:38,520
to be.
They wanted to spoil their girls,

76
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:40,530
not exploit them.
They wanted to treat them as they wish

77
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:42,030
they had been treated.
Um,

78
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:45,570
I think that was a large part of it.
I think the other thing was they saw,

79
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,150
looked around and,
and we're realists and saw that there

80
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:51,090
was not much opportunity for women.
This is 100 years ago,

81
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:53,910
women couldn't vote.
A women couldn't even enter saloons

82
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:55,170
where politics were discussed.
I mean,

83
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:58,570
there was absolutely no way for women to
enter political discourse or,

84
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,680
or have a say in anything.
Um,

85
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,430
and all of these reformers who were
trying to quote unquote help these

86
00:04:05,431 --> 00:04:06,560
women,
um,

87
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,010
these sisters were actually doing work
concretely to help these women than they

88
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:11,491
were,
you know,

89
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:14,420
providing them with food and clothes
and,

90
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,270
and meals.

91
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,810
Just from me of something funny
Minnesota,

92
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,130
she said it entertaining,
most men in the parlors is more tiresome

93
00:04:29,131 --> 00:04:31,380
than with the girls lose their social
standing over.

94
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,090
Um,
so,

95
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:34,680
so yeah,
girls were lose,

96
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,070
lost our social standing by being
promiscuous by being prostitutes.

97
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,510
A lot of girls in fact were kicked out
of their home for being promiscuous.

98
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,060
I mean,
it was such as considered such a

99
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:47,880
egregious offense back then that you
could actually be kicked out of your

100
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:49,950
home and a lot of them enter
prostitution.

101
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,851
Figuring,
well,

102
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:52,230
if I'm going to be kicked out of my
home,

103
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:54,820
I might as well be paid for it.
What?

104
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,310
Of course,
it was a huge stigma.

105
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,200
Um,
and I think the elderly sisters,

106
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,060
part of their,
part of their goal was to help girls to

107
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:05,400
reform themselves in terms of returning
them back to polite society if that's

108
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,970
what their ultimate goal was.
A lot of their girls ended up after

109
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:11,550
leaving the club,
marrying into wealthy families across

110
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,760
the United States.
I'm marrying senators and prominent

111
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:16,620
businessmen and whatnot.
Um,

112
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:17,770
so,
you know,

113
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,050
men,
of course there wasn't a stigma.

114
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,020
In fact,
that was a badge of honor to be admitted

115
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,000
into the everly club.
Of course,

116
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:25,830
the usual double standard applied,
but,

117
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:26,730
but,
you know,

118
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:30,240
the everly clubbed seemed to be the one
place where girls could sort of overcome

119
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:31,074
that,
that,

120
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,433
that stigma,

121
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,610
I think part

122
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,520
of their power came from,
from the fact that they were able to.

123
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:48,230
So I'm so completely covered there pass.
I'm in the book,

124
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:51,500
I call them in 19th century amalgamation
of Martha Stewart and Madonna.

125
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,480
Um,
because they just kept reinventing

126
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:56,990
themselves and reinventing themselves.
And I even think that minute in,

127
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,430
by the time they were older,
they believed every lie they ever told.

128
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,570
Um,
I think that they completely bought into

129
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:09,280
the idea that they were aristocratic
ladies who had these,

130
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:10,280
you know,
privileged,

131
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,220
lovely upbringings and,
and never had a hard day in her life.

132
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,360
Um,
I think that by that point that that's

133
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,000
their story and they were sticking to it
and no one really had any right or,

134
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,060
or a reason

135
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,350
to know anything different.

136
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,150
The early sisters wielded tremendous
power and part of the reason they went

137
00:06:33,151 --> 00:06:34,320
into this business,
it was,

138
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,110
if you think about it,
it was the only viable,

139
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,230
um,
business where a woman could actually be

140
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:43,380
the commander,
not the commander in chief,

141
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,910
the CEO,
if you will.

142
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,600
I mean,
it was the only women did not run in the

143
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:50,820
street.
They weren't masters of their domain.

144
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,660
This was the only industry where women
could actually assume a position of

145
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:57,930
power.
And the everglades sisters were very

146
00:06:57,931 --> 00:06:59,440
powerful in that regard.
They,

147
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:02,670
they dictated who was allowed on their
club and who wasn't.

148
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:05,340
They had a very specific set of rules,
um,

149
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,290
you know,
in the men paid dearly for that.

150
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,190
And I think,
uh,

151
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:10,920
the sisters felt that if anyone was
being exploited,

152
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:13,390
it was the men in this equation,
um,

153
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,410
especially in light of the fact that the
way they treated their women and made

154
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:22,110
sure that the women were never abused by
these men are mistreated by these men.

155
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,000
Um,
I can't say the same for other,

156
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,500
for other brothels.
Um,

157
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:26,550
I think that,
um,

158
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,780
especially when the men were in charge,
either there were there,

159
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,860
um,
the,

160
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,850
the exchange of power,

161
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:37,030
much difference.
This all was one of my favorites

162
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,670
characters.
Um,

163
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,220
she,
she was the rival Matt,

164
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:47,010
I'm the rival Madam to the everly
sisters and,

165
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,530
and sort of was the Queen Bee Madam
until they came to town and,

166
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,360
and um,
you know,

167
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:54,880
had,
had worked her way up and spent quite a

168
00:07:54,881 --> 00:07:58,990
bit of time and effort really
establishing herself in Chicago and she

169
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:02,260
was this scrappy,
relentless woman who was not uptown,

170
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:03,510
you know,
she didn't even know what I've tabbed

171
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,730
looked like and she did not at all
appreciate these two sort of

172
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:09,040
aristocratic sister sauntering in with
their,

173
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,010
they're flying ehrs and,
and sort of taking what she thought was

174
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:13,540
rightfully hers.
And um,

175
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,680
the fact that you tried to frame them
for murder twice as a,

176
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:17,821
it was,
I,

177
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:19,390
I mean,
I just couldn't have made her up.

178
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,570
And I always say if there's ever a film
adaptation,

179
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,660
a bet midler has to play.
Vic Shaw,

180
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,450
I actually sent back with a copy of the
book,

181
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:29,700
but I'm,
you know,

182
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:31,990
I'm sure she's,
she's going to call me any minute now

183
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:33,580
and want to do that.
But,

184
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,120
but,
uh,

185
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,690
you know,
I,

186
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,523
I really don't enjoy

187
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,680
the.
