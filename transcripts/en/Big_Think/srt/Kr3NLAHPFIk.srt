1
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,230
Well,
he's young people have been drawn up in

2
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:21,231
the culture of a enormous wealth and
enormous power,

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,000
enormous opportunity,
uh,

4
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:27,510
the least well off of them is
considerably better than the best of

5
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:31,500
their ancestors.
I think they recognize that they see the

6
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:36,501
signs of success as a world defined
success and opulence on every hand.

7
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,630
They are surrounded by sensation.
They're surrounded by violence.

8
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,850
They are surrounded by a politics.
None of these are capable of delivering

9
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:52,440
the goods.
And I think they recognize that and I

10
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:56,400
think there is a desire to find
something that will last,

11
00:00:56,401 --> 00:01:00,870
something that will do something that
will not disappoint and letting you do

12
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:05,820
that in very evidently you attempted to
turn back to the elders,

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,280
to the wisdom of another age,
uh,

14
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,550
to something that might not seem to have
appeal to you in your earlier phase.

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,340
But your earlier phase you recognize was
a deceitful and deceptive one.

16
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,330
You ask Harvard graduates whether all
going and they're all going to go.

17
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,790
Ninety percent of the seniors in any
given class,

18
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,420
say they're going into three cities,
they're going to go to Washington just

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,080
to put things right power.
They're going to go to New York to make

20
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:35,490
lots of money.
Uh,

21
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,750
the material world and the going to Los
Angeles to have fun fantasy.

22
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,670
And I think they've come back from all
three of those cities discovering that

23
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,740
like ours,
there's no there,

24
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:50,850
there a Washington is not going to turn
the world right side up.

25
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,090
Uh,
all the money in New York doesn't spare

26
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:55,890
it.
The troubles and tribulations of living

27
00:01:55,891 --> 00:02:00,891
in New York and all the fantasy from
Lala Latin doesn't dull the pain of

28
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:05,280
living in a life with no meaning and no
value.

29
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,390
And that's a modest symbol.
I think people say,

30
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,030
okay,
that must be another way.

31
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,030
Maybe Jerusalem is the place,
uh,

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,990
maybe a,
a,

33
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,620
a pilgrimage to the holy city is the
place.

34
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:23,490
Maybe some Ashram somewhere,
maybe sitting under a Bodhi tree who

35
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:27,090
knows?
But there are wiser people than we who

36
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:29,580
years ago have discovered some of these
truths.

37
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,050
Maybe we even heard them in our youth.
And maybe the trick is to try to

38
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:36,930
recapture,
recover some of that for ourselves.

39
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,630
Now.
I think that's part of the excitement.

40
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,330
Well,
it's against me that young people are

41
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,350
smiling.
We think that the,

42
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,470
they're not prepared to buy a pig in the
poke,

43
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,110
that they are not prepared to put up
with the,

44
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,820
uh,
the triumph of the material or

45
00:02:56,821 --> 00:03:01,060
limitations that even the most indulgent
to facebook,

46
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:06,060
a patron,
a under 21 is seeking something that's

47
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,870
of value,
something of worth,

48
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:12,250
something that will last something that
is permanent and even transforming.

49
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,980
And I think that has to do,
for example,

50
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:16,790
with the fascination with,
with,

51
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,650
uh,
a science fiction with a myth and

52
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:23,230
fantasy.
It's the Harry Potter thing.

53
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,430
It's looking for something that is
ultimately true and good.

54
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,510
They are not willing to buy a,
the rather grim,

55
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,150
a valueless,
godless,

56
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,530
spiritualists,
a universe which some of the elders are

57
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:43,531
quite prepared to sell them.
And I think that that suggests a,

58
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,410
a great hunger desire,
great spiritual movement,

59
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,340
uh,
among the cleverest and most able of

60
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,570
young people they know better than to be
content with less than a less than the

61
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,550
best.
And that's what they're seeking.
