1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,840
Um,
I think they are friends.

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,440
Um,
I think what's troubling to the American

3
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:15,441
Jewish community troubling to me is I
think there's been a change of strategy.

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,620
And I think that comes as a result of
the fact that,

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,490
um,
the United States today is facing a

6
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:26,220
major challenge in the world.
It's not Russia,

7
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:28,410
it's not China,
it's not Chavez.

8
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:29,244
It's,
um,

9
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,080
it's the Arab Muslim world.
We're at war America's at war with two

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,050
Muslim countries.
We baby at warroad a third.

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,870
Um,
not all Muslims are terrorists,

12
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:44,871
but most artists are Muslims.
It's a major challenge for the U S and,

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,030
um,
I think what we're seeing in this

14
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:52,680
administration is an effort to deal with
it.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,400
And I think part of that effort is this
notion of linkage that if you could only

16
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:03,510
solve the Arab Israel conflict,
Messiah will come in the Middle East.

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,960
And it's that notion,
that analysis that is motivating

18
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:10,410
American policy.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,480
And so,
um,

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,660
yeah I think friends,
but I think when the president went to

21
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:20,661
the Middle East is stumble Cairo Rehab
three times he was in a neighborhood of

22
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:23,610
Jerusalem,
didn't visit Jerusalem,

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,600
sent the wrong message,
sent a message that we're reaching out

24
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:31,980
to the Arab Muslim world at the expense
of our friendship or relationship with

25
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:34,680
Israel.
I've been focusing on settlements

26
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:39,681
without focusing on Palestinian
incitement and stuff was another

27
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,300
mistake.
So I think what we're seeing is a policy

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,840
which sees itself distancing the United
States from Israel in order to reach out

29
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,250
and in some manner to the Arab Muslim
world.

30
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,090
I don't think it's worked.
And so many of the Jewish community have

31
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:05,091
been concerned that this nuance or non
nuance changed as is as is.

32
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,070
And I believe as I indicated earlier,
is hurting prospects.

33
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:13,950
That piece,
cause if Israel does not feel that it's

34
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:17,550
only ally continues to be its friend
event,

35
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,050
it will not risk.

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,590
It will not compromise to the extent
that it has.

37
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,800
And if you take a look at it,
and during the Bush administration,

38
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:30,720
whether you like Bush or not,
the first president to come out for a

39
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:35,070
Palestinian state with Bush.
Why?

40
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,160
Because Israel trusted him.
And,

41
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,220
uh,
Sharon trusted him to the point that

42
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:43,960
when,
when President Bush announced appellate

43
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,520
that America's for a Palestinian state,
prime minister,

44
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,820
Sharon leftist political party because
they were opposed,

45
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,720
um,
disengagement from Gaza happened under

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,940
Bush,
um,

47
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,790
the Annapolis.
So when it's closer,

48
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:03,510
now we have no talks and in Palestinians
and Israelis are talking through

49
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:06,510
proximity,
which is their 15 kilometers away,

50
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:09,720
nine miles away.
And I've got to talk through the United

51
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:09,720
States.
