1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,710
Information over consumption is what a
lot of people think.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,680
They mean when they say information
overload.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,820
And that information over consumption
makes a lot more sense,

4
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:13,140
right?
We don't say that someone's suffering

5
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:14,760
from food overload.
It's not like,

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,400
you know,
fried chickens are offing themselves

7
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:21,750
than jumping into deep fryer fryers and
some undead Zombie chicken flies out of

8
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:24,540
the deep fryer and into our mouths,
uh,

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,030
for us to eat that.
Never that hasn't happened to my

10
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:28,200
knowledge.
And if it does,

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,570
well then we're in the middle of the
chicken apocalypse.

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,010
And that's problematic.
Sometimes I laugh at my own jokes,

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,250
but information over consumption is
really the right frame for us to,

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,910
to look at things through.
We have to take responsibility both for

15
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:49,620
the supply and the demand of information
and our role as a,

16
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:52,020
as a consumer and a supplier of this
stuff.

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,450
In the world of food,
for instance,

18
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:57,360
we have industrialized agriculture,
right?

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,490
And as we industrialize agriculture,
we created large corporations who have a

20
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:06,690
fiduciary responsibility to produce
cheap and popular calories.

21
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,190
And what that means is that they go,
well,

22
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:14,250
what is it that people want?
And now we've made it so that you can

23
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:19,050
have a pizza with everything on it
delivered to your house for $15 and a

24
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,140
half hour made from all kinds of
different things from all kinds of

25
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:25,320
different places.
This is as much of a feat of science and

26
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:28,590
my mind is putting a man on the moon if
you really sort of think about what it

27
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:31,860
takes in order to do that.
And I think the same thing has gone on

28
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:35,070
with information.
We've industrialized media are media

29
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:38,430
companies now have a fiduciary
responsibility to produce cheap and

30
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:42,330
popular information.
And that's led us down the road of Glenn

31
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,580
Beck and Sarah Pailin and Keith
Olbermann and,

32
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,430
and uh,
Rachel maddow who don't really want to

33
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:48,300
inform us.

34
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,080
They want to affirm us.
They want to tell us what it is that we

35
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:53,070
want.
I mean,

36
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,250
think about this for a second.
Who wants to hear the truth when they

37
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,290
can hear that they're right.
I certainly don't.

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,650
I love being affirmed.
I love being told that I'm right and I

39
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:04,890
certainly like that a lot more than I
like being informed.

40
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,360
And I think that's a important to
realize when we talk about this supply

41
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:13,500
and demand problem of blaming the victim
is that we're wired for what was good

42
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:17,160
for us and not necessarily what is good
for us and our producers are producing

43
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:20,400
what was good for us but not necessarily
what is good for us.

44
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,150
So I don't want to blame the victim,
but I do want us to start waking up and

45
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:27,300
realizing that this has a,
we have to have a conscious level of

46
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:30,750
consumption when it comes to information
and take your information.

47
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,750
Diet is an ethical choice of yours.
So when you're on the Huffington post

48
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:39,600
looking at,
say the Kardashians and you click on the

49
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:41,640
Kardashians,
uh,

50
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,050
understand that you are not only reading
that article,

51
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:50,610
but you're also voting for that article.
You're telling an editor to produce more

52
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:54,000
content like that at the expense of the
stuff that you didn't click on.

53
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,710
And so we have this sort of rapid
innovation of the tyranny of majority,

54
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,000
if you will.
Because of that,

55
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:04,570
because we are constantly being given
what it is that we want,

56
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,210
not necessarily what it is that we need.
I think that's vital to understand that

57
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,840
there's a difference between those two
things.

58
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:12,070
But in the world of food,
right,

59
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:16,030
if we were only given what we want,
what will we look like?

60
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,790
We'd be what we'd look like,
kind of like what we do today,

61
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,940
which we're,
we're about 35% of Americans are obese.

62
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,520
And I think the same thing's going on
with information.

63
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,460
I don't want people to come to,
to really focus on consuming less.

64
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,820
Uh,
just like,

65
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,740
I think appropriate nutrition shouldn't
be focused on consuming less.

66
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,980
Uh,
it should be about consuming well and

67
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:41,350
being healthy about your information
consumption.

68
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,401
And,
uh,

69
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:44,290
that's,
that's where I'd like to see us go.

70
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,800
That's what I'd like to see us do is
start building healthy frameworks for

71
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,710
information consumption.
And sometimes that means reducing it.

72
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:53,710
Sometimes that means increasing and
sometimes that means subtracting some of

73
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:55,270
the bad stuff and adding some of it gets
done.

74
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,160
Okay.
