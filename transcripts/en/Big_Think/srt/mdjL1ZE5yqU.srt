1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,550
Well,
I think this person does exist,

2
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:09,940
but it's really confined primarily to
the opposition party,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,280
to the supporters of the opposition
party.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,590
Um,
and we saw the same thing really,

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,960
um,
during the Bush administration,

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,150
uh,
particularly the last two years of the

7
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:22,630
Bush administration.
There were a lot of angry voters out

8
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:23,051
there,
but the,

9
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:23,980
at that time,
they were,

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,780
they were almost all democrats who were
upset about things like the war in Iraq,

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,250
uh,
about,

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,960
um,
Bush administration's,

13
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:34,030
you know,
economic and environmental policies and

14
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:37,300
so on.
Now with a Democratic president and

15
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:39,670
Congress,
it's the Republicans,

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,740
uh,
especially the more engaged Republicans

17
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:44,920
who are angry.
They're angry because they disagree,

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,580
you know,
with the Democrats on issues like

19
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,030
healthcare,
uh,

20
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,070
and budgetary priorities and so on.
So,

21
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:54,641
yes,
I mean,

22
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:56,470
I think there are angry voters that they
there.

23
00:00:56,471 --> 00:00:58,630
I think sometimes it gets a little
overblown,

24
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,880
you know,
because I'm not sure that,

25
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,770
um,
voters are really angry or overall now

26
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,930
than they have been in the past.
Um,

27
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,920
I think it's just that we're seeing more
visible manifestations of that with

28
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:13,420
these tea party demonstrations.

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,340
Well,
they're not angry anymore because now,

30
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,010
uh,
for the most part pick because you have

31
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:23,890
a democratic president.
Um,

32
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,270
now they,
um,

33
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,810
some of them might still not be thrilled
with all of the things the Obama

34
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:32,690
administration has done.
But by and large,

35
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:34,820
I think what you find is that there's
been a reversal,

36
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:35,980
you know,
that,

37
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,890
uh,
you know,

38
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,940
sort of like the,
the anger is gone over from one side to

39
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:41,060
the,
to the other,

40
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,290
not right now,
you know,

41
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,920
because again,
it's harder I think for people to get

42
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:52,560
worked up when,
you know,

43
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:54,960
they're in the majority,
um,

44
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,590
that especially in midterm elections,
we tend to see that it's the disgruntled

45
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,890
people who are the most active.
We saw that in 2006 where it was really

46
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:08,390
the Democrats by and large,
who are the most enthusiastic,

47
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,650
most engaged.
Um,

48
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,010
and now it's,
uh,

49
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,140
the Republicans,
you know,

50
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:14,880
with a Democrat in the White House.
Uh,

51
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,020
so it's sort of part of the normal cycle
of American politics.

52
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:22,170
That's what tends to happen in these,
in these midterm elections.

53
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:24,240
It's just that with increasing
polarization,

54
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,520
you know,
I think what happens now is that these

55
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,040
swings become greater,
um,

56
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,340
and the reaction becomes even stronger.

57
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,900
Okay.
