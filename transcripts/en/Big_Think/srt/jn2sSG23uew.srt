1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,040
That would be a little hard to say.
But when I was eight years old,

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,460
my grandfather died and I knew that he
had written poetry because I used to see

3
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:22,760
him writing poetry in his box and I was
very close to him.

4
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,970
And uh,
after he died,

5
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:30,971
I went down to the basement of my family
house where my family kept books,

6
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:33,770
anthologies and things.
And there was an anthology without any

7
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:38,390
names attached to an,
I read a poem called spellbound.

8
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,400
And I somehow attached it to my
grandfather's death.

9
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:45,890
And I,
I thought my grandfather had written it.

10
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,050
In fact,
I was sure he had written it.

11
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:53,060
And it was a great constellation to me
and something planted in my mind that

12
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:56,390
you could write poetry,
that you could read poetry.

13
00:00:56,391 --> 00:01:00,110
The portrait could somehow console you.
I didn't sit down then and start writing

14
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:01,970
poems,
but it was in the back of my mind.

15
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,290
Now when I was in high school,
I was leafing through an anthology that

16
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,410
our teachers had given us.
And I found it a poem.

17
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:10,580
I go,
that's so strange.

18
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:12,680
This,
this poem looks so much like my

19
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:16,940
grandfather's poem that I looked for
another one GRANDPA's poem.

20
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,080
It turns out it had been written by
Emily Bronte and it wasn't my

21
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,530
grandfather's poem at wall,
although my response to it I think was

22
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:27,320
pretty much the same.
I just had the author wrong.

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,740
Um,
but that was the beginning though.

24
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:33,340
I didn't start writing until I was in
high school and when I was in high

25
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:34,910
school,
I really began to,

26
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,680
I really began to write poetry with
great energy and enthusiasm.

27
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,360
I was in high school.
I used to show them to my sister and I

28
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:49,780
thought everything I wrote was so great.
And my poor sister,

29
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:52,450
who's a year younger than I am,
couldn't understand them at a wall,

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,420
but she was enthusiastic about my
writing them.

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,290
When I was a freshman in college,
I went to Grinnell College in Iowa.

32
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,950
I brought my poems to my freshman
humanities teacher whose name was Carol

33
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,200
Parson,
a wonderful teacher.

34
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,990
And Carol did a really great thing for
me.

35
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:10,060
She's,
she taught me more than anyone.

36
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,430
She somehow read my poems and came back
to me and convinced me that I could be a

37
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:17,230
poet,
that I had the passion and the

38
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:20,950
enthusiasm and the creativity to become
a poet.

39
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:25,390
But that what I was writing was not
poetry because I was just expressing my

40
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:27,820
feelings and I wasn't trying to make
anything.

41
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,930
The oldest word for,
for poetry and Greek is pollicis,

42
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:36,010
which means making a poet as a maker and
a poem as a made thing.

43
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,940
And Carol Somehow convinced me that I
could become a poet,

44
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,090
but that I was not writing poetry.
And then I would have to try and make

45
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:44,770
something,
um,

46
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:50,190
to write poetry and that I started then
to try and shape something rather than

47
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:54,220
just express it.
And when I started to shape something

48
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:57,910
and to imitate other poems that were
written by other people,

49
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,640
when I tried to integrate reading and my
writing,

50
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,290
I was on my payoff.
I guess that would have been 1968 I was

51
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,140
a freshman in college and I,
I wasn't writing good poems,

52
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:09,700
but I was at least trying to write
poems.

53
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:14,701
Then
there has been no poet,

54
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,200
no great poet in the history of poetry
who hasn't also been a great reader of

55
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:23,140
poetry.
This is sometimes distressing to my

56
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:26,320
students when I tell them this.
Now I do say it's possible.

57
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,320
You might be the first,
I'm not saying it's impossible,

58
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,600
but the odds are very much against you.

59
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,430
All great poets have been great readers.
And the way to learn your craft in

60
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:41,431
poetry is by reading other poetry and by
letting it guide you a great model for

61
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:47,821
this is the way that Dante calls on
Virgil at the beginning of the inferior.

62
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:50,350
No,
um,

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,800
the divine comedy to help guide them
through the underworld and in a way

64
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,550
that's also a recognition that Dante
needs virgil and that the infare inferno

65
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:10,291
needs the Aeneid and that the epic needs
a model and that for Dante to write this

66
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:14,410
great poem,
he needs someone to come before him and

67
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:18,460
he turns to Virgil's taxed,
especially books six where in the US

68
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:22,630
goes down into the underworld.
And for me that's a model of the poets

69
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:24,910
relationship to a pre to previous
poetry,

70
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,970
to another poetry as a,
as calling out for guidance.

71
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,740
There are many poets that I use as my
models.

72
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,770
Um,
in my first book of poems,

73
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,920
um,
I had several for the sleepwalkers,

74
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,840
I had several poems that were apprentice
poems like this in which I take a walk

75
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:50,760
with a,
with a,

76
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,770
with a poet who's no longer alive.
One of them as I walk with Federico

77
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,750
Garcia Lorca around the upper west side
in Manhattan because that was a

78
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:03,190
neighborhood he lived in.
And I imagine walking around Paris with

79
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:06,460
Cesar via whole Great Peruvian poet who
lived in Paris.

80
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,800
And,
uh,

81
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,260
I kind of,
I create the walk as a kind of drama of

82
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,960
my apprenticeship.
Now,

83
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:17,320
it is true that I think one of the
things that distinguished my work from

84
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:21,010
the beginning when I was in college was
my turning towards poetry from other

85
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:24,670
countries that I didn't ever consider
poetry.

86
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,260
The province exclusively of English and
American literature.

87
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,440
And I discovered a great amount in
reading,

88
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:36,430
Polish poetry and other eastern European
poetry and reading Russian poetry and

89
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:38,590
reading Latin American and Spanish
poetry.

90
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,100
And I've always found models in those
other poetry's of poets who could help

91
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:46,120
me on my payoff.

92
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,770
I think it shapes it in very deep ways
that you don't entirely understand.

93
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,710
Um,
Rainer Maria Rocha said there are two

94
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,560
sources for poetry.
One is dreams and the other is

95
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,710
childhood.
And I think childhood is an

96
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:08,711
inexhaustible source of your becoming
who you will be and certain deep

97
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:14,891
feelings are set inside of you a certain
construct of emotions that really define

98
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:20,621
who you are and who you will become.
And I feel very much that my childhood

99
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:24,140
is very alive inside of me,
very close to me,

100
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:29,141
very much part of me.
And I'm at an a sometimes painful,

101
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:34,541
sometimes joyous in exhaustible resource
for poetry and a lot of portraits.

102
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:39,650
Putting yourself back into the state of
wonder that you have before things when

103
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:42,440
you're a child,
it's not only a joyous wonder,

104
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:45,170
it's sometimes a grief stricken wonder.
Um,

105
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,370
I have,
uh,

106
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:51,370
the idea that lyric poetry is a poetry
that's driven by a sense of the presence

107
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,204
of death.

108
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,890
That there's something unbearable about
the fact that we're going to die and

109
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:01,370
that we can't stand it.
And I think you find that out in

110
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:05,060
childhood and you don't really,
at least I found that out in childhood

111
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,020
and I found that hard to get over.
And now I'm 60 years old and I still

112
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:11,960
find it hard to get over.
And I think it's one of the things that

113
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:15,710
drive lyric poetry,
our sense of mortality,

114
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,070
our sense that things are transient,
that everything is passing.

115
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,600
And then if you want to save something
from the endless flux of experience,

116
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,060
um,
and the world's movement,

117
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:31,190
you have to set down a steak and try and
make something that will last.
