1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,060
If I could rework the entire business
model of Google,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,560
I would get google to charge for their
search engine.

3
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:11,340
I think it's an outstanding product.
I acknowledge that.

4
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:14,100
I'll say it publicly.
I use it all the time too much.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,370
I don't have a google account.
I'm very careful about that.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,540
I don't have a gmail account and I don't
sign into google when I use the google

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,210
search,
but Google still knows me because I'm

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,850
really only on one or two computers.
If they're watching,

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,200
uh,
they will,

10
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:29,130
uh,
they will know.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,410
A Google of course is always watching.
Um,

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,510
but the way to solve that is that
google,

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,050
the google search,
the google or the Google products are

14
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:42,740
free,
which means that they have to read that

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,820
their revenue is derived from
advertising.

16
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,240
The alternative would be to charge me
$10 a month,

17
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:51,090
say for all I can eat on the Google
search.

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,270
And in exchange for that,
they would say,

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,770
we will promise never to look at you
the,

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,520
there'd be no cookies,
no ways that they can survey what we're

21
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,460
doing.
They would do away with themselves as a

22
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:07,560
big data company.
The same is true of facebook.

23
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:11,520
I don't have a facebook account,
not because facebook's or bad product in

24
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:12,840
some way.
I think it's creepy,

25
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,430
but only because of that data practices.
If the facebook product was offered for

26
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:21,420
10 or $15 a month or whatever the price
was like spotify is,

27
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,490
it would be a much more attractive
model.

28
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:27,690
So I think that that is the challenge.
I'm not the only person to think in

29
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:29,850
these terms.
Ethan Zimmerman,

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,150
um,
who is a fellow at the Berkman Center

31
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:38,151
and one of the most articulate sort of
evangelists for the Internet,

32
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:42,360
at least at the beginning,
argues now that the free business model

33
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:47,361
was the original sin of the Internet.
And I think Ethan's choice of Biblical

34
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:50,250
language is appropriate.
It wasn't original sin,

35
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,270
it's corrupted everything else.
So I want to see Google charge for their

36
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:58,440
services and I think that they could
still be an incredibly viable company

37
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,690
after all,
what's wrong with paying with stuff?

38
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,640
Uh,
before this interview,

39
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,700
I paid for my lunch.
I paid for my taxi cab.

40
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,570
I didn't exchange my data for it.
That economy has worked well for

41
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:12,510
hundreds of years.
This new economy is creepy.

42
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,020
It's corrupted by the original sin of
swapping wonderful technology for data.
