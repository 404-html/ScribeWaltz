1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
We learned from a very early age to make
our sense of self worth conditional upon

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,620
some kind of external criteria which can
be judged by others because of this,

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,250
self compassionate becomes a challenge
because self compassion requires a

4
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:22,251
natural ability on your part to be able
to deal with your failures as well as

5
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:26,160
success with understanding,
acceptance and kindness.

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,320
The problem that I see with the self
esteem movement particularly is that

7
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:34,050
self esteem movement,
again,

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,160
you know,
kind of plays into this tendency to make

9
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:41,100
your sense of worth conditional upon
what you achieve.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,450
Uh,
and,

11
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,450
and,
and inevitably that involves comparison

12
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:46,920
with others.
And,

13
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,010
and you know,
there's also a moral problem there

14
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:52,530
because in order to boost yourself as
team,

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,680
sometimes you need to put down in your
mind the self compassion doesn't require

16
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:01,890
any of that.
What self compassion is suggesting is

17
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:05,610
that you should be able to do the same
thing that you normally do to someone

18
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:07,800
that you can towards yourself.

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,140
And the beauty of that is that once you
have that kind of ability to relate to

20
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:15,900
your own situation,
situation with kindness,

21
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,290
it creates a kind of a reservoir of
strength and resilience so that you have

22
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,120
planted to draw from.
Because otherwise,

23
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:29,121
if your compassion has always other
directed and you do not take care of

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,540
your own needs and your own wellbeing,
at some point,

25
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,600
this kind of leads to compassion
fatigue.

26
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,040
And even in some cases when the
relationship does not work and when

27
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,820
there is not enough recognition from
coming from the other,

28
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,060
the recipient side,
you might even feel betrayed and let

29
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:52,080
down and used and ultimately even
feeling bitterness.

30
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,470
So having a greater base of self
compassion really buffers against all of

31
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:03,891
these potentially negative consequences
of being always too much other focused.
