1
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,840
What keeps them up at night in the
positive way is the possibility that we

2
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:17,200
might contribute to the development of
human culture in a way that,

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,180
you know,
years from now,

4
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:24,181
people who will never know our names may
be able to live more empowered lives.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,410
And you know,
if you asked like,

6
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,080
what is the name of your great,
great,

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,960
great grandfather,
you probably don't even know if he got

8
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:35,080
three or four greats out.
So it's not that we're mortal,

9
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:36,940
we're going to dive very,
very soon.

10
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,730
It's not that what we produce is going
to live on,

11
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:42,700
it will not.
But the changes that we can make in the

12
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:47,170
culture can be there for people we will
never meet.

13
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,410
We'll never know us.
And that's what keeps me up at night.

14
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:53,440
It's what excites me about science,
that we can learn,

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,440
uh,
ways of being with each other.

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,460
And the behavioral sciences have not
been enough of a part of cultural

17
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:03,550
development.
The physical sciences have behavioral

18
00:01:03,551 --> 00:01:08,050
sciences have not.
And I would like to see if we can bring

19
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:13,030
some things into human culture that
would humanize and soften and empower

20
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:18,031
people or keeps you up at night in a
negative way is if we don't solve these

21
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:23,920
problems of the human heart and of the
human head of human psychology,

22
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,460
there is no technological solutions so
great that it can prevent the world that

23
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:35,011
is coming in a world of suitcase bombs
or have the ability to pollute the

24
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:40,360
planet in a way that it cannot recover a
of global warming and the rest we've

25
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:44,950
created through science and technology,
a different world that has frightening

26
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:49,840
sides to it and psychology and
behavioral science has to be part of

27
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:54,841
this because if you take something like
the so called war on terrorism by the,

28
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,540
if we go out another 20 years and it
doesn't just planes into buildings,

29
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:04,120
but it's a suitcase bomb in the middle
of New York,

30
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,010
there's not enough soldiers and there's
not enough bullets to kill enough people

31
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,180
to make us safe.

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,080
I think we're going to have to find a
way to humanize the culture itself and

33
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:19,630
it isn't just them.
It's us when we fly buildings,

34
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,640
uh,
up fly planes,

35
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,460
over countries,
dropping bombs on the evil ones.

36
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,570
I think we're doing something very
similar to what's being done when the

37
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:32,620
infidels are getting their comeuppance
with planes going into buildings.

38
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,670
So it's,
it's gotten to the point where if we are

39
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:40,600
not healthy psychologically as a human
society,

40
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,850
we will not have a planet to live on.
And that's what keeps me up at night

41
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,910
when I see so little focus on the
behavioral side of these problems and

42
00:02:56,201 --> 00:03:01,120
the idea that just politics or,
or just science is going to solve this

43
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,970
or just the military.
It's not true.

44
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,350
We have to solve this and we've got to
solve it in our own heads and in our own

45
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:10,210
hearts,
one at a time.

46
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:14,200
And I think psychotherapy actually tells
us a little bit about what we might need

47
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:19,150
to do to soften the culture and make it
more possible for us to live together as

48
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,470
human beings on this planet.
