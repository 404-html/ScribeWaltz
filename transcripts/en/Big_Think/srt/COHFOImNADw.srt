1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,170
I suppose the obvious analogy for Obama
would be Richard,

2
00:00:06,321 --> 00:00:07,790
the second,
I don't buy it myself.

3
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:10,340
I think Obama a stronger president than
Richard.

4
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:15,050
The second was a king,
but a man who is perhaps politically

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,700
naive who is perhaps too cerebral for,
uh,

6
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:24,110
the world of sorted politics.
You could make a case for it.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,800
I could see Obama as hamlet,
a man given to great cerebral

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,910
self-examination,
who finally realizes he has to act.

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,020
I don't see Obama's Richard the third,
the way a lot of people cast Richard

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,170
Nixon is Richard the third.
I don't seem Obama as Nick Beth,

11
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:46,260
although I think Macbeth,
when you go back to it,

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,290
is every ambitious person or at least
someone with the grains of ambition who

13
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:57,050
can be manipulated by an ambitious
person that you've ever known.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,130
I'm,
the thing for me about Shakespeare is

15
00:00:59,131 --> 00:00:59,511
that,
you know,

16
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:01,580
you see these people standing around the
water cooler.

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,110
I work with a dozen he yorkers.

18
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,580
Yeah.
