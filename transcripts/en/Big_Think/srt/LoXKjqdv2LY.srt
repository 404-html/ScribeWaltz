1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,283
Hmm.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,690
The so called liberal argument,
which is probably more liberal today

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,900
than it has been in many,
many decades.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,970
Um,
you know,

5
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:17,550
they argue that we should have equal
equality.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,820
Everybody should be equal.
We should all make the same amount of

7
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,250
money.
We should all have the same assets and

8
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:25,050
well,
I don't believe that.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,820
I think that's fundamentally inimical to
free market capitalism.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,690
I think that's a kind of Soviet,
uh,

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,690
East Europe,
you know,

12
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:37,190
old communist socialist model that has
never worked you,

13
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:41,360
you can't make anybody everybody equal.
They tried to redistrict it,

14
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:45,600
redistribute income and wealth rather
than increase it.

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,950
Um,
my credo here is instead of making the

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,420
economic pie smaller and handling
smaller pieces to everyone,

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,800
let's make the pie bigger and get
everybody a larger piece.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,780
And I think history has proven really
since the fall of Soviet communism that

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,520
that model of income leveling is a bad
model.

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,970
It's a mild does work.
It took seven years for the Soviets to

21
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,410
felt fall,
but they fell.

22
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,200
And China,
for example,

23
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,110
the other big communist country,
I won't say that they've fallen,

24
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,190
but they've changed their economy.
It's now much more of a market oriented

25
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:26,910
economy in my judgment.
Markets distribute goods,

26
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,690
market set prices,
and if there are free opportunities

27
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:34,200
inside markets,
that's how people who work hard will do

28
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:37,830
well.
And I think the ethos in America is to

29
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,610
work hard.
That's always been where we are.

30
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,400
In other words,
we all start at the same beginning.

31
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,540
The starting line is the same.
By law and tradition,

32
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,850
we should be prejudice,
free,

33
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,920
color free,
gender free,

34
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,080
whatever.
We all have the same legal starting

35
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:58,230
line,
but that doesn't mean we all finish at

36
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:01,800
the finish line at the same.
And I think that's human nature.

37
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,600
So we talk about this in the book and in
particular as you asked about,

38
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,370
uh,
tax policy,

39
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,970
taxing rich people at high confiscatory
rates has never worked in this country.

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,890
It's outside of our tradition.
It's been tried a couple of times.

41
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,150
Um,
FDR tried it 1930s and it didn't work

42
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,590
and the economy was no better in the
late thirties than it was when he took

43
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:30,500
over in 1932.
Um,

44
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,840
the war spending did help,
but the great new deal experiment failed

45
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,820
the great times of prosperity in this
country.

46
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:44,430
It's so when we lower tax rates and we
shrank government,

47
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:48,300
we put government in a lesser position.
I'm a believer in the private sector.

48
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,390
The government does not run the economy.
We run the economy.

49
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,810
So you go back and look at some
unbelievable prosperity periods like the

50
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:59,370
post civil war period.
Unbelievable.

51
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,010
The 1920s,
unbelievable prosperity,

52
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,190
the 1960s,
unbelievable.

53
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,750
The 1980s and nineties,
fantastic economic growth.

54
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,680
Those all have some common
characteristics and usually they include

55
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,380
low marginal tax rates.
So you keep more of what you earn.

56
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,650
That's a reward for your work and
investment and entrepreneurship.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,330
Uh,
less government,

58
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,630
fewer regulations.
That doesn't mean no government.

59
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:34,000
It doesn't mean no regulations.
I'm for a safety net,

60
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,260
but it means at some point you go too
far and you're strangling businesses.

61
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,380
You're strangling small businesses.
And that's who I'm really worried about.

62
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,680
So that's my basic argument.
John F.

63
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,480
Kennedy,
to get right to the chase in this book,

64
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,220
John F Kennedy's tax cut legacy has been
lost.

65
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,820
It's a very strange story and that's one
of the reasons why Brian Dimitra rich

66
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,790
and I wrote this book.
Kennedy was the first post World War II

67
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,620
supply side tax cutting president.
He was the first Eisenhower wouldn't do

68
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,450
it.
And the 1950s,

69
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,570
despite certain urban legends,
the 1950s where allows the economy three

70
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,580
recessions,
and in eight or nine years,

71
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,910
Kennedy knew
having one by a cat's whisker against

72
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:24,610
Nixon.
Kennedy knew that he had to grow the

73
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:26,740
American economy at 5% a year.

74
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,330
That was his target.
Nixon didn't go there and Kennedy never

75
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:36,331
really told us in the 1960 election how
he was going to grow at five,

76
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,990
but he said,
this is what we're going to do.

77
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,830
And then he went back and forth with his
advisors in 1961 and 1962 the first step

78
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:50,170
he made was one I disagree with.
He had a lot of government spending lots

79
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:52,540
and lots of government spending,
safety net spending,

80
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,070
infrastructure spending,
you name it,

81
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,490
which is liberal academic advisors.
Um,

82
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,340
uh,
suggested to him that was their idea,

83
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,330
spend,
spend and leave tax rates high.

84
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,440
You know,
at the top tax rate was 91%.

85
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,580
It's inconceivable.
So you earn an extra dollar,

86
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,320
you get 9 cents,
but government gets the rest.

87
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,370
That's a big number.
That's a big number.

88
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,520
So anyway,
make a long story short or at least this

89
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:25,240
part of the story.

90
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,980
Short,
Kennedy had several Republicans in his

91
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:31,960
cabinet.
This is an interesting side note,

92
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,190
but very important for today.
One of them was a guy named Douglas

93
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,800
Dillon who came from a famous banking
family.

94
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,720
Uh,
just like get Kennedy.

95
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,750
He has as much money as JFK,
his father and his banking guy and owned

96
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:49,990
the vineyard in south of France.
He was Eisenhower's under secretary of

97
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:50,830
state.
Anyway,

98
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,070
Kennedy puts him in the top tier
Treasury Department and Dylan makes the

99
00:05:56,621 --> 00:06:01,621
argument that the liberals were wrong
and instead we should give men and women

100
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,220
more opportunities,
more rewards,

101
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,520
more incentives to grow the economy.
If you get paid more,

102
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,850
you're likely to work more.
Or if the tax rate is lower on

103
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:23,951
investment for a new business,
if you are rewarded with higher pay

104
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,910
after tax,
you're going to be rejuvenated.

105
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,800
You're going to get out there and go for
the gold.

106
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,760
And that hasn't been happening since
World War II hadn't happened in the

107
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,010
1950s.
Uh,

108
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,520
it was just throughout one number for
it.

109
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,110
It's in that book at 91% tax rate.
So as I said,

110
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,420
you make a,
you make an extra dollar,

111
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,100
you get 9 cents,
right?

112
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,400
The government gets a 91 cents.
Now,

113
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Ronald Reagan as a movie actor quit
acting because he decided 9 cents on the

114
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:00,680
dollar was not enough for him to
motivate him.

115
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,180
True Story.
Um,

116
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,320
Kennedy cut the top tax rate from 91 to
70.

117
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,800
So instead of taking home 9 cents on the
dollar,

118
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,280
you took home 30 cents on the dollar.
That's an over 200% increase.

119
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,810
And after tax income,
and Kennedy argued he was the pioneer

120
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,500
and I Reagan Kennedy,
that this will create opportunities and

121
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:30,050
incentives.
They'll get government out of the way.

122
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,790
It'll get people work at harder.
It'll get them to take risks to start

123
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:35,624
new companies.

124
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,520
Um,
a lot of new companies,

125
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:41,750
a lot of technology and silicon valley
stuff was started in the 60s,

126
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,550
uh,
after the Kennedy tax cuts.

127
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,130
That was his argument.
And then 20 years later,

128
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,900
the top rate was at 70,
and Reagan cut it the 28 and two steps,

129
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,760
1981,
1986,

130
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:55,790
28.
So now instead of getting 30 cents on

131
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:59,510
the dollar,
you got 72 cents on the dollar.

132
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,920
It's about 145% increased.
That's what I call reward.

133
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,610
That's a basic economic principle.
We don't work to finance the government,

134
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,050
we don't work.
Uh,

135
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,560
unless we are compensated for the hard
work,

136
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,220
we might go on welfare,
but that's not going to necessarily help

137
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:20,540
the country.
It helps the poor.

138
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,630
But we want less poverty.
We want more opportunity.

139
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,530
So give us more after tax income.
That's what Kennedy did.

140
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:29,840
It's called an incentive.
That's what Reagan did and it's called

141
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:32,540
and a Saturday and both times it worked.

142
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,610
That's the thing.
Kennedy,

143
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:37,430
the Democrat,
a lot of people said he was a liberal

144
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:38,151
democrat.
Actually.

145
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,500
He was not.
He was very conservative.

146
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:42,560
But Kenny,
the Democrats using a Republican

147
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:45,380
treasury secretary,
Doug Dawn Reagan,

148
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,320
20 something years later,
the Republican,

149
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,650
okay,
who wound Democrats in Congress to get

150
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:56,550
his tax cuts through.
They presided over the best economic

151
00:08:56,551 --> 00:09:01,470
decades postwar.
And it is not a coincidence that they

152
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:04,530
both were tax cutters and we can talk
about this later,

153
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,610
but they also wanted a steady and strong
reliable dollar as our currency.

154
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,940
But incentives matter.
The government does not run our,

155
00:09:12,941 --> 00:09:17,280
our economy.
We run our economy as long as we are

156
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:22,140
properly rewarded for our efforts and
our entrepreneurship and Soviet Union.

157
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,850
The Soviets,
randy economy,

158
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,310
it was horrible,
horrible,

159
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,590
rampid poverty.
China is horrible.

160
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,780
East Europe,
horrible Latin America,

161
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:33,930
horrible.
And then came the free market revolution

162
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,380
and things picked up quite a bit because
people had more economic freedom.

163
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,360
And that's why I argue this,
uh,

164
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,300
I'm not even,
I'm not talking politics here.

165
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:47,301
I'm just talking straight out economics.
1970s Republicans and Democrats

166
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,770
destroyed the currency,
created double digit inflation and

167
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:57,030
raised taxes.
And the 70s were a horrible period of

168
00:09:57,031 --> 00:10:00,750
economic growth.
We had 12 15% inflation twice.

169
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,800
The economy barely grew.
And then Reagan came in and change that.

170
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:06,720
And by the way,
just to make sure,

171
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:10,020
this is bipartisan.
Bill Clinton,

172
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,580
Democrat,
he did raise the income tax in his first

173
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,790
year,
but then he came back a few years later

174
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,480
and cut the capital gains tax,
which is a very important task for

175
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:24,510
investors and risk takers,
and he acknowledged that he raised

176
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:27,960
income taxes too much.
Clinton was also a free trader.

177
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,300
I wouldn't say Clinton was Reagan's
third term,

178
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,340
but he's pretty close to Reagan's third
term.

179
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,260
Unfortunately,
today,

180
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,510
the Democratic Party's hope,
hopefully,

181
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,030
hopefully lost.
They won't go through this.

182
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,150
They want to tax wealthy people.
They want to punish success.

183
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,630
It's not the way America does it.
It's not the way success is created.
