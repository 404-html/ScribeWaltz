1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,860
Uh,
one of the interesting things about

2
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,890
urban culture the last half century is
that urban residents are increasingly

3
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,560
college educated,
smart people with a lot of cultural

4
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:26,120
capital.
They don't,

5
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:31,121
might not have a lot of money,
but they have had fairly good jobs and a

6
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:36,881
terrific interest in history and art and
what we could call the aesthetics of

7
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,970
city life.
So this made them look forward,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
the kinds of cities and the areas in
cities that had the cobblestone streets,

9
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,250
red brick or brownstone or graystone
houses,

10
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,820
and a small stores that could be
converted to the interesting quality of

11
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:08,150
life that they sought.
This is very different from their

12
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:13,151
parents' generation in the fifties or
sixties of the last century because

13
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:17,720
those people often try to escape urban
life,

14
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,080
which they saw as closed in and you
know,

15
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,160
tenements and crowded streets and over
imposing monolithic office towers for

16
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:30,440
the suburbs.
A lot of those people of the parents'

17
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:34,430
generation left the cities because they
thought the cities,

18
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:39,350
we're going to be poor and degraded,
but it's their children who have

19
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:44,351
returned to cities who have confirmed
the interest of city life.

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,080
But the more of them or of us who come
to cities for the less space there is

21
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:56,060
for the low income people who have been
living in cities all along.

22
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,660
So it's a curious kind of culture that
develops out of great appreciation for

23
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:08,021
the authentic city that has been here
and a a tendency to impose new tastes

24
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,720
that drive out longtime residents and
businesses.

25
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:24,060
The idea of authenticity really comes
from Shakespeare's time and Russo's

26
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:27,970
time.
A century later when,

27
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,990
uh,
people began to realize that,

28
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,310
uh,
there,

29
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:38,311
there is such a thing as an authentic
self that could thrive in a natural or

30
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:42,640
an authentic society.
Uh,

31
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,970
there haven't been too many completely
authentic societies,

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,240
but from the 17th and 18th centuries,
some groups of people have tried to

33
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,920
absent themselves from society to go to
a rural commune,

34
00:02:56,921 --> 00:03:00,550
let's say,
to found the utopia and sometimes even

35
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:05,080
to come to a,
a working class neighborhood to live

36
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:10,081
among people and live in surroundings
that they think will allow them to

37
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,850
create an authentic self.
So these are people who don't look for

38
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:20,851
certain kinds of fashions to demonstrate
their identity and they don't

39
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:24,490
necessarily join political groups or
social movements,

40
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,910
but they tried to live in a space that
they can identify with as,

41
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,490
uh,
an authentic space and an authentic

42
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:34,324
culture.

43
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,580
Sometimes it's neighborhoods like,
you know,

44
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:41,581
Bohemian districts of Paris in the late
19th century or Greenwich village,

45
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,610
a Bohemian district of New York in the
early 20th century.

46
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,770
But when those areas become two
conformist or too expensive,

47
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:56,070
those who seek an authentic life move
elsewhere so that the center of artistic

48
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,310
authenticity in New York moved from
Greenwich village to Brooklyn Heights in

49
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:09,510
the mid 20th century.
And also by the 1960s to the East

50
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:11,890
village,
which was not called the East village

51
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:14,470
then.
It was part of the lower east side.

52
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,630
But I guess an enterprising real estate
agent or developer said,

53
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,050
there are so many hippies living here
looking for,

54
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,900
you know,
for some kind of commune in the city

55
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:29,100
that I'll benefit by calling this area,
uh,

56
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,910
the East village and connected with the
old bohemianism of Greenwich Village.

57
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,300
And then by the 1990s,
the East village became very expensive,

58
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,350
partly because of the university
expansion nearby and partly because of

59
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:47,160
the attractiveness of,
um,

60
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,270
some of the,
uh,

61
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:54,390
some of the hippie and art destinations
that had been created during the 1980s.

62
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,800
So the center of authenticity then moved
across the East River on the,

63
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:02,470
uh,
on the subway to Williamsburg,

64
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,740
which then became a district of indie
music bands and bars and kind of edgy

65
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:11,200
performance spaces.
This,

66
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:14,770
this of course is a young sort of
authenticity.

67
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:18,850
It's different from the gentrification
of a more settled,

68
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:22,690
slightly older population.
So,

69
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,740
uh,
as,

70
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,810
as rents go up,
the,

71
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:30,811
the search for authenticity expands
looking for other areas of the city that

72
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,280
offer a kind of low down,
but truer sense of where the self can

73
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:40,540
develop.
