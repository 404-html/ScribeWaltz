00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,400
Intuition pumps are sometimes called
thought experiments more often they're

2
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:13,320
called thought experiments,
but they're not really formal arguments.

3
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,780
Typically their stories,
their little fables,

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,101
uh,
in fact,

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:21,120
I think they're similar to aesop's
fables and that they were supposed to

6
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,980
have a moral.
They're supposed to teach us something

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,550
and what they do is they lead the
audience to an intuition,

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,360
a conclusion where you sort of pound
your fist on the table and you say,

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,740
oh yeah,
it's got to be that way,

10
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:36,410
doesn't it?
And if it,

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,880
if it achieves that,
then it's pumped.

12
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:42,840
The intuition that was designed to pump
these are persuasion machines,

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,490
a little persuasion machines that
philosophers have been using for several

14
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,860
thousand years.
I think that intuition pumps are

15
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:54,660
particularly valuable when there's
confusion about what the right questions

16
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:58,110
are and what the right,
what matters,

17
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:00,000
what matters.
To answer the question,

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,520
I think we're all pretty good at using
examples too,

19
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,760
to think about things.

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,740
And intuition pumps are usually rather
vivid examples that are from which

21
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:15,741
you're supposed to draw a very general
moral and they come up in many walks of

22
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:20,670
life.
Anytime you're a puzzled or confused

23
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:23,970
about what to do next or whether
something's true or false,

24
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,270
you might cast about for an intuition
pump that could help you.

25
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,270
When I first coined determined intuition
pump,

26
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,870
it's when Doug Hofstadter and I were
working on the mind's eye,

27
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,880
which has lots of intuition,
pumps,

28
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:40,830
lots of thought experiments in it,
and Doug came up with a great metaphor.

29
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:42,750
He said,
what you want to do with any of these

30
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:44,850
intuition pumps is twittle all the
knobs.

31
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:46,980
Turn the knobs,
see what makes it work.

32
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,800
Now though,
this is actually something that we're

33
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:53,280
familiar with from other parts of our
lives.

34
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,030
If there's a gadget and you want to know
what it does,

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,580
turn the knobs to see what happens,
see what,

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,930
see what the moving parts.

37
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,180
Do a.
So I encourage

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,800
everybody to not not just to take an
intuition pump as it's handed to them,

39
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,860
but look at the moving part c,
see what makes it tick.

40
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:18,060
Try to figure out what if I adjust this?
Will it still pumped the same intuition?

41
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,060
Well,
it's still yield the same putative

42
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:23,130
conclusion or will the whole thing fall
apart?

43
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,350
And it's interesting to see that a lot
of times philosophers will make an

44
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:32,640
intuition pump,
which seems to do great work until you

45
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:36,870
start turning the knobs and then you
realize that it actually depends on.

46
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:40,590
You're not thinking clearly about some
aspect of the problem.

47
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,160
Then you've exposed it as as not a good
intuition pump,

48
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,550
but as actually a sort of negative one,
I call them boom crashes because they

49
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,850
explode in your face.
