1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,620
Every retail sales person in America
just secretly wants to get through life

2
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:07,080
without ever being accused of being a
pushy salesperson.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,700
Um,
and so the man in the desert story,

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,170
um,
you know,

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,910
guys,
there's a,

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,250
there's a silly a story in the world,
I mean,

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,900
until I made it up because it's so
silly,

8
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:21,690
but the guy is,
this guy lives on an oasis in the desert

9
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:26,691
and he looks out one day and there's
a man that's been obviously stranded in

10
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:28,550
the desert for days,
uh,

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,760
uh,
kind of,

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,750
kind of approaching a serious,
uh,

13
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,910
you know,
approaching death or something.

14
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,773
He's like,
well,

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,060
and so what happens in retail,
in the retail industry is people rush up

16
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:41,490
to him and give him a glass of water.
And then they,

17
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:44,070
um,
he drinks the water and they pat

18
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:46,800
themselves on the back and the man of
the desert wanders off some more and

19
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:48,000
they're feeling great about themselves.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,940
You know,
that one,

21
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,470
I got the guy a glass of water.
And so we,

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,320
there's so much more that you can do for
him.

23
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:59,160
You need to intuit his needs and you
know,

24
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:01,230
let's see.
He needs more than water.

25
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:03,150
He's been out there for days,
he needs food.

26
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,600
He,
he might need electrolytes,

27
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:09,540
not just a water.
So let's give him some gatorade or you

28
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:12,960
know,
he needs to call his family and let them

29
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:14,340
know that he's okay,
you know,

30
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,370
and,
and not to mention Aloe Vera and all of

31
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:19,980
that.
So you're really the man in the desert.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,460
You're fulfilling his needs.
Intuiting is nice and filling them,

33
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,130
uh,
through conversation and through it's

34
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:27,420
hard work.
Uh,

35
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,191
but you know,
you're,

36
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:29,310
you're,
you're doing all of that.

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,930
Then you can feel good about yourself.
Man and desert puts the moral imperative

38
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:37,080
if you will,
on selling rather than not selling

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,390
somebody that really understands the
mountain desert.

40
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,990
A story will understand that I'm selling
and service for the same thing.

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,370
We're not training people to sell up,
sell this.

42
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,040
Just help them in the true sense of the
word.

43
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,710
Just help the customer and the true
sense of the word.

44
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,540
And um,
you can only help the customer and help

45
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,900
the company or you can hurt the customer
and hurt the company if you went out and

46
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:09,300
give them a glass of water,
then you're just kind of wimping out

47
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:11,790
because you're afraid of being seen as a
pushy salesperson.

48
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,910
You're hurting the customer and in
you're hurting the company.

49
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,520
So if there's a woman in the container
store,

50
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,840
closet section and she's got a tie rack
in one hand in a shoe rack and the other

51
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:25,050
hand,
I mean she obviously has a closet

52
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:29,760
somewhere that's driving her crazy and,
and you can conclude that fairly safely

53
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,850
and if you let her get out of there with
those two items,

54
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,130
she's still got to have a closet,
was driving her crazy,

55
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:37,290
but the ties and the shoes will be a
little bit better off,

56
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,660
which you can do is,
you know,

57
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,910
causing interaction with her to find it
and,

58
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,500
and take a complete closet approach to
really kind of redoing her whole closet.

59
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,980
And what that will usually lead up to is
a customer that's vastly happier because

60
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:56,460
she got a problem solved.
She got her car and she's dancing in the

61
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:59,160
closet because it's so perfect.
That's what we're trying to get.

62
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,480
We're trying to get what we call the
customer dance.

63
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,610
Then you have a really delighted
customer who's coming back quickly who's

64
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,770
so delighted with her closet that she's
showing,

65
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,130
um,
her sister in law and her next door

66
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:14,650
neighbor that closet and then they're
coming in because they want,

67
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,310
they want that feeling too,
and they're like emotionally thrilled

68
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:21,490
with this closet or pantry or toys
towards solution or whatever.

69
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,090
And that's how we build our business and
an old market or a new market.

70
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,690
And ultimately what people want is they
want to feel emotional about the brands,

71
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,630
about the prototype,
this stuff home.

72
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,860
And they live with it for a very long
time and they either cus you every time

73
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:40,870
they see it or they smile and they were
very,

74
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,950
very happy about it.

75
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,690
So we talk about that.
You can get people to be emotional even

76
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:48,690
about something as pedestrian as a
trashcan.

77
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,190
We probably have the world's,
I think we have the world's best

78
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,410
selection of trash cans and even a trash
can can make you smile if you have this

79
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:59,380
man in the desert interaction between
customer and salesperson.

80
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,640
She's got a lacquer trash cans so much
as it fits in that corner perfectly.

81
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:06,340
You love the way the pedal opens and
closes,

82
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,760
closes you're,
you're actually kind of proud of your

83
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:10,600
trash can.
You're,

84
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,890
you've considered showing it off to
house gifts that you have over it stuff

85
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:16,210
and proudly saying,
no,

86
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,800
that's my trash can.
When you think about,

87
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,790
you know,
my trashcan,

88
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,850
and that's man in the desert selling.
You're just trying to help her figure

89
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:27,010
out what she needs to feel that way.
And uh,

90
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,180
people want emotion.
