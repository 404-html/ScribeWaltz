1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,240
Feeling which are socially isolated,
it's related to being physically

2
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,300
isolated from other people,
but it's not the same thing.

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,720
One can be lonely in a marriage,
lonely in a family,

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,710
they can be lonely in a crowd.
So we found it isn't the number of

5
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:21,830
contacts or the frequency of interaction
with other people.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,540
It's the quality of those interactions.
Freshmen who have gone to college find

7
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,430
themselves among many,
many other people,

8
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:31,380
lots of social activities.
They go to mixers and they look out.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,180
Everyone else is talking with other
people and they're sitting there all

10
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:38,780
alone in their head and so that actually
can make their feeling of isolation

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,780
greater for that moment.
So being around other people,

12
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:44,550
that's not what makes people less
lonely.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,500
It's feeling connected.

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,800
Tell other people that makes them feel
less lonely.

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,990
Traditionally,
loneliness and depression,

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,370
loneliness and anxiety with treated as
very similar constructs.

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,710
So much so that one of the common
measures of depression that used in

18
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:06,410
epidemiology has.
As one of the questions,

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,300
do you feel lonely?
Uh,

20
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,770
our own researcher,
Mr Trump,

21
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:12,770
others have looked at whether loneliness
and depression to the same thing.

22
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:16,010
And we find them to be separate
contracts,

23
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:20,060
they're separate.
Mental states are longitudinal research

24
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:25,040
and our experimental research has shown
that loneliness leads to increased

25
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:29,180
depressive symptomatology.
So if no matter how depressed you are

26
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:31,340
today,
if you're feeling lonely today,

27
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,520
you will be more depressed a year from
now,

28
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,090
above and beyond what your level of
depression today would predict because

29
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:41,180
of the loneliness.
We also find that depression leads you

30
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:43,280
to withdrawal,
so at difference in depression and

31
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:45,440
loneliness,
loneliness makes you want to reach out

32
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:48,560
and contact other people,
be a part of that group,

33
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,150
be a part of that relationship.

34
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,360
Depression is associated with depressed
an effect,

35
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:56,390
but also with lethargy,
kind of this withdrawal from others,

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,710
and indeed with depression,
we find over time people do withdraw

37
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:04,610
from others and that withdrawal and the
increased stress associated with that

38
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,570
leads them to field lonelier.
So you have this pernicious feedback

39
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:10,280
loop below maynard.
They are,

40
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,190
the more depressed they become,
the more depressed they are,

41
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:15,740
the more they withdraw and the lonelier
they become.

42
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,180
If you look at those two effects of the
effect of loneliness and depression is

43
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,700
stronger than the effect of depression
on loaning us.

44
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,820
People can be depressed for other
reasons and feeling lonely,

45
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,410
but many people who go in to seek
treatment for depression at the root of

46
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:34,370
the problem is their feeling of
disconnection and isolation and unless

47
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:37,850
that's treated,
the depression or any attempt to fix

48
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:40,490
that is really just kind of a transient
bandaid.

49
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:41,810
It's not getting at the root problem.

50
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,600
The measurements of loneliness is

51
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,970
somewhat not obvious.
Bob People know that they feel isolated,

52
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:56,000
they feel disconnected.
They don't have others on whom they can

53
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:58,790
rely or talk,
but it's mostly they don't have a

54
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,690
confidant.
They don't have anyone who affirms who

55
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:03,640
they are.
That's part of it.

56
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,810
Now,
if you ask people,

57
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:08,680
do they feel lonely?
There tends to be this stigma associated

58
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:11,320
with loneliness.
I think our research has suggested it's

59
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:14,230
an inappropriate stigma,
but there's nevertheless the stigma

60
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:16,650
associated with the loneliness,
so people underreport.

61
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,280
If you ask them,
do you feel lonely?

62
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,370
They under report,
but if you ask them,

63
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:23,170
are there others,
son whom they can rely to,

64
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:26,710
whom they can relate to and whom they
can confide a.

65
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:31,030
that's when you start to see people
admitting this feeling of isolation.

66
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,710
There's also this sense in which they
don't have a collective identity,

67
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,070
so immediately after nine slash 11 when
we all survived that tragedy,

68
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,070
it made being an American salient.

69
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,540
That's a social identity,
but if you notice in this country,

70
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,490
journalists were writing about the
harmony,

71
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:54,010
the goodwill that existed in America.
That was a step up of what had been felt

72
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,650
weak before nine slash 11.
That's part of being connected and so

73
00:03:57,651 --> 00:04:00,250
that alone,
the individual is also absent that

74
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:03,490
social identity,
and it may be in the form of feeling

75
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:07,930
like you're an American after a tragedy
or it might be a Chicago cubs are New

76
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,030
York Yankees Fan.
These kinds of identities are part of

77
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:14,260
how we are connected to other other
individuals and other groups and loamy

78
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:15,910
individuals tend to lock those as well.

79
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,820
There are several secrets to overcoming
or avoiding moments I.

80
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,130
I like to use the analog of of hunger.
A loneliness has evolved because it has

81
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,810
very adaptive purpose.
We are fundamentally social species,

82
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,250
but we need some signal when that
important need isn't being met.

83
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,120
Very much like hunger.
We need a reasonable level of blood

84
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:45,940
sugar or else we don't have the
metabolic resources,

85
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:49,870
the energy to pursue foraging and other
activities.

86
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,320
Uh,
when we start to have lower blood sugar

87
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:54,370
levels,
we become hungry,

88
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,520
uh,
and that's a signal that we should find

89
00:04:57,521 --> 00:05:02,521
food and eat and refuel.
If we ignore that hunger signal.

90
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,400
If we think that somehow that
stigmatizing,

91
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,540
and so we simply persisted not pursuing
any food.

92
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:14,950
And ignoring that signal,
we can become so depleted of energy that

93
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:19,600
we're no longer able to seek that food
so it can become chronic and deadly.

94
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,880
Loneliness is very much like that man.
Instead of sustaining us with calories,

95
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,600
it seemed sustains us with connections
in evolutionary times.

96
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,820
We were not able to fend off large wild
beasts very well as individuals with the

97
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:36,640
stick.
Nor are we able to take care of our

98
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:41,290
offspring who had the longest period of
abject dependency of any species.

99
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,470
If we were simply solitary animals,
we are able to achieve a reproduction

100
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,230
survival and our offspring survive long
enough so that they to reproduce a

101
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:56,020
because we acted as a group as a
collective.

102
00:05:56,021 --> 00:06:00,890
So find yourself ostracized or separated
from that group is a threatening

103
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,130
dangerous circumstance.
Recognizing that you also can understand

104
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:08,960
how the feeling of loneliness,
the pain of loneliness,

105
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:12,740
the threat that's associated with
loneliness is a signal very much like

106
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:15,140
hunger,
but it's there to cue the need to

107
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,980
reconnect,
to protect that part of our,

108
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,800
our existence.
Uh,

109
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,730
and if we respond to it,
is that cute?

110
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,410
Then it can be very healthy.
If you don't respond to that queue,

111
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,320
then you can fall into the grips of
chronic loneliness.

112
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:32,270
And that has been,
as I suggested,

113
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:35,480
very deleterious mental psychological
effects,

114
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:37,190
but also physiological effects.
