1
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:11,310
How do we thrive in a world where every
which way we turn our fear is being

2
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:16,780
activated by politicians,
by the media,

3
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,310
and by the desperate events that are
happening around us.

4
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:27,510
What is really fascinating when we look
at the brain research around fear is

5
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:33,061
that our brains proxy anything that
feels unfamiliar,

6
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,080
incoherent or inaccessible as being
unsafe.

7
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,370
So let me give you an example.
There is fascinating research that shows

8
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,690
that when people have lower levels of
self esteem and they are in a job in

9
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:56,800
which they are recognized and promoted,

10
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,630
that promotion can feel incoherent to
the person with low self esteem.

11
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:10,870
They have low self esteem and they might
be used to and expecting to be treated

12
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:15,890
badly.
So what is fascinating is the results

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,180
showing that when people are promoted,
when they have lower levels of self

14
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:23,780
esteem,
they are more likely to leave their

15
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:28,430
jobs.
Fear is an incredibly,

16
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,490
incredibly powerful force in our lives
and our brains have fairly immature in

17
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,340
assessing anything that feels slightly
incoherent or unfamiliar as unsafe.

18
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,630
What this might mean is that if you are
used to hearing a story time and time

19
00:01:53,661 --> 00:01:58,661
again from a parent or from a partner
about how you are not good enough,

20
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,700
you are more likely to be drawn to that
relationship because it feels familiar.

21
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,790
The messaging that you are getting time
and time again is connected with what

22
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:18,791
you expect to get when we have
politicians who are effectively

23
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:24,050
demagogues,
who are inspiring fear in us,

24
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,860
that fear leads to very particular and
relatively predictable responses.

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,020
When we are fearful,
there is this idea in psychological

26
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:41,021
research of mortality salience that when
our mortality is threatened,

27
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:43,970
when someone says,
Oh,

28
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:48,971
this group of people is out to get you
and we feel that we are actively being

29
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:54,971
threatened,
we are more likely to stereotype.

30
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,850
We are more likely as individuals to
become bigoted.

31
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,410
We are more likely to respond to
messages that we hear time and time

32
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:10,771
again,
even if they are against our values as

33
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,080
somehow making sense to us.
How do we protect ourselves against

34
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:20,350
this?
Daniel Conaman describes system one

35
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:25,351
thinking and system two thinking system.
One thinking is the intuitive response,

36
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,170
the emotional,
visceral us and them that can sometimes

37
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:37,171
arise out of fear system.
Two is the deliberate thoughtful

38
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,300
examination of what is this person
saying?

39
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,810
Is it aligned with how I really want to
be?

40
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,040
Is it connected with how I really wanted
to raise my children?

41
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,760
Is this a world that I wanted to
support?

42
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,980
When we are able to step back from our
fear,

43
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,520
not to pretend that it doesn't exist,
but to see our fear for what it is fear

44
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,680
not a direction,
but data and an emotion.

45
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,040
When we are able to step back from the
fear and able to assess the fear and

46
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:27,091
assist the messaging from the place of
our values in a more deliberate,

47
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,170
thoughtful way,
we are able to come to a place where we

48
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:36,640
are ultimately protect it from the
demagoguery message,

49
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,030
from the message of fear and are able to
move ourselves forward in a way that is

50
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:47,281
aligned with how we truly want to be and
with a world that we truly want to live

51
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:52,351
in.
When Donald Trump first started with all

52
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:56,260
of this messaging,
we used to hear things that the

53
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:58,090
politicians would say and we would be
like,

54
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,660
oh my goodness,
how can the person possibly say that

55
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:02,494
thing?

56
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,100
But what happens over time is the more
familiar something sounds so the more

57
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,830
we've heard it,
time and time again,

58
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,050
even if the story is inaccurate,
even if the story doesn't serve us,

59
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,180
the more we're likely to become inured
to it and immune to it.

60
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,840
So what I actually think from a media
perspective is when I speak to people in

61
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:30,280
the media about this,
they will often say,

62
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:33,070
well,
we simply go with the story takes us.

63
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,280
So we'll give as much coverage to
wherever the stories at even if the

64
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:42,820
story is one that incites hatred or
violence.

65
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,000
But I actually think that there is a
very,

66
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:50,140
very powerful ethical choice that the
media makes a net.

67
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,770
Because when they expose and expose and
expose and expose a story that is about

68
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:04,001
hatred and a story that is about
violence as human beings,

69
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,950
the more familiar we become with that
story,

70
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,380
the more insured we become to it.

71
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,800
And I think we can see exactly this in
the current elections,

72
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,280
that things that were said six months
ago where everyone was horrified that a

73
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:26,021
politician could possibly even prevail
on people to listen to what was being

74
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,440
said or not being met with,
oh,

75
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,630
there we go again.
We somehow have become inured to the

76
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:40,631
messaging because of the familiarity
with which we are hearing it and I think

77
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:46,901
it's really important for us as a
society and for us as voters to

78
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,470
recognize that a familiar story is not
necessarily a truthful story.

79
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,920
A familiar story might sound comfortable
and our brains might proxy that story

80
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:05,360
for meaning safe and therefore right and
therefore comfortable.

81
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,060
But that story doesn't necessarily
reflect us or what we value.

82
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,780
And it's really important to be able to
step out from the safety of what might

83
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:23,321
at this point feel familiar and really
recognize the words for what they are.

84
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,520
They are words that are inciting hatred
and division and stereotyping in us as a

85
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:36,740
society.
And for many of us,

86
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:39,500
that's not the society in which we want
to live.

87
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,220
And I think there's a moral impetus on
us to be able to step back from the

88
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:50,150
story and step forward with our values.
