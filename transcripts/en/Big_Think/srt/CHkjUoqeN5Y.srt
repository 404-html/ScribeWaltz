1
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,250
I finished a book in the early part of
2007 for publication in October,

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,090
2007 on current and national affairs,
um,

3
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:23,110
because I think that the most important
overarching thing going on is that the

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,760
United States has to again become the
land of opportunity and the land and the

5
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:31,190
place that operates according to
principles.

6
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,460
So it's called America the principled
six opportunities for becoming a can do

7
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:40,790
nation once again.
And so those six opportunities seem to

8
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:45,470
me to be the most important issues.
One is how do we secure our future?

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,910
And security isn't simply a matter of
watchdogs at airports.

10
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:54,800
It's a matter of economic security.
That's how we keep jobs in the United

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,160
States for Americans.
That's how we ensure that we have the

12
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:02,630
technology to make us safe.
And that requires investments in

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,720
innovation and it requires open minds.
So the life sciences are so important.

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,540
And yet,
um,

15
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,820
they have been so discredited by an
administration that has not cared about

16
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:16,790
science.

17
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,790
We're not doing enough to educate people
in the US in science and math,

18
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,200
which are so important to our future.
Most of the engineering and science

19
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:29,810
degrees being given in the United States
today,

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,280
advanced degrees,
phds are going to foreign nationals or

21
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:37,280
people of foreign origins and as far as
I'm concerned,

22
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:40,550
they're welcome here,
but I would also like to see our young

23
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:42,980
people get those degrees.
So that's,

24
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:44,360
uh,
that's the first challenge.

25
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,060
I'm very concerned about the
disappearing middle class and the

26
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,560
problems of balancing work and family
that women have.

27
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,980
So pursuing happiness was something
that's written into our earliest

28
00:01:57,891 --> 00:01:58,790
origins,
life,

29
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:02,930
liberty and the pursuit of happiness and
awful lot of people aren't happy because

30
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:06,530
they don't have healthcare because they
have to take two jobs.

31
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:08,570
They don't,
they're worried about their children.

32
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,040
So that's an important issue.
Clearly the war in Iraq as an important

33
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,610
issue currently,
but it's part of a larger problem of how

34
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:18,170
do we engage with the world.

35
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,770
Is our form of engagement only saber
rattling or are we making those

36
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:29,240
grassroots investments in the economic
development of other countries and the

37
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:33,830
development of their leaders so that we
have more allies and friends around the

38
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:36,170
world.
That's a major challenge.

39
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,350
We are not liked in many parts of the
world.

40
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:44,351
Well actually there's a gap between
liking Americans as a people and liking

41
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:49,580
the American government.
Many more people like Americans than

42
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:53,900
like the American government.
We have an speaking of government.

43
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,900
We have a problem with respect for
government.

44
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,700
In fact,
in recent years people have discredited

45
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:04,600
government because so many government
officials have done things that are

46
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,230
ethically challenged to put it in a
positive way,

47
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,920
but a lot of Washington was under
indictment for awhile.

48
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,860
So if we don't restore respect for
government,

49
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,950
I'm sick of politicians running against
government.

50
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,730
I'm running for this office because I
believe that we shouldn't have these

51
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:22,564
offices.

52
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,050
It's ridiculous.
So we need respect.

53
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:28,990
So the good people run for office in
turn,

54
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:33,991
they appoint competent people and they
care about how well government is run.

55
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,390
It's an.
It's a traditional American principle to

56
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:40,930
say that government is best,
which governs least,

57
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,380
but frankly it can't govern least unless
it governs better because it's much more

58
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:51,490
costly to have a disaster like Hurricane
Katrina than it would have been to

59
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:55,390
invest in the levees in New Orleans in
the first place.

60
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,800
And finally,
I think we need a spirit of service.

61
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:04,450
The partisan divides in the partisan
ugliness and America has plagued us if

62
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:09,451
we spend so much time arguing with each
other while fighting wars that we can't

63
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:12,820
possibly win and probably shouldn't have
been in in the first place,

64
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,620
then we will never heal this nation.
We need things that bring us together

65
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,220
across partisan divides as well as
divides of race or age or or urban

66
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:27,580
versus rural,
and I think community service and the

67
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:32,020
generosity of American philanthropy or
things that can unite us.

68
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,930
Again.
So those are the themes that I've been

69
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:37,930
writing about.
Those are the things that I want on the

70
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:41,410
agenda for the presidential election in
2008.

71
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,450
Those are the things in the news that
bother me the most,

72
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:49,390
but also inspire me to think about
solutions.
