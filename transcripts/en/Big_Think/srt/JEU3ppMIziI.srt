1
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,100
Nobody doesn't love you.
Let me back up.

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,740
When we think of places you might find
life,

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,640
we typically think of the goldilocks
zone around a star where water would be

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,190
liquid in its natural state.
And if you get a little too close to the

5
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,460
star,
heat would evaporate the water and you

6
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:30,170
don't have it anymore.
It's gone.

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,830
Too far away would freeze.
And neither of those states of h two o

8
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,620
or are useful to life as we know it.
We need liquid water.

9
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:42,590
So you can establish this green zone,
this habitable zone,

10
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:46,520
this goldilocks zone,
where if you find a planet orbiting

11
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:47,480
there,
hey,

12
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,490
it's a good chance it could have liquid
water.

13
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,550
Let's look there first for life as we
know it.

14
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,140
Now it turns out that the source of heat
of course,

15
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:00,650
is traceable to the sun.
And if you go farther out,

16
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,020
everything would or should be frozen.

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,850
All other things being equal.
But you're Ropa a moon of Jupiter

18
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:11,960
sitting well outside of the goldilocks
zone is kept warm,

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,650
not from energy sources traceable to the
sun,

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,600
but from what we call the tidal forces
of Jupiter itself.

21
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:25,601
So Jupiter and surrounding moons are
actually pumping energy into Europa.

22
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,370
And how did you do that?
As you rope it orbits Jupiter,

23
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,960
it's shape changes.
It's not fundamentally different from

24
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:40,961
tides rising and falling on earth.
The shape of the water system of the

25
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:46,820
earth is responding to tidal forces of
the mood.

26
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:52,010
And when you do that to a solid object,
the solid object is,

27
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,940
is stressing.
And because of this,

28
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:01,730
a consequence of this is that you're
pumping energy into the object.

29
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,540
It is no different from when you say
anyone who's familiar with racket

30
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,190
sports,
indoor racket,

31
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:09,950
sports,
you could be a racket ball or squash.

32
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,350
You say,
let's warm up the ball before we start

33
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:15,110
playing.
You want to hit it around a few times.

34
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,880
You are literally warming up the ball.
It's not just simply let's get loose.

35
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,080
You are literally warming up the ball.
How you are distorting it every time you

36
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:28,370
smack it and then the resilience of the
ball pops it back into shape.

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,500
And every time you do that,
every smack your pumping energy into the

38
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:38,501
ball is not fundamentally different from
what's going on in orbit around Jupiter.

39
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,650
So you have this frozen world Europa
completely frozen on its surface,

40
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,160
but you look at,
you look at the surface and there cracks

41
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:50,850
in the ice,
there,

42
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,640
ridges in the ice where there's a crack
and it's shifted.

43
00:02:55,641 --> 00:03:00,490
And then refroze.
So this Ridge has discontinuity in the

44
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:02,980
crack and then continues in another
place.

45
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,120
So what this tells you is that Europa
cannot be completely frozen because if

46
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,550
it were,
nothing would be moving.

47
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,150
You look at the surface of Europa,
the frozen surface,

48
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,330
they're like ice chunks that are like
shifted and refrozen and shifted again.

49
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:25,540
It looks just like if you fly over,
uh,

50
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,560
the,
the,

51
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,640
the Arctic ocean fly over the Arctic
Ocean in the winter.

52
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,640
These are ice sheets that are breaking
and refreezing all the time.

53
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,420
It's the same signature as that.
So all of us are convinced that beneath

54
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:43,900
this icy surface is an ocean of liquid
water.

55
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,340
And there's no reason to think it
wouldn't have been liquid for billions

56
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,880
of years on earth where we find liquid
water,

57
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,380
we find life.

58
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,200
Yeah.

59
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Wherever we find liquid water,
we find life even places like the Dead

60
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,470
Sea.
Why did anybody call it a Dead Sea?

61
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,470
Because the microscope hadn't yet been
invented.

62
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,760
And sure of the,
maybe there's no macroscopic vertebrate

63
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:16,110
fishes,
but microbes

64
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:22,730
have no problems thriving in practically
any conditions under which you would

65
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:27,290
find liquid water.
So what this means is not only do we

66
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,630
have a source of heat outside of the
goldilocks zone,

67
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,780
we have conditions under which life
could be thriving.

68
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,280
And knowing that this is possible has
completely broaden the net that we are

69
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:43,130
casting in search for life in the
universe.

70
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,240
No longer is it that,
let me,

71
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,280
let's find a 72 degree title pond and
see life forming there.

72
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:56,891
No life is pretty hardy and yeah,
if it takes liquid water,

73
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:00,620
we,
that may be the other place in the solar

74
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:05,240
system that is teaming with some form or
another of life.

75
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,750
So yeah,
we all want to go to your roper period.

76
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,080
Can we got to go ice fishing though?
Cause you've got to cut a hole or melt a

77
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:15,380
hole.
You got to get there somehow because

78
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:20,381
this sheet of ice by some estimates are
several kilometers thick.

79
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,540
And so it'll take some effort to get
through that,

80
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,940
which we haven't really fully figured
out yet.

81
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,520
But it's an engineering problem,
not a science problem.

82
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,180
So clever engineers should be able to
figure that one out.

83
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,140
And by the way,
you rope is not the only one of these

84
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:40,940
moons in the outer solar system that's
kept warm by the sort of title stress

85
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,850
forces.
There are other moons that feel the same

86
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,790
influx of energy.
So for example,

87
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,630
io,
that's the innermost moon of Jupiter

88
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,780
that suffers from this phenomenon even
more at that moon is so hot.

89
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,530
There are volcanoes erupting from
within.

90
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,790
There it is,
it is rendered Multan whatever solid

91
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,820
parts of that moon there are.
And so in fact,

92
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,850
the most volcanically active place in
the solar system is io,

93
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,320
one of the moons of Jupiter.
And we don't know how to sustain life

94
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,710
under temperatures that hot.
So,

95
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,790
but it's a reminder that if you're
looking for sources of energy,

96
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:34,510
we no longer need to be anchored to a
host star in our search for life in the

97
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,604
universe.

98
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,540
Mm.
