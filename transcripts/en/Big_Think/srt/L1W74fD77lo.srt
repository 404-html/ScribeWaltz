1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,520
Best messages in any given negotiation
are really implied,

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,680
indirectly come to the other person
based on thinking that you're getting

3
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:18,080
them to do,
getting them to get some really solid

4
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:23,081
thought behind their answers and so a
great thing to send someone an email is

5
00:00:24,171 --> 00:00:29,030
have you given up on this project
because nobody likes to give up on

6
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:34,031
anything and at the same time,
nobody wants to say yes to that because

7
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:38,300
they don't know what they're letting
themselves in for when they say yes.

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,690
You know what?
It's interesting because that particular

9
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:46,691
email has restarted negotiations that
I've seen dead silence for weeks prior

10
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:53,111
to that and simply sending that email
all by itself and in many cases you can

11
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:57,590
get a response within three to five
minutes of reading the email or the

12
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:00,620
text.
That's a great way to get things

13
00:01:00,621 --> 00:01:01,970
restarted.
Now,

14
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:06,170
the problem with that is there's a
really good chance you contributed to

15
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:11,171
the silence in the first place
and your next move when they respond is

16
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:16,610
you've got to get a that's right out of
them next because they have to feel like

17
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,040
that their communication is being paid
attention to.

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,340
Summary is designed to let the other
side know that you really understand

19
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:28,670
what's going on now,
and if nothing else,

20
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,110
at least you understand their position.
There are a lot of negotiators that

21
00:01:33,111 --> 00:01:38,111
really will give in on a deal because
being understood is more important than

22
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:43,260
getting what they want in particular.
Um,

23
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,030
the assertive negotiator being
understood is actually more important to

24
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:48,710
them than,
than actually making the deal.

25
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,820
So everybody wants to be understood
anyway.

26
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:57,630
Let people know you completely
understand where they're coming from and

27
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:01,530
that's the design of a summary,
summarizing the facts and how they feel

28
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:06,531
about the facts and actually if you can
summarize their feelings about the facts

29
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:10,200
that are driving them,
but that they're blind to will make a

30
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:13,230
big difference to them because then they
feel really understood that empathy

31
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:17,370
connection is there and they may
actually change their mind about what

32
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,580
decisions they've made.
One empathy has been established.
