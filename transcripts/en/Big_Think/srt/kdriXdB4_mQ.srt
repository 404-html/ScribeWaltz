1
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,430
Well,
I've been interested in writing online

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,760
for some time.
I was

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,840
an early participant in salons table
talk,

4
00:00:14,841 --> 00:00:19,841
which was their forum,
the section in 96 97 um,

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,850
because I just thought it was
interesting that the readers could be

6
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:28,700
published in the same space as the
writers.

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,790
That idea was intoxicating to me.
And then I spent some time at Howard

8
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,970
Rheingold site mindstorms cause I wanted
to check out a different environment for

9
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:43,250
writing online.
But I didn't know anything about

10
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:48,140
blogging because both those sites were
produced by people who kind of new code.

11
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,810
I didn't really know about blogging
until a student in one of my classes in

12
00:00:55,251 --> 00:01:00,251
2002 told me about it and he said,
professor rose and this is really up

13
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:03,740
your alley.
And he described his blog,

14
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:08,741
which wasn't opinion block.
He was a conservative undergraduate at

15
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:11,330
Nyu,
obviously I minority,

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,950
but he found in his opinion blog away to
make connections and the and have a

17
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:16,490
voice.

18
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,650
Right.
And he started telling me sort of how

19
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:20,870
the blogging system worked.
And I remember he said,

20
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:24,050
if you get a link from a big blog,
you can get lots of readers.

21
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,281
So I said,
well,

22
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:29,630
how many?
You said five 10,000 and I found this

23
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:34,631
staggering because the leading quarterly
journals in my scholarly field,

24
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:40,061
if that wasn't the kind of writer I was,
wanted to be our like three thousand

25
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,383
four thousand readers.
Right?

26
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,380
And He's already telling me that his
opinion blog can get five or 10

27
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,430
overnight.
So I didn't really understand what a

28
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:50,960
blog was,
but it's very interesting what he was

29
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:55,730
telling me.
So he told me to go check out his blog

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,760
and insta pundit.com
so I was very intrigued by what he had

31
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:03,440
told me.
And I started walking back to my office.

32
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:07,670
By the time I got close to my office,
that was closer to a running because I

33
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:11,870
just had this sense that I wanted to
know what it was.

34
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,070
And I remember logging in and looking at
instant money and I didn't understand

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,640
what it was because I was looking at the
surface of the blog without

36
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:25,430
understanding the blog is fear behind
it.

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,600
But once I did everything that I had
been kind of wrestling with since table

38
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:36,731
talk and mindstorms,
I realized it's here.

39
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,300
This is the thing,
self publishing is here.

40
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,070
That's a long revolution.
Self publishing,

41
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,550
that's a 300 year event,
right?

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,390
It's to the point where the capital
required to be a publisher has gone down

43
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,630
almost to zero.
That's a 300 year event,

44
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,010
you know,
like a 500 year flood,

45
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,260
so media time,
that's like a thousand year flood.

46
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,970
So I took a year to study blogging from
2002 to 2003 and the reasons I wanted to

47
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:14,530
do it,
we're about five.

48
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,710
The main one was I wanted to have my own
magazine with no editor to tell me what

49
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,280
a valid idea about the press and media
was.

50
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,490
I wanted to completely evade the
existing editorial system because

51
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,040
frankly it had kept me in a very limited
state of expression for a long time.

52
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,400
There's only so much that I could say if
I wanted to publish a Columbia

53
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:41,710
journalism review article,
if I wanted to write in a hot bed for

54
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:43,270
the Los Angeles Times,
which I did.

55
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,900
And it was just the frustration with the
limited range of,

56
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,770
of terms and the,
the very stunted imaginary of the press

57
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:57,220
about itself was the main reason I
wanted to have a blog,

58
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:59,440
which I conceived of as my own one
person magazine,

59
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:01,780
which is still my description of what
press thing is.

60
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,210
So I wanted to go around the gatekeepers
and I wanted to know what was happening

61
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:10,120
in this field because I was pretty sure
as soon as I understood the self

62
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:12,310
publishing is here,
that it was going to have major

63
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:14,650
consequences for professional
journalism.

64
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,400
So I wanted to know it.
I also wanted to catch up to,

65
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,290
as it were,
where my students were,

66
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,230
right.
And this student was a little bit ahead

67
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:24,640
of,
of the crowd,

68
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,360
but he was definitely pointing me
towards something that would connect me

69
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:31,390
to my students.
And um,

70
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,630
and I wanted
a platform to address both professional

71
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,930
journalist.
So I've been talking to for a while and

72
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:45,931
my earlier work and this new class of
potential journalist that I saw a rising

73
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:50,490
up also,
um,

74
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,640
I have a phd.
I did my dissertation on the whole idea

75
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:59,641
of the public as this thing on the
receiving and of the press.

76
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,880
That was what my research was about.
So when I say this is a 300 year of men,

77
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,840
it comes out of that because what
blogging means is that the self

78
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,820
publishing public is real.
You know,

79
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,580
a lead and said,
freedom of the press belongs to those

80
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:23,290
who own one.
Well,

81
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:27,280
what I said was blogging means anyone
can own one.

82
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,500
That was exciting.
That was something I had to be in on.

83
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,400
And I knew by the end of that afternoon,
I would have to have a blog.
