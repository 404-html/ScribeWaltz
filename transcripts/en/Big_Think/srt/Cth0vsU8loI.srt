1
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,220
Software unification.
Uh,

2
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,590
so that I no longer care what computing
device I pick up,

3
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:25,900
whether it's a laptop or a desktop,
whether it's one I own are one in a

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,240
public place.
Uh,

5
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:30,610
whether it has a small screen or a large
screen.

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,050
Uh,
I sit down,

7
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:35,080
identify myself,
I tune in my information world.

8
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,380
Uh,
I get it in the same way on a no screen

9
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:40,980
computer in a car.
Um,

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,240
uniform access across all platforms,
computers,

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,250
telephones to my entire information
life.

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,120
It's easy to achieve in hardware.
They're hard software issues,

13
00:00:57,431 --> 00:00:59,500
but they should have been solved 15
years ago.

14
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,900
So long from the other side of the fence
is,

15
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,910
um,
if I were to invest in a,

16
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,390
in a new company,
I would invest in some of the companies

17
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:15,870
that are working on so called digital
furnaces.

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,320
Uh,
in five years everybody throws out all

19
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:23,520
his cds and dvds.
There are larger MP3 players.

20
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:28,910
A home stereo system is and t v V
systems are integrated and this is a

21
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,210
billion multibillion dollar transition.
As things stand,

22
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:36,720
it will be Sony and Google,
a Toshiba,

23
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,310
a few with very large companies doing
it.

24
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:40,170
And they won't,
they won't do it badly,

25
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:41,310
but they won't do it.
Well.

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,990
Uh,
I would invest in,

27
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:47,991
in one of the small companies that has
imaginative instead of recycled ideas as

28
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:49,830
to how to make that transition.

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,111
Uh,
I,

30
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:54,581
you know,
I,

31
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,210
I,
the one of the spaces I'm really

32
00:01:56,211 --> 00:02:00,320
watching very carefully is the mobile
space.

33
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:05,370
And I think that for a long time,
innovation on the mobile platform was

34
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,230
held back by the carriers and their
control over everything and they're sort

35
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:14,810
of passion to control everything.
Um,

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,840
now that we're getting some brands of
phones that are consumer brands that are

37
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:25,451
popular enough that we're starting to
get the correct kind of a separation of,

38
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,960
uh,
you know,

39
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,270
people say,
I want an iphone or I want to,

40
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:31,790
I Google phone an android phone,
right?

41
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,280
People start to say those kinds of
things.

42
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,020
Um,
and those are the,

43
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,590
those are the brands they want.
And the carrier is just whoever you give

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,110
service from.
And if we can break that,

45
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,720
that,
that control that the carriers have had

46
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:47,390
over the platform,
then we get the same kind of innovation

47
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:48,350
that we had,
um,

48
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,280
on computers and the Internet.
People can be building apps and doing

49
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:54,920
all kinds of crazy things.
And I don't know what's gonna come out

50
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:55,790
of that.
Uh,

51
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:59,150
I just know that when you,
when you put together a platform,

52
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,650
people can innovate on interesting
things end up happening.

53
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,880
Uh,
boy,

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,100
uh,
I've,

55
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,450
uh,
I don't know.

56
00:03:11,451 --> 00:03:13,640
I mean,
I'm obviously looking forward to what's

57
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:18,260
going to happen in media and the way
that people consume a content.

58
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,230
That's what I'm most interested in.
So,

59
00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:24,050
um,
clearly the whole idea of mobile in the

60
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:26,060
idea that you are carrying around with
you,

61
00:03:26,061 --> 00:03:30,320
a screen that can go with you and know
where you are and know who your friends

62
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:31,220
are,
uh,

63
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:36,221
utilizing that kind of a technology to
immerse yourself into the world of a

64
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,440
narrative is something that I'm most
interested in.

65
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:42,200
How to create narrative that,
um,

66
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,230
that helps people understand what their
places in the world and how to make the

67
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:50,510
world a better place.
So those kinds of technologies are most

68
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:55,511
interesting to me.
You know,

69
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:57,570
again,
right now I'm interested,

70
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,560
I'm interested in as a storyteller in
uh,

71
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,050
in trying to use narrative to,
to promote good in the world.

72
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:06,630
So I'm interested in companies that are,
uh,

73
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,890
that are philanthropic by nature and are
trying to um,

74
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,270
uh,
to promote,

75
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:13,560
uh,
the greater good.

76
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:14,550
So,
um,

77
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,970
technology that's designed to make the
world a better place.

78
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,500
Uh,
it's,

79
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,060
it's the most interesting to me.

80
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,700
I think what I've heard is a lot more
disruption going on and that's exciting

81
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:31,020
because it means there are new
opportunities.

82
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,380
It's frightening too,
but I find optimism and excitement in

83
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:39,381
disruption
kind of on a,

84
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,850
but I think that the answer might be
that the streamed web is important.

85
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,250
We thought the web was about content
like ours sites and pages,

86
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,970
but I think now we see with twitter and
rss and email all adding up,

87
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,840
it says new streamed live web and it's
going to be hard to get used to that

88
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:58,210
next never ending web of content.

89
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,520
Well,
I think we're going to have great new

90
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,060
ways to interface with information.
And you know,

91
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:11,300
that's on normal desktop and laptop
computers,

92
00:05:11,301 --> 00:05:14,450
but also mobile devices.
And I think we'll see much more

93
00:05:14,451 --> 00:05:17,210
interactivity in the way we interface
with things.

94
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,090
And we'll see much more richness in the
communication between the computer and

95
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,670
humans.
Oh Gosh.

96
00:05:26,671 --> 00:05:29,400
I don't have a specific company.
I know some directions I would,

97
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,220
I would bet on,
I bet on,

98
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,280
uh,
interactivity moving forward a great

99
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:38,490
deal.
I bet on applications replacing or

100
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,990
supplementing documents for describing
things for content.

101
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,980
So I think we'll see media outlets
produce very active content in the

102
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:49,410
future that,
that readers can kind of interact with.

103
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,620
So those are some,
some of the directions that I think will

104
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:53,250
be exciting.
