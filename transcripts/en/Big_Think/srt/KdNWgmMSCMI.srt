1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,370
I was waiting for a banker to drop off
some cash to me,

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,440
I only,
the only way I could you can function in

3
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:16,380
Afghanistan is you have to have cash
because there is no banking system,

4
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:18,060
there is no credit card,
there is no check.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,750
So I had a big coat like lots of pockets
in that code and every day between 100,

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,600
$200,000 stuff in my pockets and just
pay people cash as they were.

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,990
Corruption is beyond words.
It's the second most corrupt country in

8
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:37,880
the world.
And um,

9
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,390
I think it's well on its way to be
number one after Somalia.

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,280
But um,
so when you see people,

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,370
um,
uh,

12
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,580
there is no laws,
rules or regulation,

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,140
there is.
You can go and say,

14
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:56,720
well,
I just gave you 50,000.

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,620
He could come back and say,
no you didn't.

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,850
You don't know what to do about that,
that it's not like United States while

17
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:04,020
I'm going to call my lawyer.

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,500
You just gone.
That money is gone.

19
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,500
So you just have to feel people and you
have to trust.

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,100
So I needed to make weekly payments to
the staff.

21
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:21,651
And the workers and a crew and he um,
told me that they cannot leave the set

22
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:31,401
because I was shooting as if you could
please bring me $50,000 by 6:00 PM at

23
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:34,170
this location.
And he said,

24
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:35,520
okay,
I'm coming with a black car.

25
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,800
And uh,
I'd never met him before he came.

26
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,220
I saw a black car parked in front.
I saw him and he says,

27
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,990
get in the car.
I got in the car,

28
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,360
we'd go out on the corner and I'll pay
you the money because I had to give

29
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:56,361
70,000.
I had 20,000 and I needed 50,000 and uh,

30
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:01,730
seven and keep going and going and
I am getting almost out of the city

31
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:04,740
completely.
And they said,

32
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:07,120
where are we going?
And he said,

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,840
well,
how much do you have?

34
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,340
How much do I have?
I said,

35
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:17,100
where does my money?
How much do you have?

36
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,920
Any what,
whether you talking about.

37
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,460
I said,
aren't you with the bank?

38
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,890
And then she'd bring me money,
black car coming in,

39
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:27,930
bringing me the money.
He just laughed.

40
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:32,931
I really like this abnoxious
laughed at.

41
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,660
Just chills,
you know,

42
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,030
in the bone.
And I looked at him,

43
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,440
I said,
what do you want?

44
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,660
And he said,
well,

45
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,500
I could hold you and get some money or I
could kill you and get some money,

46
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,310
or if you have some money you could give
it to me.

47
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:54,840
Now,
depending on how much you have.

48
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,770
I said I have $20,000.
It wasn't my pocket.

49
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:01,090
I handed to him.
I showed it to him.

50
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,100
And uh,
I said,

51
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,240
you,
if you take me,

52
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,890
nobody's going to give you money because
I've already written leather's not to

53
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,560
release me from the Taliban if I got
caught.

54
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,320
Um,
so that's useless.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,650
Um,
but you can have this like you have to

56
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:22,651
take me back right now
and excuse me.

57
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:25,750
That's how I negotiate my deal with
them.

58
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,230
Um,
the next thing that happened was,

59
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,060
um,
I think it was for four days after that,

60
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,270
uh,
this guy who was writing me at security

61
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:38,410
company,
it was,

62
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,570
we changed security companies,
quite dolphin also because you know,

63
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,700
you don't know who is involved with the
security company,

64
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,220
you know,
one of these bodyguards which we had

65
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:51,550
between 80 and 70 a day.
One of them could be,

66
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,340
um,
you know,

67
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,850
the one that has ready to kill you.
So I was sitting in my car and I'm with

68
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:06,550
one of these bodyguards that's about
3:30 in the morning.

69
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,340
We're going on a set,
5:00,

70
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,370
then a couple of hours of category,
a little bit north of Kabul and all of a

71
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:19,330
sudden it's dark.
So I'm looking for my telephone and my

72
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:21,030
bag.
I'm searching for that lesson.

73
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,040
I felt something soft and I put the
light of my phone on it.

74
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:29,410
That is a hand that chopped up,
hence sitting right next to me.

75
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,810
Every hair on my body stood up.
I said,

76
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:36,370
oh my God.
They said to drive it.

77
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:38,380
I said,
stop the car.

78
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,610
I said,
dad as a hand.

79
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,320
And the other seat,
and he looks at me,

80
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:43,660
he goes,
oh,

81
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,000
I've,
when I was coming to pick you up,

82
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:49,060
there was a suicide bombing.
The windows were open and probably some

83
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,480
lymph fluid.
So I said,

84
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:53,680
well,
get it out of the car.

85
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:54,281
And he goes,
no,

86
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:55,420
no,
I can stop right now.

87
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:58,180
I got to take you there.
And then I'll bury it somewhere.

88
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,950
I still think about that.
It just,

89
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,960
you honestly,
you never think something like this

90
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:16,780
could ever happen.
And then when it does happen and then

91
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:21,430
you have to live with it and it just to
see either this was planned to scare me

92
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,730
or if it was a fact,
the truth he was telling me

93
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,550
in either case it showed to me how cold
and callous people have become,

94
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:37,681
how nonimportant death is an unlimited.
The car is like not a big deal.

95
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,840
It just to him it was like,
yeah,

96
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,820
another one,
uh,

97
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,470
you know,
another problem that we just got to take

98
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:47,800
care of.
And the numbness that people have seen

99
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:52,801
so much death and destruction that um,
it just wasn't nothing.

100
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,930
I don't know which one was worse.
Finding data or finding his reaction to

101
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:00,130
it.
Um,

102
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,480
a lot of little stories like that
happen.
