1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,810
Well,
I've been very,

2
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:12,360
very involved with star,
uh,

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,930
since,
since I first came because the mission

4
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:19,890
there was to transform it from a tabloid
into a glossy magazine,

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,090
which is totally necessary because after
us came out,

6
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:29,091
it really changed the landscape of
celebrity reporting and tabloids as

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,710
we're vulnerable because as newspapers,
young people aren't for a long time,

8
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:39,120
haven't been reading newspapers and that
trend has been continuing and tablets

9
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:40,560
are really a newspaper.
So,

10
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,580
um,
star need to star needed to get a

11
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:48,510
younger audience and needed to go more
upscale in order to attract advertising,

12
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:51,900
which it couldn't carry is a tabloid.
And so,

13
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,270
uh,
American media decided that they were

14
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:58,310
going to need this transition.
It never been done before and Anna,

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,500
it's never going to be done again.
There's no other tablet that really is

16
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:04,950
convertible.
So that was a real challenge.

17
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:09,030
But I was very interested in that
challenge and I came in and we did that

18
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:12,030
and it took,
I would say it took a good four years to

19
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,020
really get accepted.

20
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,350
It's only been in the last,
this last year that I feel we've really

21
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:19,800
patched past the tipping point.
We've gained this whole new younger

22
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:23,490
audience.
We've got the advertisers to except the

23
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:28,491
magazine and advertising's up 26%.
And so it's really in the last year I've

24
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:32,790
been able even know I was,
I the other magazine I've been fairly

25
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:36,780
involved with for a while it's shape
because it really needed to also

26
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:39,510
transition.
And a couple of years ago it brought in

27
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:44,511
a new editor and you creative director
and we redesigned and and read is we re

28
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,160
um,
kind of not just did a physical

29
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:51,570
redesigned but kind of really reformat
it the way we were presenting the

30
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:55,500
editorial so and the text.
And so,

31
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:57,330
and that's actually worked out very,
very well.

32
00:01:57,331 --> 00:01:59,190
They're having their best year ever now
too.

33
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,670
So,
but until this last year I really didn't

34
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,180
get a chance to,
to oversee and focus on any other

35
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:08,520
magazines.
And now because star has had that

36
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:12,480
tipping point,
I've been able to pull back from it and

37
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,470
not be so involved in the day to day.
And I've been much more involved with,

38
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:20,370
I'm working on country weekly,
which is also needed to be redesigned.

39
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,290
I don't have updated,
uh,

40
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,510
it's fun magazine,
natural health,

41
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,100
men's fitness,
and even getting a little bit involved

42
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:32,580
with the myth that the men's muscle
titles,

43
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,730
which is very brand new to me.
So,

44
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,640
and then I work a lot also on doing
still a lot of the marketing and

45
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,320
advertising

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,350
and working with publishers.
