1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,040
I tried to hear everything that's
happening and that that can be very,

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,380
very difficult.
And,

3
00:00:09,381 --> 00:00:10,650
and someone who tells you,
Oh,

4
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:14,310
I hear everything that's happening on
stage is lying cause there's,

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,460
there's almost no way I think to really
do that.

6
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:19,680
But as an exercise,
I do try to identify,

7
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:20,970
okay,
what does that musician,

8
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:24,360
the third flute playing?
And I tried to make sure I can hear

9
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:27,090
that,
but you have to hear what's going on

10
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:29,840
because if you're,
there's a way I,

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,910
I've used the analogy,
it's like it's like a ball,

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,750
a very big ball.
You can affect the way the ball rolls

13
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:39,980
and you can change the direction that
the ball is rolling if it's already is,

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,040
if it's already in motion,
but you can't suddenly have a turn,

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,460
an abrupt angle.
There's a natural way that the,

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,730
the ball can be guided.
So even though you're steering the ball,

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,450
there's a natural momentum that the ball
has that you can't interfere with.

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,550
So if the orchestra has a certain flow,
you can affect the flow.

19
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:02,280
But there's a natural way to do that.
And there's a way that actually would

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,100
interrupt the natural flow.
So it's not that you can just do

21
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:08,520
whatever you want.
You have to take into account what is

22
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:10,870
happening and what is being offered from
the players.

23
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:14,010
So that means really being in touch with
what they're doing and hearing them as

24
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:16,740
well as you can.
And it's surprisingly difficult to,

25
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:20,130
to really identify not even with two or
three or four lines,

26
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:24,470
but even just one line to really hear
what the,

27
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,170
the will and the,
and the sense that the players are

28
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:32,010
giving to one line to really listen to
that and to actually be able to react to

29
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:34,350
it in a meaningful way is surprisingly
difficult.

30
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,370
Well,
that's difficult.

31
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:40,830
And,
and what happens is,

32
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,620
um,
if there's more than one current,

33
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:49,380
if they're conflicting currents onstage,
then you have to make a choice.

34
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,980
You have to either give in or insist.
And for the other musicians on stage,

35
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,000
if they sense two currents,
if they say for example,

36
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:03,240
if I show one thing and they hear a
response to that,

37
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:07,920
that is not in sync,
then they have a dilemma they have to

38
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:09,510
choose.
Do I go with what I see from the

39
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:13,080
conductor or do I go with what I hear?
And so I very often tell,

40
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,500
tell the orchestra's,
even the New York Philharmonic,

41
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:17,334
I say,
you know,

42
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,320
I really want you to play with my bead.
It's not that I care about.

43
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:25,950
You're following me that precisely.
It's just that I want to take the

44
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:30,690
element of choice out of the question so
that people are not forced to decide,

45
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:32,790
okay,
do I follow him or do I not follow him?

46
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,010
There has to be just one current.
Of course,

47
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,600
mistakes happen,
accidents happen.

48
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:40,230
If something goes wrong then you just
have to use your sense and that's based

49
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:41,910
on experience.
Either you given,

50
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,030
sometimes it's better to give in and
allow it to sort of write itself over

51
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,520
time.
Other Times you sort of dig your heels

52
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:48,450
in and you just say,
okay,

53
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:49,890
no,
this is where it is.

54
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,770
And it creates a discomfort,
an uncomfortable moment.

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,633
But,
um,

56
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,070
you try to use your best sense and,
uh,

57
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,050
I couldn't say it's a always one way or
it's,

58
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,280
or it's always another way is you just
have to figure out what the best way to

59
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:05,400
get out of those situations.
And hopefully they're not too frequent.
