1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,900
You know that old saying about the Fox
guarding the hen house.

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,620
So I like to tell it for a different
version of that story with the

3
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:14,780
backstory,
you know,

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,120
where the hens,
regular people trying to live our lives

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,780
and we had a guard of the hen house.
It's the government wasn't perfect

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,880
but it,
but it did a reasonable job of

7
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:29,940
protecting us from each other of
guarding equality.

8
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:32,150
Make sure,
making sure none of the hens were

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:38,220
pecking the other hands too much.
And then came along last 30,

10
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:40,310
40 years,
uh,

11
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,570
uh,
Fox and the Fox is big business and

12
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:47,571
wealthy people and the Fox didn't like
know the guard because the fox kind of

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,020
one of the hens to itself,
it was what the Fox do it bit by bit

14
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:55,680
that garden,
like it argued the government was bad,

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,790
government was the enemy had defunded
government at fought for lower taxes so

16
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:00,930
government could do less stuff.

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,860
Then the guard starts stumbling away and
bleeding out

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,560
off the scene.
Hens are unguarded and the Fox presents

19
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:12,780
itself to the hands and says what a
shame.

20
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,440
Government is just not,
not what it used to be.

21
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:18,780
Not,
not solving and not protecting you,

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,640
not fighting for it.
So efficient.

23
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:21,600
It's so,
gosh,

24
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:23,040
that's so sad.
Well,

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,460
let me step in and,
and,

26
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,331
and I'm,
I'm,

27
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:27,750
I'm,
I'm rich and I'm here to help.

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,370
Well,
rich people and wealthy corporations

29
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,600
spent a generation waging a war on
government,

30
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,630
defunding government,
allowing social problems to fester and

31
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:46,740
allowing their own profits to soar.
And then with government weekend social

32
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:48,990
problems multiplying and their own
pockets full,

33
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,750
they reinvent themselves as the new
replacement of government,

34
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,010
which is,
you know,

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,590
instead of trickle down economics,
we now have trickled down,

36
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:58,530
change,
let them make their fortune and you

37
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:00,930
know,
and then they'll just throw some social

38
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:02,220
change down from the mountain.

39
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,080
Well,
we have to decide in America,

40
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,950
that's the kind of change we want.
Uh,

41
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,590
but what I do know is if you project
that kind of change backwards throughout

42
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:13,590
time,
we wouldn't have created most of the

43
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,330
change that we all take for granted
today.

44
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:16,050
I mean,
if,

45
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,450
if,
uh,

46
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,511
you know,
there,

47
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:20,430
there would frankly have been no new
deal.

48
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:25,320
There'd be no modern American economy if
we had depended on the powerful to throw

49
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:28,170
down scraps.
Many of the most important things in

50
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:32,400
American life had to be taken from the
powerful and given to the mini.

51
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,190
And it's,
it's time that we reclaim that heritage.

52
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:36,990
Again,
I think it's hard to understand why

53
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:41,991
populism is rising throughout the world
without reckoning with the role of a

54
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:47,091
class of global one percenters who are
remote from their communities,

55
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,030
more connected to each other then to the
communities they live in,

56
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,470
um,
and seemingly devoted to profit and

57
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:56,970
returns above all else.

58
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,310
The fascinating and complicated thing
about this global populace moment is

59
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,750
that it takes very different forms.
I mean,

60
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,650
here there's a very strong racial
dynamic to it that is at the heart of

61
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:09,760
it.
Um,

62
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,580
there are other places where that's less
of a factor.

63
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,500
In some places it's about,
you know,

64
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:18,070
internal racial things and other places
about immigration and some places it's

65
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:23,071
about all of the above.
But I think what is undeniable in this

66
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:28,141
country is that for 30 or 40 years,
many people on the left and right have

67
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:33,190
felt that things were not going right,
that the country wasn't working for

68
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:34,570
them,
that it felt rig to them,

69
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:39,100
that it felt impossible to secure the
life that they were promised by this

70
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:40,500
country.
Um,

71
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,060
and to give their children something
better than they had.

72
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,810
And that all that,
while there was a lot of rich explaining

73
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:53,310
to those people by the American elite
that no,

74
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:53,490
no,
no,

75
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,330
no,
things are great trades,

76
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:58,780
good trades going to not non trade
trade's great cause we perfect.

77
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,030
So we'll lift everybody up.
Globalization.

78
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:01,864
Perfect.
It's great.

79
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,030
Look there's a couple of bumps but no
worries.

80
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:06,280
And the in the aggregate all will be
well.

81
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:08,080
I mean as though anybody lives in the
aggregate,

82
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,330
um,
tech don't,

83
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,051
ah,
don't worry.

84
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,640
Don't worry about that fact that,
you know,

85
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:14,620
everything got automated in your jobs.
All went to Taiwan.

86
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,620
Don't worry about it.
We'll be better off on the whole.

87
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,810
And there was just a lot of this kind of
rich planning.

88
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:22,600
I grew up and I remember studying these,
this stuff in college,

89
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:26,380
when I took economics classes,
like I went to the University of

90
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:28,780
Michigan,
I was sitting in Michigan and Econ,

91
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,460
econ 101 and I remember getting this
lecture on how all this stuff was for

92
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:35,950
the good.
As we'd better off and right around us

93
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,980
all around us in Michigan in 1999,
the state was falling apart these long

94
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:48,361
tectonic shifts where basically like
work was disappearing and trade was not

95
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:50,590
benefiting most people.

96
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,790
And globalization was not a walk in the
park and aggregate effects.

97
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,950
We're not really have any comfort to
anybody.

98
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,340
And how was it possible at the
University of Michigan in 1999 with all

99
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:06,070
of that evidence all around us that we
could sit in an intellectual cocoon and

100
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:08,800
explained to ourselves that,
you know,

101
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,900
rising tides lift all boats essentially.
Um,

102
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,700
there is a way in which American elites,
and this is not just a couple of greedy

103
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:19,540
hedge fund billionaires,
American,

104
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:24,541
the American intelligentsia also has
been complicit in a false story about

105
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,760
air,
all things working out for people over

106
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,440
the last generation.
That wasn't true.

107
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,460
And I think people felt that and
revolted against it.

108
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:37,150
And it's really,
really unfortunate that particularly in

109
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:42,151
the trump movement,
the someone who actually tapped into

110
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:44,080
that intuition,
people have,

111
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:48,070
that elites weren't maybe as sincere and
fighting for them as,

112
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,340
as they claimed that Donald Trump,
instead of seizing on that anger and

113
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,320
channeling at the institutions and
people who had actually done that

114
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,630
instead in this cowardly and sad and
lowly and hateful way,

115
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,440
deflected that anger onto Muslims and
immigrants and women and people of Color

116
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:07,700
and whatever,
you know,

117
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,210
that's the,
the ultimate and tragic nonsequitor of

118
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:12,440
American politics today.

119
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,480
People are correctly,
people correctly feel screwed by an

120
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:22,481
economic order that doesn't have as much
space for regular people to make a life

121
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:28,540
as it used to.
But they have been led by a phony

122
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:34,250
billionaire real estate developer to
feel as though those problems were

123
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:37,370
caused not by Goldman Sachs,
but by black people.

124
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,200
And that is the tragedy of this moment.
And that's why it's going to take

125
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,650
someone on the democratic side who was
actually able to speak to the concerns

126
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:53,300
of regular people about being shut out.
By the way,

127
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,280
there's more shout out people on the
democratic voter base than the

128
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:02,870
Republican voter base.
But the Democrats I think have struggled

129
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,380
to speak in the language of people who
feel left out by the future.

130
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,290
Um,
socially,

131
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,760
many of the most prominent Democrats,
it's just they don't know and live among

132
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:17,840
those people.
You can,

133
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,450
you can have a lot of heart and you can
have a good speech writer.

134
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,370
Um,
but you either live in a world that has

135
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,640
more Goldman Sachs people in it,
or a world that has more union

136
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:29,700
organizers in it.
It's,

137
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,540
it's,
it's just as your real friends,

138
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,370
as your,
as your real fellow travelers.

139
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,190
And I think people are actually good at
sniffing who's who.

140
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,480
And I think the Democratic Party needs
to get serious about being the party of,

141
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,810
of regular people who feel shut out by
this age and that that must mean not

142
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:50,150
being the party of Goldman Sachs in any
way.

143
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,110
Mm.
