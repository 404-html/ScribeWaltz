1
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,230
The academy is a huge enterprise in,
in the United States there are 6,500

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,290
institutions that do higher education.
There are public and private.

3
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,110
There are community colleges to research
universities.

4
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:23,940
They're there,
they're large,

5
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,320
they're small,
they're urban,

6
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:30,321
they're rural,
so the the university and college and

7
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:34,170
Community College,
the Higher Education Complex in the

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,170
United States is unbelievably diverse
and by the way that's one of its great

9
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:42,990
strengths is because it is
decentralized,

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,371
it,
it's.

11
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:48,371
It's highly competitive on one hand,
highly cooperative on the other and it's

12
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:54,681
hard to think of any question to which
there's a single answer for the entire

13
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,120
complex realism of higher education that
that having been said,

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,750
if I were to try to focus on one issue
that that loomed large across the entire

15
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:14,730
spectrum of the 6,500 schools that are
operating in higher education.

16
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,090
I would say that there is at this moment
in this country which which has without

17
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,200
question a higher education system.
That is the envy of the world.

18
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,830
There is in process a tectonic change in
the way our society views higher

19
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:38,370
education and it is not for the good.
There is bias and law judge,

20
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,940
a subliminal devaluation of higher
education even as we overtly as a

21
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:51,420
society say how important it is,
so we're disinvesting in it.

22
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,910
We're beginning to treat it more as a
private good.

23
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:58,060
Then as a public good,
and and this in the long term is is

24
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,750
quite a challenge to the higher
education establishment,

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,130
but I went to school here in New York
state.

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,050
There was a New York state regents
scholarship that you could win as a,

27
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:17,051
as a competitive prize that paid for
room board and tuition for you to go to

28
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:22,491
a private school and today the aid
that's given by New York state is,

29
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:27,930
is a small fraction of the cost of
attending anything but a public school.

30
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,350
So it's a small fraction of paying the
cost of attendance at one of the elite

31
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,230
private colleges or universities of New
York state.

32
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,170
Now,
part of that is because what we expect

33
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:44,760
from higher education has has,
has gone up that that the cost of a

34
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,630
private education has gone up greatly,
but,

35
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,870
but that's because the quality of what's
being provided has gone up greatly.

36
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,190
That the diversity of courses,
the,

37
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,470
the,
the ratio of faculty to students that we

38
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,660
as a society have have not continued the
willingness we showed after World War

39
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,280
Two to invest heavily in that higher
education,

40
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,950
whether it be in the research side or in
making it available to students and,

41
00:03:15,951 --> 00:03:20,951
and that in the long term is a major
mistake by public policy makers.
