1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,593
Yeah.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,390
When I graduated from Trinity College in
Law,

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,200
I was fortunate enough to go to the
Harvard law school at a particularly

4
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:18,520
interesting time.
I'm the class of 68 so I was there in

5
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:23,521
1967 and 68 and that was a time when
young Americans are questioning the war

6
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:26,530
in Vietnam.
They were interested in civil rights

7
00:00:26,531 --> 00:00:29,560
programs in the south than Martin Luther
King was assassinated.

8
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:34,561
That here and Robert Kennedy just after
I graduated and I came back to Ireland,

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,620
imbued with that sense that young people
can make a difference.

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,120
And I was elected to the Irish Senate
very shortly afterwards and the first

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,100
measure bill in the parliament that I
introduced to the age of 25 was a bill

12
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:51,970
to legalize family planning.
It seemed to me to be very simple

13
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:56,971
because married women were not allowed
to have the contraceptive pill unless

14
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,960
they had cycle regulation problems and
it must have been the weather.

15
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,130
But there was a phenomenon of many
married women having cycle regulation

16
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:11,131
problems and also you couldn't
buy or sell the pill.

17
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:14,200
It was a criminal offense.
But if you could manage to get a pill,

18
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:14,741
oh,
sorry,

19
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,780
the condom,
and you could use a condom,

20
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:19,780
but not by herself.
And I felt this is something that just

21
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:24,100
needs to be straightened out.
And I completely underestimated the

22
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:29,130
grave offense and a concern that I
caused to a whole range of people.

23
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:34,170
I was denounced by bishops and priests
from the pulpit,

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,830
and I was denounced by newspapers.
I was an outcast for awhile,

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,920
and it was a very troubling experience.
I kind of wobbled because I'd been used

26
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:47,200
to being more or less reasonably admired
and liked.

27
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,780
I was doing well,
and suddenly I was actually a heat

28
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:53,080
figure and got hate mail.
It was very good for me because I

29
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:57,250
learned a lesson,
but a few really believe that something

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,190
is important and it's true.
Then stick to it.

31
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,780
Go through with a,
pay the price,

32
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,570
be unpopular.
Don't be arrogant,

33
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,210
but sometimes you have to stick to your
principles.
