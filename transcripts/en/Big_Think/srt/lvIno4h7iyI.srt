1
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,330
No,
I don't.

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,540
I don't think that the growth of
nonprofits and specifically

3
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:15,990
environmental nonprofits has diluted
surfrider foundation at all in that back

4
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:18,810
to I love having more help anywhere we
can get it.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,420
The more the merrier.
It's great.

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,520
I think what is changing,
as I mentioned a while ago was a w was

7
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:31,521
everything that happened in the 90s all
the technology we can now in about 14

8
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:35,670
hours send 10,000 emails to government
Schwartzenegger on an issue.

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,640
We can send 20,000 emails to people in
Chile.

10
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:42,540
I mean we can tap people,
we can talk face to face all over the

11
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,400
world using skype.
We do.

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,660
Um,
those things are radically shifting the

13
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,840
toolset,
the capabilities and the power that is

14
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:54,270
at the edge of the network of our
culture.

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,620
So all of a sudden you don't have to be
Rupert Murdoch Buying The Wall Street

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,030
Journal to have your hand on the
joystick.

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,890
You can be 10,000 people in Argentina.
You can do this a lot of different ways

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,310
as long as you understand and implement
technology.

19
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:13,311
One of my favorite things that just came
out was a $99 video player that records

20
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:18,441
on flash the size of a cell phone.
They gave them away as freebies at this

21
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:21,120
conference that I'm at right now.
Very,

22
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:22,110
very powerful tool.

23
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,060
No,
I think something has shifted in the

24
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:38,010
last 12 months,
which is radically different than it was

25
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:40,320
before.
It used to be that business was bad,

26
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,320
government was slow,
Ngo Dash virus.

27
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:45,780
We're good.
There are where all the smart people

28
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:48,060
we're,
et cetera in anything with a corporate

29
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:52,590
brand was essentially bad.
And what has happened in the last 12

30
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:54,630
months is that governments are still
slow.

31
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:58,350
I think they'll always be slow.
Business has flipped from one of their

32
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,170
emotions to the other emotion and they
only have two emotions.

33
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,650
And the one emotion that they were in
was fear.

34
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,030
They didn't understand the environment,
they didn't understand the cost of all

35
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,990
these things,
and they do now.

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,810
So you have Jim Rogers,
CEO of Duke Energy,

37
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,050
amazing guy making amazing statements.
Walmart is making amazing strides to

38
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:22,110
dupont making amazing strides.
So now they flipped over to their other

39
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:24,120
convenient emotion,
which is greed.

40
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,900
Business has the capital,
they have the reach,

41
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:29,640
they have the infrastructure,
they have the,

42
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,710
uh,
distribution channel to consumers.

43
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,390
Business will drive the green movement.
It's also what Thomas Friedman saying,

44
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:40,570
and a new kind of green is the new red,
white and blue people are saying green

45
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:41,550
was the new gold,
et cetera.

46
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:44,880
And it's not as simple as that.
Businesses are cashing in.

47
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,350
That's not the message at all.
Businesses will cash in regardless.

48
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,950
The point is that the globe is in a
crisis mode.

49
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:54,960
It's red lining.
And,

50
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,040
and businesses cannot sustain their
model unless adapt.

51
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,180
And they are much quicker to adapt than
a government,

52
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,100
which we're seeing all over the world.
