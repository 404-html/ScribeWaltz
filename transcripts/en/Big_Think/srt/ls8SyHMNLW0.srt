1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,280
Ambiguity,
paradox,

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:03,690
confusion are,
uh,

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,010
also some of my favorite subjects.
Um,

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,490
uh,
the two lions that we often see in the

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,271
Far East,
uh,

6
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:12,950
it's,
uh,

7
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,950
they're supposed to represent confusion
and paradox and they guard the gate to

8
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:22,260
heaven.
So if you want to get to heaven quote,

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,890
you have to be comfortable with
confusion and with paradox and one

10
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:31,770
example of being comfortable with
paradox as a,

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,800
we often hear that we should accept life
the way it is and uh,

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,830
but of course there are many things that
we don't accept a,

13
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:44,640
so we can have the paradox of accepting
that we can't accept.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I mean,
we can't accept violence against women

15
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:53,001
or children or even against other men,
but we can accept that we can't accept

16
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:53,964
that.
So,

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,250
uh,
the paradox in this case,

18
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:59,390
it's extremely important.
Uh,

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,580
so it's not a whitewash to say,
hey,

20
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:03,690
I accept everything.

21
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,730
Uh,
that's nonsense to begin with.

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,800
Uh,
but where do you parts of,

23
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,780
where do you say that you accept
something,

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,320
something or not?
And being comfortable with the paradox

25
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,160
of accepting,
but also accepting that we do not accept

26
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:18,630
certain things.
Uh,

27
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:21,180
that's,
that's how paradox plants plays itself

28
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:25,770
out and confusion,
is that we live in an extremely complex

29
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:29,520
world and uh,
it's not a straight and narrow.

30
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Most things have an upside and a
downside and to weigh them out is,

31
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,930
it's very difficult,
you know,

32
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:37,620
we,
we,

33
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,620
we would love to have a very simple
answer and white answer is a good for me

34
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:44,760
as a bad for me,
but,

35
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,860
uh,
that's very rarely the case.

36
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,310
We evolved to want to have simple
answers because the brain then doesn't

37
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:57,450
have to work overtime to analyze any
situation and the more complex the

38
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:01,410
situation and the more confusing,
the more the brain has to work.

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,260
That's why we don't like confusion.
We want to have simple,

40
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:06,360
straightforward,
black and white answers,

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,450
but that's probably not going to happen
for anything.

42
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,530
I personally don't like the word right
and wrong,

43
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,570
uh,
because for different people,

44
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:19,560
right and wrong looks very different.
I think that it can be coached and a

45
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:23,850
little bit of a different way.
So I like to look at things that work or

46
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:26,760
that don't work.
I believe that human beings

47
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,790
fundamentally want life to flourish.
We love and when we see life flourish,

48
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:36,921
be it a new flower or a tree sprouting
in the spring time or any beautiful new

49
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:40,700
thing that we experience a new baby,
it's,

50
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,660
it's just we'd love it and we have a
really positive feeling towards when

51
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:49,260
life flourishes,
a so right and wrong,

52
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,350
gets it very much into a mental status.
And we compare to a whole list of what

53
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:58,210
we think is good for live on,
what we think is bad for life.

54
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,640
Uh,
but underlying,

55
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:05,641
I think it's much more interesting to
pay attention to whether something works

56
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,820
to have life flourish or not.
So if you step on an ant,

57
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,490
obviously that doesn't help very much
for life to flourish.

58
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,180
Is it right or wrong to kill a mosquito?
I don't know.

59
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,261
You know,
I mean,

60
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:19,420
in my book,
that's works for me.

61
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:24,421
So the mosquito doesn't give me malaria,
so it helps my life to flourish.

62
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,820
But obviously it doesn't help them.
Mosquitoes life to flourish.

63
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,000
So,
uh,

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,650
I,
I believe it's much more valuable to

65
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:37,270
recognize it in terms of working and not
working rather than right and wrong.
