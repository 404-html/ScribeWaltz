1
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,500
Oh,
well that's a long story.

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,090
So,
um,

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,440
I was in retailing,
I went to city college and I went to fit

4
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:19,850
and I was in retailing for awhile and I
was working for a company called gimbals

5
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:23,480
in New York City and they were going to
close shop.

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,930
They sold the real estate here right
here on 33rd and Broadway and I was out

7
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:30,140
of a job.
So I said,

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:30,561
Oh,
you know,

9
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:32,540
I've always been,
well I've been working since I'm 16

10
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,880
years old.
I said I was married at the time and I

11
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:38,660
was able to take some time off.
So I took some time off and some friends

12
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:41,570
of mindset to me,
let's open a cabaret.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,501
And I said,
oh,

14
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:46,250
that might be fun.
So we opened this cabaret on Eighth

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,060
Avenue and 26th street and they named a
caroline's.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,930
Well,
once my name was on the door,

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,720
then I had a little more than invested
interest in it.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,771
So I said,
Oh,

19
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:55,880
this might be fun,
you know,

20
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:59,090
helping run this club.
So we started with lots of cabaret acts

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,300
and when that quite,
it really didn't hit me.

22
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:04,250
I mean,
it wasn't contemporary enough for me at

23
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:07,010
that time.
Then we started to book comedians like

24
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:11,270
Jay Leno and Jerry Seinfeld and Garry
shandling and billy crystal and peewee

25
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,640
Herman.
And that was the start of,

26
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,390
of Caroline's as a comedy club.

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,430
Oh,

28
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,980
watching the David Letterman show that
was on it,

29
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,521
you know,
12,

30
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:24,750
30 at night.
Uh,

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,850
Jay Leno was kind of a regular on that
show.

32
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:27,720
So I kind of Said,
Oh,

33
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,720
let me tie it into one if we can get him
on the show when he said Caroline's and

34
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:35,190
he can mention that he's there and then
people come out to see him.

35
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:38,280
It was a way of,
of saving with advertising,

36
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:40,890
but getting the word out,
I guess it was called marketing at that

37
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:44,490
time,
so kind of we did it that way and I kind

38
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:49,491
of built our reputation.
He was a working comedian.

39
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:56,000
He worked around the country.
He had a small following at that time,

40
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:59,150
but they came out to him and it was kind
of my contemporaries at the time.

41
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,080
Jay and I are,
you know,

42
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,050
like the same age and his clientele was
the same age as that time and,

43
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,110
and they came out to Sam,
followed by people that were on the rise

44
00:02:09,111 --> 00:02:14,000
like Jerry Seinfeld and Garry shandling,
Sandra Bernhard,

45
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,560
Rita rudner.
I mean,

46
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:19,070
it's everybody that's kind of made it,
came through the club

47
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,063
I think.
Um,

48
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,000
I think I was talking to an agent at
that time at Apa and Jerry was there and

49
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:29,751
he said,
well,

50
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,580
you know,
agents are always trying to sell you a

51
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,940
so talent.
Anyway,

52
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:36,350
so he suggested that we,
we booked Jerry and we did A.

53
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,010
Jerry worked at the club for a number of
years and I remember him doing a few new

54
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:42,140
year's eves there.
So it was Kinda fun years ago.

55
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,740
I think a lot of people came through our
system,

56
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:50,041
you know,
we,

57
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,680
there were a lot of people where we had
them as we,

58
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,960
we put them as opening acts.
I mean,

59
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:57,240
Chris,
Chris Rock was a young kid when he

60
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:59,650
started to work at the club.
Um,

61
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,030
and when he last appeared at a club,
we had a,

62
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,710
a young comedian called Wanda Sykes and
Wanda,

63
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,030
we put wander as an opening act and
introduced to the Chris and after that,

64
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,340
you know,
she kind of,

65
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,950
her career was made and she worked.
She worked a lot with Chris with Chris

66
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,690
Rock.
Maybe I take it for granted.

67
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:19,600
The people have come through there.
I mean lots of producers.

68
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,470
Larry David and Michael Patrick King,
Jon Stewart,

69
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,430
Jon Stewart who was a writer on a TV
show that I had for a and a for six

70
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:30,490
years.
So it was also him and Michael Patrick

71
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,330
King.
I mean,

72
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,000
when I look back at some of the fun
things that we did,

73
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,740
you know,
when the early nineties,

74
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,840
you can see where these guys were headed
to,

75
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:39,090
after that.
Um,

76
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,290
we,
we start a lot of people at.

77
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,970
There's a young woman,
Lisa Lampanelli,

78
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,910
we,
we let her come in and let her perform

79
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:49,840
there and build her following.
And she went on to do not to be very

80
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:51,880
funny lady.
So things like that.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,490
Um,
I think how I watch Comedians,

82
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:05,491
I've watched them grow Sunday night.
I was watching the Oscars and I watched

83
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:09,490
John Stewart and I was thinking last
night I wanted to send them a note,

84
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:13,270
you know,
I remember him as a 27 year old kid

85
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,760
standing with me at a bar at the club
that I had at the seaport,

86
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,340
you know,
talking about his mother to me and um,

87
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,650
you know,
just to go back into,

88
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,660
to see how he's grown over the years.
It's just quite amazing.

89
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,710
That's almost 20 years ago when I,
when I met John,

90
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,800
you know,
I did a Kiddie show with John at the sea

91
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:36,700
port on a Saturday morning.
I wish I had the tapes of that right

92
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:37,750
now.
He's grown,

93
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:38,440
he's grown.
He's,

94
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,010
you know,
he's,

95
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,750
he's,
he has his own voice.

96
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,210
He grew into himself.
Um,

97
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,520
he's,
he's just a real,

98
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:46,530
real big,
big

99
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,920
hello.
