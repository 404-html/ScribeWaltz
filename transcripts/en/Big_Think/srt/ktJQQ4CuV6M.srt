1
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,840
I committed myself in,
in my book Keynes,

2
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:16,530
the return of the master to the view
that the blame lies chiefly with the

3
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:19,470
economists.
I because of my,

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,340
uh,
conviction that ideas matter and that

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,930
other people,
they're not just puppets of ideas,

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,050
but what's what goes on in their heads.
What they think about the world is

7
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:35,960
really provided by,
uh,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,310
the thinkers and in this case the
economist.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,820
And that shapes their actions to an
extraordinary degree.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,680
It's not enough to say,
look,

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,130
bankers were,
were,

12
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:50,130
were immensely greedy and that they
committed lots of frauds.

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,100
I mean that's not that they were set
free.

14
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:58,101
That sort of particular proclivity in
human nature was set free to do its best

15
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:01,320
and its worst.
Well who set it free?

16
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,500
Well obviously regulators and
governments,

17
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,790
but politicians and regulators or
consumers of ideas,

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,950
they never have any ideas of their own.

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,230
Um,
if it take too much,

20
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:15,750
too much,
like hard work to develop ideas or you

21
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:18,960
get them on,
you get them off menus and you pick the

22
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:21,390
ones that suit you and say they were
the,

23
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,290
so there was this chain and I think that
was the important thing.

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,520
If you like financial intermediation,
financial services was set free to go

25
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:35,280
beyond their rightful place.
A place by which they had been

26
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:39,270
restrained in the past.
And I think in the periods when they

27
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:42,020
were restrained,
economies were much more stable and

28
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:42,570
they,
they,

29
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,290
they became later on.
So that's my basic answer.

30
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,940
It's the ideas that are important.

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,580
By the time you're in a hole,
I mean the crisis remember came on very,

32
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:59,370
very suddenly.
You could say it had been germinating

33
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:02,490
for the previous year.
Of course people were alert to things

34
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:06,870
even in 2007 but you know,
then hit with a thunder clap.

35
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,030
And within a month it was as though the
whole of the western banking system was

36
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:15,360
about to be wiped out.
And that's when they came in very,

37
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:17,600
very fast.
Governments and,

38
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,141
and,
and,

39
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:18,601
and,
and,

40
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:22,260
and central banks.
And then after that they have to say,

41
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:24,330
okay,
now we're in this whole,

42
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,960
how do we sort of nudge,
nudge economies out of it?

43
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:29,530
Because economies with,
by this time,

44
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,940
our life support system,
the banks are on life support system and

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,850
the real economy was starting to be on a
life support system.

46
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,240
So Keynes I think would have,
would have actually approved of most of

47
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:39,390
that.

48
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,250
I think some things he would have done
in different way.

49
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,740
But do they go back to the old,
old question?

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,720
Yeah.
It's,

51
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,730
it's,
it's almost no use asking what would he

52
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:51,540
have done in detail because things have
changed.

53
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,400
But it's the spirit,
uh,

54
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,000
his,
his,

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
his analysis and the spirit in which he
would have tackled these problems that

56
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,810
are important.
And I think he would have been on the

57
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:04,260
side of expanding,
uh,

58
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,530
always.
When you're sliding down a rather than a

59
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,810
buttoning up your coats and,
and,

60
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:11,920
and,
and saying,

61
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:12,731
we must,
we must,

62
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:15,280
we must tighten,
tighten our belts.

63
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,550
Cause I think he would have thought that
would have brought to us,

64
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,790
bring us even lower than,
than,

65
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,090
than we,
than we've gone

66
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,520
[inaudible].
