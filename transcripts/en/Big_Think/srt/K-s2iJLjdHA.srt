1
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,440
No,
I wouldn't apply the term journalists to

2
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:13,770
myself.
I think we operate with some,

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,790
a journalistic practices,
but by no means what I carry that title.

4
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,860
I think that's a,
a terrible question that's often asked

5
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,490
by a sort of mainstream media for trying
to grasp this.

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,430
They're not,
it's not mutually exclusive.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,490
There is journalism that appears on
blogs.

8
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:40,340
So I guess that's blogging and
journalism.

9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,680
Um,
and then there are sites like mine that

10
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:45,380
are journalistic but,
uh,

11
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:48,170
you know,
aren't sort of hard fast sticking to

12
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:51,470
that definition.
And then I think you have random

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,120
rambling 13 year olds who are printing
whatever idea pops in their head.

14
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,370
And uh,
I think that's just blogging.

15
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,361
Um,
you know,

16
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:04,361
I think every mainstream publication out
there from time to the New York Times is

17
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:10,571
trying to jump on this blogging
phenomenon and they are using journalism

18
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:14,090
to fuel that.
It just happens to appear online in

19
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:14,660
different forms.
