1
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,060
And I fear that one consequences to your
back,

2
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:14,970
you got a call is that we are much less
likely to intervene.

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,010
Um,
on the one hand there's just a shortage

4
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:18,360
of troops.
You know,

5
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:20,520
everybody's preoccupied in Iraq or to
some extent,

6
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,000
Afghanistan.
Um,

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,280
on the other hand,
there is a,

8
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:24,380
um,
uh,

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,280
no more stomach for military action.
I think people have just had it with,

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,720
with these adventures overseas want the
troops home and are not about to launch

11
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:35,260
into another one.
Um,

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,540
and,
and in a third perspect the Bush

13
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:43,260
administration is discredited the
concept of humanitarian intervention by

14
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:47,610
trying to justify the Iraqi war after
the fact as a humanitarian intervention

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,540
when we all know that at the time it was
supposedly to have to find the

16
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:56,340
nonexistent weapons of mass destruction
or was to attack the nonexistent links

17
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:58,000
with international terrorism.
Um,

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,170
but if,
um,

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,350
if we knew that there were no weapons of
mass destruction,

20
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:03,510
if it was clearly there was no all kind
of connection,

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,000
um,
Bush would not have gone in just because

22
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:07,020
Saddam was a tyrant.

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,940
Um,
but after the fact by trying to justify

24
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:14,550
the Iraq war as a humanitarian
intervention,

25
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,230
one that I don't think is justified
because bad is a tyrant,

26
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,430
is Saddam was,
there was not the mass slaughter at the

27
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:22,530
time that would have justified him.
Manager intervention.

28
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,710
Bush has given the term,
given the concept of bad name.

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,710
Um,
he's really tired.

30
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,180
What is I think a very,
you know,

31
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:35,181
a high minded concept with his fairly
based political needs.

32
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,460
And in the process,
I think it's people say like the people

33
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:41,280
in our four core paying the price.
Um,

34
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,530
because you know,
why is the international community only

35
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:47,550
willing to go into dark for with the
consent of the Sudanese government,

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,860
you know,
consent that has been held for a very

37
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:50,890
long time.
Um,

38
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,880
it's because there is no more,
you know,

39
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,130
stomach,
there's no more capacity to,

40
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:58,840
to use military force,
but also because people are not

41
00:01:58,841 --> 00:02:01,230
skeptical of this concept of
humanitarian or convention.

42
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,920
And so in that sense,
the people that are four or of eastern

43
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:08,100
Congo or,
or others facing mass atrocities are

44
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:11,250
very much paying the price of this,
um,

45
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,750
this cheap resorts to war and an effort
to justify it after the fact,

46
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,050
as a humanitarian action.
