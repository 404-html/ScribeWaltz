1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,760
I think a lot of people just assume that
the way to make more intelligent just to

2
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:17,640
make them more human,
but

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,690
I think that's a very dubious
assumption.

4
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,130
I think we're much better off with tools
with colleagues.

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,460
We can make tools that are smart as the
Dickens and use them and understand what

6
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:38,760
their limitations are without giving
them ulterior motives,

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,240
purposes,
a drive to exist and to compete and to

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,560
beat the others.
Those are features that don't play any

9
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,680
crucial role in the competences of
artificial intelligence,

10
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,840
so for Heaven Sakes,
don't bother putting them in.

11
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,170
Leave all that out and what we have is
very smart things that we can treat like

12
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:13,050
slaves and it's quite all right to treat
them as less because they.

13
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,330
They don't have feelings.
They're not conscious.

14
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,350
You can turn them off.
You can tear them apart the same way you

15
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:22,890
can with an automobile and that's the
way we should keep it.

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,950
Now that we're in the age of intelligent
design,

17
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,670
lots of intelligent designers around.
A lot of them are intelligent enough to

18
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:35,460
realize that Oracle's second rule is
true.

19
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,320
Evolution is cleverer than you are.
That's Francis Crick's,

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,790
famous quip,
and so what they're doing is harnessing

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,880
evolutionary processes to do the heavy
lifting without human help,

22
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,810
so we have all these deep learning
systems and they kind of in the

23
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,140
varieties,
there's basie and networks and and a

24
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,710
reinforcement learning of various sorts
of deep,

25
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,160
deep learning neural networks and what
these computer systems have in common is

26
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:12,540
that they are competent without
comprehension.

27
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,520
Google translate doesn't know what he's
talking about when it translates a bit

28
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:20,400
of Turkish into a bit of English,
doesn't have to.

29
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,130
It's not as good as the translation that
a bilingual can do,

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
but it's good enough for most purposes.
And what's happening in many fields in

31
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:37,740
this new wave of ai is the creation of
systems.

32
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,150
Black boxes where you know that the
probability of getting the right answer

33
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:45,030
is very high.
They are extremely good.

34
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:49,080
They're better than human beings at
churning through the data and coming up

35
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:52,320
with the right answer,
but they don't understand how they do

36
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:56,520
it.
Nobody understands in detail how they do

37
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:57,400
it.
I know,

38
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,080
but he has to.
So we've created entities which are his

39
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:07,081
inscrutable to us as a bird or a mammal
considered as a collection of cells.

40
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:13,450
This inscrutable is still a lot we don't
understand about what makes them tick

41
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,760
and we can use these products,
these intellectual products without

42
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:23,761
knowing quite how they're generated,
but knowing having a good responsible

43
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:29,830
reasons for believing that they will
generate the truth.

44
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:33,220
Most of the time,
no existing computer system,

45
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:37,660
no matter how good it is,
that answering questions like Watson on

46
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:40,600
jeopardy knows how the system is
conscious today,

47
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,970
not close.
And although I think it's possible in

48
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:50,650
principle to make a conscious android,
the conscious robot,

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,020
I don't think it's desirable.
I don't think there would be great

50
00:03:56,021 --> 00:04:01,021
benefits to doing this and there'll be
some significant harms and dangerous to

51
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,980
you could at tremendous expense,
but you'd have to have in fact that

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,560
quite a quite a revolution in in
computer design,

53
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:15,430
which would take you right down,
right down to the very base of the

54
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:15,940
hardware.
