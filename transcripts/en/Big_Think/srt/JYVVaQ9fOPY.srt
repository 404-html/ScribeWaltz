1
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,060
I once was

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,610
doing an article when I was working at
Fortune magazine.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,550
Um,
I did an article about,

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,900
um,
power.

5
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:20,380
I actually did two articles about power
and corporations and I got very

6
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:25,240
interested in psychological testing and
how,

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,190
um,
and,

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,760
and because there was a fad,
this was,

9
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,290
I can't remember,
seven or eight years ago,

10
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:33,640
there was a fad for giving psychological
tests to people before they got promoted

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,220
when Myers Briggs tests,
but also other kinds of tests.

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,490
I also was intrigued because back in the
1950s,

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,690
um,
there was a fad for aptitude tests and

14
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:47,080
in fact it was concerned with the
aptitude test fads that cut will you

15
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:50,470
make white to start writing the book
that became the organization man or the

16
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:52,630
articles for fortunate.
It became an organization man.

17
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,760
And included in that book is a chapter
on how to cheat on aptitude tests,

18
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,200
um,
how to take them on,

19
00:00:59,201 --> 00:00:59,920
how to cheat on it.

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,820
So I got interested in the personality
tests and I went to a psychologist

21
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:07,240
friend and I said,
would you teach me how to cheat on

22
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,680
psychology tests?
She said,

23
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:09,514
no,
I can't.

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,570
I mean,
I'm not allowed,

25
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,890
you know,
professional standards.

26
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:12,730
It would,
I can't,

27
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,360
but I'll give you one.
I'll give you the battery that I give,

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,670
uh,
cause she does executive coaching and so

29
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:21,550
on and so forth.
So she gave me this battery of tests and

30
00:01:21,551 --> 00:01:24,340
gave me the feedback and out of it,
and of course I tried to teeth,

31
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,450
but out of it I got some interesting
feedback in which she said that,

32
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,830
that she was intrigued by the way my
mind worked because she found that,

33
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,340
that my mind worked in a way that not
too many other people in her experience

34
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,520
experience did,
is it made all kinds of connections to

35
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:46,780
things in strange ways.

36
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,441
I would,
I,

37
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:52,441
you know,
I leap from a to Z to m to l a to p and

38
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:56,020
I pull in things from a,
from a whole lot of,

39
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,740
uh,
a whole lot of sources and sort of dance

40
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:04,741
around topics until I get it right.
If I get passionate about an idea,

41
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,340
I swarm it.
You know,

42
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,190
I overdo it.
A,

43
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:10,650
I kill it.
And I,

44
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,840
you know,
I just go all over it until I think I

45
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:15,220
understand it.
Uh,

46
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:18,460
or until,
or until I'm bored and I go somewhere

47
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:20,050
else.
So it's that kind of,

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,140
there's not an orderly process.
It's a fairly physical process.

49
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:25,850
I mean,
there's,

50
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,130
I squirm a lot around in my chair when
I'm excited by an idea or you start

51
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:33,070
talking to people like I wanna,
I want to run it by them.

52
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,440
So,
so it's,

53
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,950
it's a kind of a noisy,
um,

54
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,930
a noisy process of seeing connections
and getting excited.

55
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:41,870
Bye.
