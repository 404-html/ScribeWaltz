1
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,040
Now one,
no program,

2
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:15,420
he's actually that easy.
But it's like as far as developed

3
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:18,000
developing programming environments mean
it's,

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,220
it's really made it a lot easier for
people to make you know,

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,030
sites like what 2.0 type sites then then
it would have been five years ago.

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,170
And um,
as I was saying,

7
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:28,330
like when the cost of production,
the ease production,

8
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:30,940
the democratization of production has
really come down.

9
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:31,774
And,
and that's,

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,730
I think,
you know,

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,360
something that like this sort of idea of
like democratization of production is,

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,750
um,
something that like all mediums,

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,770
all media are having trouble with.
And,

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,600
and that to me is like the real story of
not just the Internet but about like the

15
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:50,050
shift from analog to digital is that
we're seeing it becoming with each

16
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:54,910
passing year cheaper and cheaper and
easier and easier for anyone to produce

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,290
anything,
whether it's like,

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,880
you know,
a TV show or a radio show or a podcast

19
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:02,740
or music to make their own music or
create their own,

20
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:03,341
you know,
online,

21
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:04,300
newspaper,
so to speak.

22
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,080
I mean,
all these things that are,

23
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,750
it's become so cheap and easy.
And then you couple that with basically

24
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:14,650
the world's most frictionless
distribution mechanism that,

25
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,360
um,
it's really hard for,

26
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,410
for,
you know,

27
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,320
these,
these media companies which thrived in

28
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:22,690
the age of mechanical production or
reproduction.

29
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,180
Um,
and I read a lot of valter venue me and

30
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,000
like I know all about this stuff.
Um,

31
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,620
you know,
it's hard for them to really thrive in

32
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:32,110
that environment and um,
it's,

33
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:33,520
it's,
you know,

34
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,170
they,
they probably should've started

35
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:37,150
cannibalizing their businesses five
years ago.

36
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:39,340
I think it might be too late.
It's going to be too late for a lot of

37
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:41,220
them.
And the reason why I'm getting,

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,460
you know,
doing something with music,

39
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:44,920
which sounds crazy,
it is crazy.

40
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:47,590
I mean there's no reason why anyone
should get into music business now.

41
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,790
Um,
is that like,

42
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,060
I'm kind of betting that by doing things
that this extremely low,

43
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:54,400
taking advantage and recognizing,
you know,

44
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:56,980
these shifts that like we can do stuff
very cheaply,

45
00:01:56,981 --> 00:02:01,150
very efficiently and that we don't need,
like it's like a record label with like

46
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:03,910
literally without 99% of the other
stuff.

47
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,310
But just like keeping the 1% that's
actually valuable.

48
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,980
Well,
it's more that it's an evolution.

49
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,320
Um,
I mean there are people that I became

50
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:21,321
friends with on prodigy then I'm still
friends with now and that was 1988 or 89

51
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:23,430
that I became friends with these people.
And,

52
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,220
um,
but it's funny that they reconnected

53
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:31,221
with me through my space.
So it's just kind of funny how that all

54
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:33,540
works out.
Um,

55
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,370
I mean I think that it's,
it's a lot,

56
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,770
you know,
a lot of stuff on the internet is not

57
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,550
necessarily a difference in,
in,

58
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,840
it's not a quiet,
it's not like why annotated Lee

59
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,170
different,
it's more,

60
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,630
it's not qualitative to the different,
it's sort of quantitatively different.

61
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:47,640
It's like an evolution of something that
happened before and,

62
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,420
and because of broadband and
improvements and web based technology,

63
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,070
I mean,
you can make the experience better and

64
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:55,450
you can facilitate it and make it,
um,

65
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,550
a lot smoother.

66
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,390
I mean,
it's like,

67
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,100
you know,
Youtube,

68
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,230
you could have done youtube years ago,
more or less,

69
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,630
but what,
what made it possible was,

70
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,600
um,
broadband and so it changed it.

71
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,910
Broadband really changes the way people
interact,

72
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,980
you know?
Uh,

73
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,980
it makes,
it makes,

74
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:14,200
it changes the way people interact with
the Internet because it means a lot of

75
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:16,060
things that were too frustrating to do
before,

76
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:17,770
like download video.
You know,

77
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:20,740
you wouldn't want spend a lot of time on
facebook of facebook if every time,

78
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,110
you know,
you wanted to click on a profile page,

79
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:26,590
you have to wait a minute for it to load
and defeats the purpose.

80
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,900
And a lot of people,
especially young people on facebook and

81
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:29,770
my space,
we'll spend,

82
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,440
we'll look at like 60 or 70 pages in a
session.

83
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,710
And so,
you know,

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,170
they can,
because of that can happen really

85
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:36,970
quickly.
It's only that they actually do want,

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,840
they actually will do.
