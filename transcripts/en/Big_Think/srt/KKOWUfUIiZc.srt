1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,210
I would like to make a distinction in
say between age zero to about 15 or 16

2
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:14,391
years before I was,
before I came in touch with a woman

3
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:18,570
called,
we called [inaudible] in my secondary

4
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:22,350
school in Kenya.
And the time after that,

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,500
um,
before I met sister as is

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:33,000
the Islam of my family was not
political.

7
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,540
So I don't,
I do not remember either my father or my

8
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:40,920
mother saying that a society has to be,
um,

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,730
as you know,
sharia should be the rule of a,

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,370
of a country or a society with one
exception.

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,860
In the one year that we were in Saudi
Arabia,

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,400
there was no distinction between a
secular sphere and,

13
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,143
uh,
and,

14
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,480
and you know,
let's say the film of series a in the

15
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,160
form of,
of God,

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,880
these white intertwined in Islam.
And in the one year that we were in

17
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:13,350
Saudi Arabia,
we lived according to Sharia and the

18
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:16,470
state was run through Islamic law.

19
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,690
So the beheadings,
for instance,

20
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,000
amputations every Friday,
the stonings,

21
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:25,470
that kind of thing that happened.
And there was a distinction,

22
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,970
um,
when atrocities in Somalia were carried

23
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:34,010
out by a secular dictatorships that has,
such as Muhammad [inaudible],

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,690
my mother would denounce,
condemn those atrocities.

25
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,110
But when atrocities were carried out in
the state of Saudi Arabia,

26
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,600
thieves who are amputated,
people's heads were cut off.

27
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,020
That was sharia law.
And that was something that the victim

28
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:51,900
deserved because he violated the law of
God.

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,210
But we left that behind us in when we
left Saudi Arabia and went into

30
00:01:57,211 --> 00:02:00,900
Ethiopia.
My life in Ethiopian,

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,020
in Kenya until my 16th year was I would
just see,

32
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,090
you know,
praying five times a day.

33
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,110
It was very,
of Islam was there socially and

34
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:18,111
culturally it wasn't a political issue.
When I meet in 1985 sisters is a

35
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:22,530
different kind of,
Islam is introduced and different

36
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:25,590
meaning also from the one I knew from my
family,

37
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,750
it was a political Islam.

38
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,570
It was very clear.
It was an individual choice.

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,600
It was about what she referred to as the
inner she had struggling to simply to

40
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:42,510
meet the obligations to make sure that
you play five times instead of three

41
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:44,670
times or two times.
Um,

42
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,640
fast,
all of the Ramadan days,

43
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,790
all 30 of them,
not half a day I say used to do or a

44
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,910
week in a month or something like that.
It's just adhering to the rules every

45
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,680
day.
The rules that allow that have permitted

46
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,190
and trying to abstain from what's
Harambe or what is forbidden.

47
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,170
This is reinforced within the Somali
community because Kenya is a very

48
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:18,370
multicultural place and societies it was
not as Somali but in the Somali space

49
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,970
they were fingers like this man we call
it buffalo song.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He will fast for a hundred days and he
introduced the same kind of radical

51
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,530
political all consuming Islam that
divides the world into we and they and

52
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:41,341
the division started within the Islamic
community so we were those of us who

53
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:43,810
followed the foods rigidly.

54
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:49,070
Those other Muslims who are neglectful
of the rules were considered to be non

55
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:53,680
Muslims hypocrites.
We had all sorts of negative attributes

56
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:57,820
for them and then that they extended to
the non Muslims.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,650
My grandmother represented what's we
generally generally would call

58
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,950
traditional nomadic Somali life and the
values of that tradition,

59
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,270
mainly tribal,
very much we oriented clan oriented.

60
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:19,690
She taught me my blood line because that
is your,

61
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,940
you know,
you cannot survive without your

62
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:23,680
bloodline.
Um,

63
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,160
she taught us all these anecdotes about
how to survive in the desert,

64
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,240
which animals to fear which animals are
not to fear which animals to hunt and

65
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:33,130
eat.
Um,

66
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,260
she was very superstitious when I got
ill or my sister got ill,

67
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,820
she had no access or knowledge of modern
medicine.

68
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,880
So she dealt with the challenges in life
with the seasons,

69
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,460
with droughts.
And then she had superstitious

70
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:52,690
explanations for it.

71
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,090
She was a Muslim,
but a very different Muslim than for

72
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,020
instance,
sees as the sisters Caesar,

73
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,430
how Islam was very much diluted with her
own cultural,

74
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,890
um,
traditional superstitions.

75
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,410
Um,
for instance,

76
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,220
she thought it was a good thing to
celebrate the birthday of the Prophet

77
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,053
Muhammad.
Uh,

78
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,200
which later at sisters isn't vocal song
would say that was a bad thing to do.

79
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,470
Um,
she could not read the Koran.

80
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,010
She had land a few verses by heart.
Just enough to pray.

81
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,560
But she didn't allow us to put the
Qur'an on the ground.

82
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,130
She would make us kiss the Qur'an and
puts it on her the highest surface and

83
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:35,140
faster cleaner has before we touch the
time,

84
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,670
anything like that.
So she was just more of a traditional

85
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,360
Somali nomadic
value system.

86
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,450
With respect to Islam.
We should make a distinction between

87
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,920
Muslims and Islam.
Muslims as individual human beings like

88
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,200
you and me can be influenced.
We're not born.

89
00:05:56,201 --> 00:06:00,410
It's not a genetic discrepancy to be a
Muslim.

90
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,520
You are just an individual human being
and you can be persuaded to change your

91
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:09,050
mind.
And so engage in critical thinking and

92
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,380
change the course of your life is alarm.
Just like Nazis.

93
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:19,130
Him today is a very violent
totalitarian,

94
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,960
the dangerous doctrine.
And the sooner we see it,

95
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,853
the better.

96
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,540
It depends on where they are.
If you are in Europe or in America,

97
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,960
you'll have access to so much education,
so much empirical evidence that you can

98
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:40,720
change your own life if you do certain
things.

99
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,340
I would say to Muslims living in the
West,

100
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:47,500
take advantage,
fully advantage of that.

101
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,700
Um,
develop your mind and your faculties of

102
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,510
critical thinking and look around you
and why are we here?

103
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,260
I'm in Cheyenne answered that question.
What I'm millions of Muslims leaving

104
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:03,220
their own home countries and seeking a
better life in the west.

105
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:07,330
What is it in the West that they're
doing great but we are doing wrong if

106
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:11,710
you are in Muslim countries than there
is a difference that a welcome Muslim

107
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:14,530
countries through oil,
solely citizens,

108
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,060
United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait and so on who can afford because

109
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:23,170
they don't have to go about it.
Didn't have to spend 90% of their time

110
00:07:23,171 --> 00:07:26,590
seeking brad like the poor neighborhoods
of Egypt.

111
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,840
Uh,
that group can make a change and can

112
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:36,100
bring in because we live in the age of
Internet and so on.

113
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,580
They can't translate progressive books,
the Enlightenment Command lots of ideas,

114
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,870
books here into Arabic and bring it and
give it to their own people.

115
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,150
Right now,
the only reading the Koran,

116
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,090
it's,
it's very little to live on

117
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,230
intellectually,
um,

118
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,610
for in poor countries.
Um,

119
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,580
what you see now is that the Islamic
Brotherhood or Brotherhood

120
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,230
organizations,
fundamentalist Islamic organizations are

121
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:09,460
the ones who are providing the care.
And it's an uncorrupted care,

122
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,980
health care,
you know,

123
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,160
food.
Making sure that places are safe,

124
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:22,300
neighborhoods are safe and so on.
And that's can be challenged by,

125
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,740
I would say,
people who will not replace one form of

126
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:28,450
oppression with another form of
oppression.

127
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:35,220
Yeah.
