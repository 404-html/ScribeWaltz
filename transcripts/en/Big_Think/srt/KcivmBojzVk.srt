1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,620
Matthew,
you ask one of the most embarrassing and

2
00:00:06,621 --> 00:00:11,030
deepest theological questions at the
merger at the,

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,210
at the area where physics and philosophy
collide at the present time.

4
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:19,700
We can only teleport photons,
particles of light,

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,320
and Adam's like caesium in rubidium.
That's it for the present time.

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,150
However,
in the coming years,

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,120
we do expect to be able to teleport
molecules,

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,970
maybe water,
carbon dioxide after that,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,640
who knows,
maybe even Dna,

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,290
maybe organic molecules.
Now,

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,020
to teleport a human raises all the
ethical questions that you mentioned

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,730
because the original,
first of all,

13
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:47,840
it has to be destroyed in the process of
quantum teleportation.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,530
So if you get captain Kirk Zap them
across the room,

15
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,010
you have now seen captain Kirk die.
You've seen this.

16
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:58,790
Adam's fall apart.
But here's this other Captain Clark on

17
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:02,030
the other side of the room who has the
same bad jokes,

18
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,860
who has the same character?

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,950
All the personality quirks as the
original Captain Kirk.

20
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,920
So the imposter says,
no,

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,930
I'm real.
I have the memories,

22
00:01:11,931 --> 00:01:13,550
the personality,
the courts,

23
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,410
uh,
am captain Kirk.

24
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,680
Well,
you just saw the original die and if you

25
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:21,830
believe in a soul,
that soul went to heaven or maybe the

26
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,710
other place,
but that person is dead.

27
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,310
So who is this imposter over there that
the imposter have a soul?

28
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,530
So it raises the question,
are we nothing but information is the

29
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:37,550
soul the essence of who we are?
Nothing but information.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,080
Well,
I'm a physicist.

31
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,430
We don't know the answer to that.
All we're saying is it is physically

32
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:47,950
possible to teleport and entire human
being across the room or maybe onto

33
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:50,990
Mars.
It is physically possible to do that.

34
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,980
And it raises a valid question.
What happened to the soul?

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,280
If you original copy died and somebody
out there has all your memories,

36
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,450
what does that mean?
And the answer is we don't know.
