1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,120
Makers is essentially about the science
of why we like what we like and one of

2
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:14,140
the most interesting answers to that
question is Maya m,

3
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:18,370
a y,
a most advanced yet acceptable,

4
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,090
and this was the theory of everything by
Raymond Loewy,

5
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:24,010
the father of industrial design in
America,

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,380
and a lot of people today don't know who
Raymond Loewy is,

7
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:30,490
but this is a guy who was essentially
kind of like Steve Jobs meets don draper

8
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:34,780
for the 19 fifties.
He invented or designed the first.

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,870
I'll go back.
He designed a the most famous car

10
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,130
designer,
the 20th century,

11
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:42,280
the 1950 studebaker,
the modern train,

12
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:44,590
the modern Greyhound bus,
the modern tractor.

13
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,290
Even that pencil sharpener that looks
like an egg.

14
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:50,260
That was his design,
and in thinking about this question,

15
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:54,910
how could one person understand what
consumers want from things as different

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,500
as cars and pencil sharpeners?
His answer was this Maya,

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,970
most advanced,
yet acceptable.

18
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,970
People are torn between neophilia.
On the one hand they like new things and

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,030
neophobia on the other hand,
they're afraid of anything that's too

20
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:12,370
new and he was this genius.
Essentially.

21
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:17,371
It combining familiarity and surprise.
I think the most useful way to think

22
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:22,501
about the Maya principal is to think of
it as to sell something familiar,

23
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,780
make it surprising,
but you sell something surprising.

24
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,830
Make it familiar,
so let's take an example like star wars.

25
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,290
George Lucas was working on star wars
for a long,

26
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,210
long time.
The script was absolutely terrible.

27
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:37,120
He was sharing it with his best friends
like Francis Ford Coppola,

28
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:40,350
and they were all telling him that the
script was absolute garbage and he had

29
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:45,190
essentially built this incredibly
surprising novel new world filled with

30
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,990
jet eyes and forces and magic and
creatures that no one had seen before.

31
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,670
And then he was reading this book by
Joseph Campbell on the mono myth on this

32
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:58,630
idea that every great story in human
history has essentially been the same

33
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:03,220
story of an ordinary person who goes on
an extraordinary journey.

34
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,610
Defeats a nemesis,
intimately involved in his own origin

35
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:09,580
story,
and then comes back to the real world as

36
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:10,930
the hero.
And so we said,

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,040
oh,
this is it.

38
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,200
This is the story that explains that as
Jesus.

39
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,260
That is Buddha,
that is the odyssey and the Iliad.

40
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,620
I'll take this incredibly familiar
structure and I'll put it into this

41
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:27,580
incredibly surprising world building
exercise and that is star wars.

42
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,530
It essentially sells and incredibly
surprising world in incredibly familiar

43
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:35,620
narrative setting and I think that's one
reason why we like it.

44
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:38,260
It's not so much that it's novel.
Instead,

45
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,610
it's a novel setting that is essentially
telling the oldest story known to man so

46
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,290
it matters where you're starting.
If you're starting with an incredibly

47
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:52,291
familiar product or a really familiar
intellectual property like say movies

48
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:55,930
and creating a movie sequel.
The challenge for those writers is how

49
00:02:55,931 --> 00:03:00,931
do we create a surprising new story that
will get people to a familiar character?

50
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,430
Right?
But lots of people are dealing with the

51
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:06,700
opposite problem.
They have a new idea and they're trying

52
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:09,820
to make it familiar to an audience.
And the best example is from here all

53
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:11,950
come from technology.
I think about,

54
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,020
uh,
the,

55
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:17,350
the first apple macintosh where Steve
jobs famously said,

56
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,210
I need the screen to say hello.
I need it to look like a face.

57
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,920
He's creating an entirely new product
category that people aren't really used

58
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:29,530
to.
And so he understands how critically

59
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:33,970
important it is to take something that
is novel and to sell it through

60
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:37,780
familiarity.
This is a friend you see the exact same

61
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:42,781
thing I think with ai assistance.
Things like Alexa have a lilting female

62
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:45,010
voice,
which you could argue is a sort of

63
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,220
working with a gendered expectation of
an assistant,

64
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,760
but it's still working in the same
principle to sell a really new

65
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:55,390
technology,
like a little nub that has ai

66
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:56,650
intelligence inside of it.

67
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,360
Make it talk just like you would expect
an assistant to talk to you.

68
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,880
I think about this issue also with the
iphone.

69
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:05,260
Most famously,
you know,

70
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,710
Steve Jobs was not creating a product
category,

71
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,610
but he did create the most profitable
product in modern human history.

72
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,260
And it's important to remember that the
iphone did not look new.

73
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,680
It looked like a touch ipod.
It looked exactly like a product that

74
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:25,210
apple already had.
So when people picked it up,

75
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,370
they didn't have to think,
oh,

76
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:29,710
I don't know how to use this.
How does it work?

77
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:35,010
He essentially took an information
ecosystem that they understood and said,

78
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,880
now it also does calls and Internet and
so I think that it's really important

79
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:43,810
when selling a new product,
when taking a new idea and trying to

80
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:47,140
make it appealing,
trying to make it popular to not think

81
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:51,550
about making that surprising idea as
surprising as possible because people

82
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:52,660
love to be surprised.

83
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,690
No,
take the surprising idea and make people

84
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:58,630
feel comfortable with it,
make it feel like home,

85
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,390
make it feel familiar.
And so I think it's also interesting to

86
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:05,830
juxtapose this idea with google glass,
which is Google's sort of famously

87
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:08,860
flopping product where it looked like
spectacles kind of,

88
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:13,000
but they had like a huge cube here.
The point is that I think one of the big

89
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:16,540
problems with Google glass is that it
looked like a prototype.

90
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,730
It looks like a toy for nerds and in
fact I went to x rays and lane wrote a

91
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:24,460
cover story about X.
I've talked to a lot of people who

92
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:28,600
worked on Google glass and they said the
biggest problem with its rollout is that

93
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:33,601
we had a prototype for nerds and we sold
it as a product for consumers and that

94
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:38,140
was a mistake.
We told people that this is the new

95
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:40,330
iphone,
that this is the new product category

96
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:43,750
that's going to redefine the way that we
interact with computers and the

97
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:46,210
Internet,
but that's not really what it was.

98
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,200
It was a nice tool for manufacturing and
construction workers to put something on

99
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:54,250
that looked like goggles and record
their work and send it back to

100
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:57,830
supervisors,
but stop for two seconds and think who

101
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:02,660
wears goggles on a daily basis.
No one people wear glasses,

102
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:04,550
but google glass didn't look like
glasses.

103
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:08,570
They looked like Weirdo goggles and so I
think that it's really important when

104
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:12,110
trying to introduce new product category
to think as clearly as possible.

105
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,910
How do I make this feel as familiar to
its core audience as possible?

106
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,870
Particularly when it's a bright new idea
and I think the Google failed

107
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:23,060
tremendously in that,
in that aspect because they didn't

108
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:26,630
understand properly enough.
The habits and the familiarities of the

109
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:28,190
people that they were ultimately selling
to.
