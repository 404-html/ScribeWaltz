1
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,920
The word theory can be used to mean
something speculative and tentative in

2
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:15,410
everyday speech.
It probably usually is used in that

3
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:17,990
sense,
so I'll just very often use it in a much

4
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:21,110
more positive sense.
I think the easiest ways to use the

5
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:25,250
ordinary language word fact in the
ordinary language sense of the word fact

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,280
evolution is a fact.
The evidence that makes it a fat is

7
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:33,000
partly fossil evidence,
uh,

8
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:38,290
partly competitive comparative evidence,
looking at modern species and comparing

9
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,650
their bones,
their organs,

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,620
their structures generally and
especially their molecules that genes at

11
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:48,920
a molecular level.
This is extremely persuasive and

12
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:52,010
powerful evidence.
You compare the,

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,660
the genes of animals and plants.
You find that they,

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,900
the pattern of resemblance is a tree of
branching tree,

15
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,260
and that branching tree could only be a
family tree.

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,700
Other very persuasive evidence is there.
The geographical distribution of animals

17
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:13,790
and plants on islands and continents.
They are exactly where we should expect

18
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,340
them to be.
If evolution were a factor.
