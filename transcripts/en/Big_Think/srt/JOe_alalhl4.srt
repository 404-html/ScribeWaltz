1
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,610
I mean,
I frankly do feel that the,

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,070
uh,
the Europeans have a much more mature

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,993
overall

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,120
outlook on,
uh,

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,970
on this issue.
Um,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,840
most people that I know anyway,
who were brought up in Europe,

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,060
uh,
were brought up with a little bit of

8
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:30,930
water blended with wine when they were
in their teens finally with a little bit

9
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,390
of wine at the dinner table,
you know,

10
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:36,480
when they were in their late teens and
by the time they hit 18,

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,070
it's not a big deal anymore.
And it's really in countries that,

12
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,880
uh,
that don't have as mature and outlook on

13
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:48,450
the issue that tend to have problems
with binge drinking,

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,910
et cetera.
I mean,

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,180
there can be,
I can see good arguments on either side,

16
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:56,400
but I mean,
I was responsible.

17
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:58,590
I,
I went through this weird period where I

18
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:03,330
was 18 and I was legal and then I became
illegal when they changed the,

19
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,240
uh,
when they changed it to 21.

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
And then I went back to being legal
again.

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,700
Like,
you know,

22
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,270
two years later I was in this weird kind
of a limbo thing.

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,051
And,
you know,

24
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:15,930
I think that I was responsible when I
was younger,

25
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,700
um,
you know,

26
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:18,780
you're going to,
uh,

27
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,381
I mean,
I,

28
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:21,030
I don't want to bring up to sort of,
you know,

29
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:22,410
all the classic,
uh,

30
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,131
you know,
well,

31
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:25,500
if you can go and fight in a war and you
can't have a beer,

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,440
all those things,
it's a complicated issue.

33
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,620
But I just do think that rather than
looking at it from a historical point of

34
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:37,140
view,
which I think is often the case that

35
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:41,490
people take a calmer longview
recognizing that,

36
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:43,350
uh,
that the enjoyment of alcoholic

37
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:46,120
beverages is a part of,
you know,

38
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,090
human humanity.
That's,

39
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,270
that's,
that's part of what we're,

40
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,190
we're all about buying large as human
beings.

41
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:53,920
I mean,
we've,

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,870
uh,
people believe that we went from a

43
00:01:55,871 --> 00:02:00,180
hunter gatherer existence to a settled
agricultural existence in order to have

44
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:01,500
enough grain to make beer.

45
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,530
You know,
it is central to the human experience

46
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,820
and you know,
I think it's a,

47
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,831
you know,
and it,

48
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:10,440
and it's healthy for you.
I mean in moderation.

49
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,840
And it's better for you than not having
it.

50
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,160
So if,
you know,

51
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,920
if you really want to bring people up
properly,

52
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,590
you know,
teach them how to eat properly and teach

53
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:21,410
them how to drink properly.
You know,

54
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:22,410
I mean,
if you wanna,

55
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,410
if you want to ban something that's
going to,

56
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,170
you know,
uh,

57
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,720
caused a lot of problems,
you could say,

58
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:28,950
well,
let's band butter,

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,360
you know,
or let's ban.

60
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:33,330
I mean,
if you wanted to look at the overall

61
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:35,390
cost of the population,
but better

62
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,010
I teach people how to cook,
how to eat and how to live well.

63
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,970
Oh No,
there are alcoholics and you weren't

64
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,203
quite sure,

65
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,460
you know,
I mean unfortunately,

66
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:54,060
I mean alcoholism is a disease.
It is a problem,

67
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,460
uh,
just as overeating as a disease.

68
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,150
Um,
I mean beer essentially is food and

69
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,850
people are going to,
uh,

70
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,960
are going to abuse all sorts of foods in
different ways and whether this involves

71
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:10,864
your,
you know,

72
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,720
eating this and that and,
and growing to be,

73
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,970
you know,
a 400 lbs and,

74
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:18,490
and not being functional or,
you know,

75
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:20,050
it's a,
an alcohol problem.

76
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:24,670
All of these things are going to be
problems across the board and society.

77
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,880
I think you can take a more mature
outlook on it as a society and not look

78
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:33,970
at it as whether,
again,

79
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:34,421
it's,
you know,

80
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:36,880
it's,
it's eating or it's a alcohol.

81
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:42,270
Is it a moral problem or you know,
is it really teaching people how to

82
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:47,671
handle themselves in a world that my
hands everything to you on a platter and

83
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:48,730
says,
well,

84
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,520
here it is for you to consume.
And I think that,

85
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:52,400
uh,
you know,

86
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,730
um,
the Europeans have a better outlook on

87
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:56,010
it,
but there are by no means perfect.

88
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,250
Yeah,

89
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,910
well,
I can't say that I can answer a question

90
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,260
like that,
uh,

91
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,600
so quickly,
but I'm reminded of a,

92
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,420
of a,
uh,

93
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,330
Francois Mitterrand last meal,
which I think lasted about two days,

94
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,060
you know,
and had sort of every little,

95
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,300
you know,
order lawns and,

96
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,100
and whatever else,
and all of his friends around him.

97
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,360
Uh,
uh,

98
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:23,120
and the,
the,

99
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,980
the,
the greatest,

100
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:25,600
uh,
the greatest risks that you can be

101
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:26,171
broad.
I mean,

102
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:28,400
I've had,
I've had beers as old as 18,

103
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,120
69,
which are unbelievable.

104
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,831
You know,
I,

105
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:35,010
I would be gathering up things for,
for years,

106
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,990
for,
for,

107
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,540
for such an occasion,
so,

108
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,130
um,
and like me to,

109
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,540
I would,
I would make it that meal last for like

110
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,970
two or three days and say,
okay,

111
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:47,270
then that's that.
So it's not a question I get a,

112
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,060
I can answer quickly,
but I can,

113
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:51,010
I can assure you that it would be
awfully good.
