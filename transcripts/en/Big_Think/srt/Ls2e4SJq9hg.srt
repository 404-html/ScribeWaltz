1
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,310
We usually have the application on the
website for about two months and we go

2
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:16,050
out and do presentations at different
schools.

3
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:19,530
And sometimes that can be one
presentation and the entire school comes

4
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:23,910
as an assembly or you go from class to
class or it changes based on what

5
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:26,100
school.
But we do presentations and you know,

6
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:28,980
encourage cause the sign up.
And then about a month or so before the

7
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:31,350
trip,
we go through the selection process and

8
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:34,110
we picked the groups.
And then from then we make sure that we

9
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:37,800
have two meetings with students and
parents and then two meetings with just

10
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:38,910
students.
Um,

11
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:41,160
so that they get to know each other a
little bit before we go.

12
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:43,650
And we get to give them the history of
our organization and what we've done,

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,460
kind of what we're getting into.
And then we fly down as a group.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,120
And in New Orleans we actually own a bus
and we just bought a second bus,

15
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:52,080
which was really exciting.

16
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,710
And,
um,

17
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,690
so when we're there,
we drive around in our buses.

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,853
But,
uh,

19
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,020
you know,
the first day is mostly just flying and

20
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:00,000
settling in,
but they,

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,240
the first full day we go on the levy
tour and like we start with an

22
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:06,420
orientation about the history of Nyt,
know who we've worked with,

23
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,250
um,
how we've gotten to where we're at.

24
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,840
And then we go out on the tour and
actually see the different levies and

25
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:14,250
see the different neighborhoods.
And,

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,610
uh,
we give everyone an opportunity to kind

27
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,310
of see with their own eyes and
understand what it is that they're

28
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:23,530
getting themselves into and the
neighborhoods that they'll be doing work

29
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:24,630
in.
And,

30
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:27,210
um,
that's a big day.

31
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:29,040
I mean,
there's no physical work really on that

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,900
day,
but it's the roughest day for everyone

33
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:35,901
because it's so emotionally and mentally
draining because most people have never

34
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:39,510
heard anything like this before or seen
anything like this before.

35
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,120
So that's usually how that day goes.
Um,

36
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,280
and every night we have a debrief and
basically the way that that works is we

37
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:50,340
bring everybody together and we sit in a
circle and we run by consensus.

38
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,310
And so what we do is we sit in a circle
and we have,

39
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,350
uh,
we have around and so every week

40
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,100
everybody has about one minute to speak
about their day and their feelings of

41
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:01,050
the day or any thoughts.
And once we've gotten around the whole

42
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:03,600
circle,
then we go into what we call crosstalk.

43
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,870
And then anybody can just kind of
interject and say whatever they want.

44
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:08,520
And I've realized that,
uh,

45
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,630
over time that the,
the round is really just kind of like a

46
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:16,200
warmup for the cross talk because when
people have the freedom to like really

47
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:18,630
say what they want to say without so
much time constraints,

48
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,120
it all breaks loose.

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,500
And you never know what's really going
to come up.

50
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:24,030
But that's where the real learning
happens.

51
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,223
And,
uh,

52
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,120
you know,
the first debrief that's of the levy

53
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:30,030
tour are usually that just are mind
blowing.

54
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:31,770
And then each day following that,
they,

55
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,140
they are as well there.
But they're different every day.

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,020
And I guess starting on the second day,
um,

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,620
we now work with a bunch of different
organizations and in the morning our

58
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:43,860
students do physical work,
whether it's gutting a house,

59
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,140
rebuilding a house,
uh,

60
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,670
cutting down grass and yards.
And now I'm big projects that we work on

61
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,000
our building community gardens.
And so we do that in the morning and

62
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:56,940
then in the afternoon we go canvasing.
And that's,

63
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,950
you know,
just knocking on people's doors and

64
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,330
speaking to residents.
And that's really the most important

65
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:05,620
part of the trip because it gives our
students a chance to speak to the people

66
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:08,830
who are actually here for Katrina and
who really lived through this and who

67
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:10,330
are dealing with these issues day to
day.

68
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,550
And they hear it from them and not from
us,

69
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:14,170
not from the media,
not from the government,

70
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:16,570
like directly from the people.
And you know,

71
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,470
we break people into pairs and they go
and it,

72
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:20,710
and it's really great on a number of
different levels.

73
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:24,820
One,
it's a primary source for our students

74
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:27,220
to really get information,
um,

75
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,100
to,
it means a lot to the residents because

76
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:31,480
really the,
in the ninth ward,

77
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,480
there's really only one house on a block
in certain areas,

78
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,370
you know,
some places are more populated than

79
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:37,121
others,
but you know,

80
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:38,800
a lot of it's,
it's still pretty desolate.

81
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:42,910
So to see for them to see volunteers
from New York come down just to hear

82
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:44,440
what they have to say.
And you know,

83
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,840
it's not about like filling out a flyer
or,

84
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,750
or,
or doing a survey or anything.

85
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,570
It's really just to hear what they have
to say and,

86
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:52,540
and stuff like that.

87
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,730
So it means a lot to them.
But for us,

88
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,740
for our students,
it's great because,

89
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,491
uh,
you know,

90
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:59,560
they get a connection with a real person
down there.

91
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:01,930
And also the,
the two people that we pair up generally

92
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,550
probably won't have known each other
yet.

93
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,620
Um,
especially earlier on in the week.

94
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:09,370
And so just the experience that these
two students have walking down the

95
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:12,520
streets of New Orleans together and
knocking on homes and meeting these

96
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,320
amazing people.
I mean,

97
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,570
it bonds them forever and you know,
everybody,

98
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:21,571
like two people who would have never
ever second given each other a second

99
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,210
look ever before.
It could be best friends by the end of

100
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:26,044
that one day.

101
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,280
Well,
I guess the most,

102
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,340
the most dangerous work that we have is
also the most fun work.

103
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:35,710
It's gutting homes.
And we've been doing that since the very

104
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,790
first trip.
There are less homes,

105
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,980
the gut now than there used to be.
Um,

106
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,761
but we still,
I mean,

107
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:42,370
we just did one this February.
We're probably going to do some in April

108
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:43,360
and I mean,
would,

109
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:46,990
that means it's basically stripping a
house down to the bare bones and the

110
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:50,380
bear foundation of a house because the
homes that were lucky enough to stay

111
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:53,530
standing in New Orleans,
especially in the Ninth Ward,

112
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,540
still had 20 feet of water for about a
week.

113
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,460
So everything on the inside was
destroyed.

114
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:59,620
So we have to go in and we have to knock
down the walls,

115
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,290
uh,
take out the furniture,

116
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,900
the sinks,
electrical,

117
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:07,480
everything,
and just strip it down so that it can

118
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:08,314
then be rebuilt.

119
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,800
And usually everybody loves to do it
cause they get to use sledge hammers or

120
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:13,390
you know,
take their anger out on a wall or

121
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:14,260
something like that.
And you know,

122
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:16,300
people love to do that.
Um,

123
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,220
but it's,
it's pretty safe.

124
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:21,190
I mean,
one person in our three years has

125
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:24,880
stepped on a nail and it was our teacher
who told us to get tetanus shots and he

126
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:26,050
didn't.
So that's his fault,

127
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,330
but he was fine.
Um,

128
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,261
and,
uh,

129
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:30,730
so we've never really had a problem with
that.

130
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:31,960
And otherwise,
I guess,

131
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,150
you know,
with rebuilding homes,

132
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,030
we're always with professionals,
like people who know exactly what

133
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:37,960
they're doing,
who can handle,

134
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,250
who really handled the heavy machinery.
But we have worked on dry walling and

135
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:44,110
sanding and,
um,

136
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,610
mudding and painting and all,
all that type of stuff.

137
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,760
Another big part of the physical work is
mowing lawns.

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,090
And a lot of people at first are really
just not excited to do it because it's

139
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,980
mowing lawns.
You can do that anywhere,

140
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:03,020
I guess.
But what's the reason why it's so

141
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:04,330
important is because,
uh,

142
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,890
the city of New Orleans created this law
called the good neighbor law.

143
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,240
And it says that at this point,
if anyone's grasp reaches above 18

144
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:14,480
inches there,
then fined $500 a day by the city.

145
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,220
Um,
and so,

146
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,620
but,
but there's still about 200,000

147
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:21,680
residents of New Orleans who are,
who haven't been able to come home that

148
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:25,790
has spread out in all 50 states of the
United States in you have 6,000 of them

149
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,940
still in New York City right now.
There are thousands in Texas.

150
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:30,230
There's some,
even in Alaska,

151
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:31,970
I mean,
talk about culture shock being taken

152
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:33,740
from New Orleans and being relocated
there.

153
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:34,640
But,
um,

154
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,190
you know,
there's still everywhere but in their

155
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:40,580
homes and the government is still
mandating that they come home once a

156
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:42,350
week to mow their lawns and if they
don't,

157
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,970
they're going to find them,
uh,

158
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,730
um,
money that they can't afford.

159
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,090
So,
you know,

160
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:49,910
our job is really to go in there and,
uh,

161
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,460
mow their lawn so that these people
don't have to pay their fines.

162
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,600
Usually we go and mow the lawns of
people who we are in contact with,

163
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,380
whether they're in New Orleans or people
that we know that have,

164
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,370
that are still displaced.
But if we like run out of the list,

165
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:07,190
which doesn't happen very often,
but sometimes then we'll just go and

166
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:09,020
drive.
And if we see a lot that needs to be

167
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:11,810
cleared,
we clear it because we know somebody

168
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:15,110
somewhere is paying.
Some is paying $500 a day for that.

169
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,990
So I'm not,
even if we don't know the person

170
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:19,160
personally,
like we want to,

171
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,300
we know it's helping someone.
So that's another piece of the physical

172
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:24,440
work.
And then,

173
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,690
uh,
working on community gardens is,

174
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,990
is a newer project.
We,

175
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,100
we've just started to do that this year.
But um,

176
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,690
it's so important.
I mean,

177
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:34,010
it's,
it's one of the most important things

178
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,590
that we're doing because in,
in the lower ninth ward itself,

179
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:40,160
there's only one grocery store and it's
much more like a Bodega and they pretty

180
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:44,780
much just sell alcohol anyway.
And so the people either are resorted to

181
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:48,750
go there and buy really unhealthy food,
um,

182
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,400
or travel 20 miles outside of the city,
outside of the ninth ward to go to a

183
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:58,220
bigger grocery store,
which a lot of people can't afford to

184
00:07:58,221 --> 00:07:59,270
do,
uh,

185
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,270
all the time.
So what is so important about these

186
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:07,271
community gardens is that it's creating
sources of food and healthy food,

187
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:10,940
fruits and vegetables for residents to,
um,

188
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,060
to eat within an,
and it's being grown within their own

189
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:14,480
community.

190
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,540
And it's also providing jobs for members
of the community who otherwise don't

191
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,670
have any,
uh,

192
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,200
because they can work on it.
And one major thing is that we're

193
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,540
working with,
we helped start there.

194
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,350
There also is an,
uh,

195
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,620
a high school in the whole lower ninth
ward anymore.

196
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:29,630
There were two and the government
actually,

197
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,700
uh,
tore both of them down,

198
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,120
one of which in the middle of our us
being in there,

199
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,993
uh,
gutting it.

200
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,700
Uh,
we had a group there and they forced the

201
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:40,310
entire group out and they knocked it
down right in front of us.

202
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:44,540
This was two years ago and it running
right now there's nothing in its place.

203
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,610
It's just grass.
They haven't done anything with the

204
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:47,990
land.
So it didn't really make sense to me.

205
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:50,300
But either way they tore both of the
buildings down.

206
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:54,560
So one of our projects has been,
we've helped start now the only high

207
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:55,230
school there.

208
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,510
It's really a technically a homeschool
but it's,

209
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:02,340
it's all that the people have right now.
And I'm one of our teachers who taught

210
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,800
at our school,
came down with us this past summer and

211
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:08,280
just kind of decided not to come home
and he stayed there and he helped start

212
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,680
the school and he's getting more and
more students every week.

213
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,520
And uh,
he has actually gotten the rights to the

214
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:18,060
land surrounding the school and we're
turning those into community gardens.

215
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:21,090
And right now we fund finance the school
based on our fundraisers.

216
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,850
But the goal is once they are really
growing fruits and vegetables,

217
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:25,980
the students will learn how to garden
and how to farm,

218
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,590
which is great for them,
for them to just know.

219
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,640
But also they can then sell those fruits
and vegetables and that money is what's

220
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:33,300
going to finance this.
