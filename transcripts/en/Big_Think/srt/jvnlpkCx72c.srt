1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,160
I guess my personal philosophy
almost always has to do with,

2
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:21,770
with,
in the most important way with the need

3
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:26,771
that I feel everyone has for an artistic
element in their lives and it doesn't

4
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:31,450
matter what their profession or their
that um,

5
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,390
I think that I heard once that everyone,
everyone in the world has written a

6
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:39,680
poem.
I don't know whether that's true,

7
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,080
but it should be true.
It must,

8
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:44,210
something like,
it must be true because I don't think

9
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:49,211
anyone lacks what we would call an
artistic impulse and what I feel more

10
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,650
than sort of political causes that I
might be interested in.

11
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,030
I think the,
the cause that I would embrace is the

12
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:04,031
idea that people might be encouraged to
experience even for a few moments in a

13
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:10,250
day.
The idea that,

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,470
uh,
that the imagination is ruling their,

15
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,700
their life for a moment.
Um,

16
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,780
and um,
that would be my prime cause in spite of

17
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:21,700
the fact that,
you know,

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,640
I have occasionally I have written
pieces with very frankly political

19
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:28,010
subjects and I've spent moments in my
life,

20
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:29,720
you know,
19,

21
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:30,380
64.

22
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,580
I went with all of the freedom summer
folks to Mississippi and with a group

23
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:35,630
from,
from here,

24
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:39,740
and we,
we definitely experienced an amazing

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,800
moment in the politics of this country,
but when I've addressed things like that

26
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,770
in my music,
it's been much more because it's part of

27
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,700
a whole emotional complex for myself
then that I want to convert we're or

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,600
influence opinion because unfortunately
the audience for such a piece usually

29
00:02:05,361 --> 00:02:08,150
agrees
and I think,

30
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:10,940
you know,
if one were really to be serious about

31
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,240
the prison,
about moving people through the arts

32
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,150
politically,
you'd have to almost find a,

33
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,200
select your way into an audience that
doesn't like what you're saying,

34
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,400
what you're saying.
And very seldom of course,

35
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:24,234
do we ever do that?

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,340
It does.
It's probably the hardest thing for me

37
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:34,341
to articulate because most of my life as
a performer deals with forms of

38
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:36,850
religious music.
Um,

39
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,380
and I certainly feel that when I conduct
a Bach Cantata that I am a absolutely

40
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,660
engaged by,
not in an abstract way at all by the

41
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:54,840
issues and by the stories and the
experience.

42
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,320
Um,
but I can't,

43
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,300
I can't find a formal structure for
that.

44
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,370
And um,
when I write a religious text,

45
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:14,371
I would have to say that I am as gripped
by the ancient and the sound of the

46
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:22,200
words and the feeling that they are
carrying significance,

47
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,790
a almost that has been a sort of
gradually attached to them.

48
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,630
I'm over centuries.
Um,

49
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,320
I would like to feel that,
that all of the assertions were things I

50
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:42,400
can assert and that's not really how I
feel.

51
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,610
But the King James Bible,
I've come back to so often for texts and

52
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,030
it,
it was really translated at a moment

53
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:56,410
where the English language,
he had an extraordinary rhythmic and

54
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,430
verbal variety.

55
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,410
It's Shakespeare's era and I find
sometimes the passage,

56
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:06,880
this passage that attracts me has
unusual words or rhythms that I just

57
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:09,780
find absolutely irresistible.
Um,

58
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,340
in addition to,
of course it's,

59
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,430
it's accumulated significance,
but it's as much just a,

60
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,920
a deep affection for a text,
a love for a text as it is the whole

61
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,370
world of doctrine from which it merges.
And of course,

62
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,030
like a lot of people who are dealing
with church music.

63
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:36,220
And actually work as a church musician
some of the time,

64
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,420
it's terribly unsettling to have to
contemplate how much of the conflict in

65
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:49,930
the world to this day is generated by
religious groups,

66
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,450
by people who are fired up about the
doctrine.

67
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,890
And it's difficult for someone like
myself to embrace the institutional

68
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:06,340
issues having from a semi historian's
point of view,

69
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:11,230
a pretty firm idea that they often lead
to people fighting each other about it.

70
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,620
The hardest things,
you know,

71
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,680
compassion and forgiveness and a
tolerance,

72
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:29,580
which is also a really a hard one
because,

73
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:30,750
you know,
some of those,

74
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,300
some of the major issues in this
country,

75
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,500
you know,
race.

76
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,030
And,
um,

77
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,290
I'd have to even say a kind of
intellectual tolerance.

78
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:46,140
I'm very bothered that,
um,

79
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,150
many groups in this country are
dismissive of other groups because they

80
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,640
feel they're not as cultured,
not as educated.

81
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,510
I think we have a
very tremendous attraction to

82
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:05,171
intolerance almost bred into the early
life of this country.

83
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,073
And,
um,

84
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,540
so yeah,
I would consider those,

85
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,330
my
major virtues.

86
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,350
And also it's,
you know,

87
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:17,351
it's so hard
to apologize for things and I'm always

88
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:21,610
impressed by people who,
uh,

89
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,690
when they've done something really
wrong,

90
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,210
don't do the standard thing,
which is to make it worse and

91
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,640
ostracized,
but actually go the whole way and try to

92
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,290
reengage the situation.
Um,

93
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,830
and in our profession,
our music profession,

94
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,170
there are constant tests of those,
uh,

95
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,540
of those issues.
