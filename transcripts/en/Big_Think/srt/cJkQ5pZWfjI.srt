1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,960
Yeah.

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,480
Oh,
what did I haven't read any papers for

3
00:00:11,481 --> 00:00:12,314
at least a month.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:15,933
Yeah.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,270
Oh,
that's at once.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,490
Two things.
One of the dumbest moves I've ever heard

7
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:28,491
of being made by a network.
And also it's what I knew what I first

8
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,690
heard about it when back when they were
telling Jay,

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,610
although your ratings are great,
we don't need you to forever so you

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,700
know,
a wonderful way to treat the psyche of

11
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:44,190
the performer,
which is one thing that we're people

12
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:45,120
never have a clue about.

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,523
Um,

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,320
and I knew when I first heard it,
this is never going to work.

15
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,720
I don't know how exactly.
I don't pretend to know who I.

16
00:00:55,721 --> 00:01:00,280
10:00 proved to be such an awful time
for a talk show,

17
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:06,330
but it is the psychology of that much
later when the show's on and people have

18
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:10,840
had a drink or two and are about to go
to bed and want some entertainment

19
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:15,841
before nodding off is very different
from how you feel at 10:00 when you

20
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:20,520
could see law and order another such
shows and,

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,580
and it just a natural institute over to
the mess Jay inherited.

22
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,760
And that Conan was,
Wa interestingly pointed out that,

23
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,560
that,
uh,

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,460
that,
that hijack offer,

25
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:43,461
they offered him that cynical thing that
no one in his right mind would accept to

26
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:45,114
get rid of him.

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,473
Um,

28
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,940
when you said that you can have the
tonight show at 12.

29
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:50,774
Oh,
five.

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,270
Well,
somebody including code and pointed out

31
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:53,751
that 12,
oh,

32
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:56,180
five is no longer tonight.
It's tomorrow.

33
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,000
So it would have to be called the early,
early show,

34
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:02,290
but anything but the tonight show,
any managed,

35
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:07,291
I think to damage to make somewhat
damaged goods of both artists involved.

36
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,710
And they also succeeded in making their
enemy,

37
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:17,711
David Letterman and vcs competition more
successful in evart.

38
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,090
So whoever is responsible for this
boneheaded move,

39
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,420
we'll,
as we know from watching these things,

40
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,550
certainly within a week or to be
promoted and given a big raise.
