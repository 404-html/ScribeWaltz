1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,313
Okay.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,960
I really see twitter and facebook to a
slightly lesser extent,

3
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:12,920
but really twitter as,
um,

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,030
routing devices for human attention.
Um,

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,330
they're very good at that.
They're effectively providing our

6
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:24,331
species with a common nervous system,
which we can use to transmit signals to

7
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:26,830
each other.
And so when there's something that,

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,250
uh,
is a very provocative or disturbing

9
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:32,910
signal or a beautiful signal,
it's,

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,430
it's a great system to get a lot of
humans attention directed at that thing

11
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:37,300
very,
very quickly.

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,950
And that can actually happen in a matter
of moments.

13
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:41,380
Now our minutes.
So as routing devices,

14
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:43,420
twitter and facebook are,
are incredibly effective.

15
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:46,810
And I think they do that very elegantly.
I think it's self expressive mediums.

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,810
They're less elegant and I actually
don't think they're designed to be self

17
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:54,220
expressive mediums in the same way that
a blank piece of paper and a pen is

18
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,870
designed to be a self expressive medium.

19
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,880
And so when I think about,
uh,

20
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,060
like cowbird and how it relates to
services like twitter and facebook,

21
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,540
I really see twitter and facebook is
routing devices that can route attention

22
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:09,040
to experiences and cowbird stories more
as the experiences themselves.

23
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,230
I had noticed a few trends happening in
online culture in general but also just

24
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:16,810
in culture more generally over the last
few years.

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,170
And um,
there were really four that sort of

26
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:22,060
struck me that as things that I wanted
to,

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,850
to transform it to reverse a little bit.
Um,

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,030
the first one is compression.
Um,

29
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,090
one thing we've seen actually predating
the web but accentuated with the web is

30
00:01:33,131 --> 00:01:36,940
the compressing and shortening and
speeding up of communication.

31
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:38,620
So you can go back to like letter
writing,

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,190
which gave way to a eventually telephone
calls,

33
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:45,130
which then gateway to faxes,
which then gave way to emails,

34
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:46,560
which then gave way to,
uh,

35
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,550
text messages and chats and tweets.

36
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,750
And each successive level gets like more
and more compressed and shorter and

37
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:55,660
faster.
And we're sort of like hovering at the

38
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:58,540
tweet right now.
And it was unclear to me that there's

39
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:01,930
another level of compression after that.
There may be as one more like maybe we

40
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:03,520
start grunting at each other or
something,

41
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:04,200
but,
uh,

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,730
we've pretty much hit a kind of terminal
velocity,

43
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:07,570
I think,
uh,

44
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,640
in terms of how fast communication can
go.

45
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,220
So then you ask the question like,
what happens after that?

46
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,240
And,
uh,

47
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,270
do we continue to do that mode or do we
hit some kind of wall and bounce back in

48
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:20,560
the other direction?
I'm craving a little more depth and

49
00:02:20,561 --> 00:02:23,410
substance again.
And so I was betting on that happening

50
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:25,060
and wanting to help that happen.
So,

51
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,310
um,
so this first trend of compression,

52
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,810
um,
I was,

53
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:30,700
uh,
I was interested in transforming into a

54
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:32,920
kind of deepening a,
not necessarily a lengthening,

55
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:36,010
because I think that our brain chemistry
is actually different now.

56
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,180
And you cannot expect a large portion of
the planet to sit down and read a 500

57
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:44,080
page novel anymore or even go to watch
an opera for three hours anymore.

58
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,750
Some people will do that,
but those are not the mediums that are

59
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:48,670
going to resonate most broadly with,
uh,

60
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,940
the human species right now.
And I think you have to understand the

61
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:55,600
time you're living in and what are the
most resonant mediums of that time.

62
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,350
And then designed to those.
Related to that was the second trend had

63
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:02,530
noticed,
which was a kind of a disposability like

64
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:07,360
a lot of the stuff that we put out there
into the world as individuals,

65
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,900
we have this sort of complicit
understanding that it's going to be

66
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:15,901
swollen up and replaced moments after we
publish it by the torrent of new stuff

67
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:17,920
that comes after it.
There's this sense of just,

68
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:18,963
uh,
uh,

69
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,090
expressing yourself in a kind of
disposable way that,

70
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,160
um,
won't have any sort of lasting impact.

71
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,480
This was very different from something I
had experienced when I was younger,

72
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,120
when I was a lot younger.
And when I was working more with

73
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:33,760
physical art,
I used to keep these incredibly

74
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:37,960
meticulous sketchbooks filled with
plants and ticket stubs and um,

75
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,490
dead insects and watercolor paintings
and writings and all of this stuff.

76
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:45,820
They were like this sort of living
testimony of my life every day.

77
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,940
And they were incredibly time consuming
to make,

78
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,240
but each time you added a page,
it got more and more beautiful.

79
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:53,980
The overall thing got more and more
beautiful.

80
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:58,180
And over the course of years you just
have these incredibly meaningful objects

81
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:01,120
that are kind of a mirror of your,
of your lived experience.

82
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,790
And so that kind of timelessness,
um,

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
that slowly building something over
time,

84
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:08,860
which becomes more and more beautiful
over time.

85
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,960
I had never had that feeling on the
Internet,

86
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,360
like everything on the Internet was
always about the moment,

87
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,110
but not even in the kind of like new
agey Buddhist sense of being very

88
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,780
present,
but just more in terms of novelty,

89
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,070
like what's new,
what's the latest,

90
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:21,700
what's the latest?

91
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,610
And um,
and so I was interested in taking that,

92
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,370
uh,
that sort of disposability and trying to

93
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:29,440
transform it and do a and do a
timelessness.

94
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,800
The third major trend I noticed was a
curation.

95
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,890
So people were increasingly expressing
themselves through the stuff that they

96
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:40,430
thought was cool.
Um,

97
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,630
so there are web services like pinterest
and Tumblr.

98
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:45,310
And twitter and facebook,
which have,

99
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,950
um,
really encouraged this type of self

100
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:51,040
expression in our culture.
It's a lot easier than creating things

101
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:55,180
directly to assemble lists is easier
than to come up with original stuff.

102
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:57,450
And so I noticed that a lot of,
um,

103
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,190
self expression online was taking the
form of curation.

104
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,250
It's kind of like walking into someone's
apartment and like judging them by what

105
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,840
they have hanging on their walls,
uh,

106
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,750
and sort of talking to them.
So I was interested in taking this

107
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:11,140
curation and turning it into like a
create just creation again.

108
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,660
Um,
and then the fourth trend I noticed was,

109
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,940
uh,
this kind of self promotion.

110
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,140
It's like life as an advertisement.
This is something I think we all feel to

111
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:24,310
different degrees when we fill out our
facebook profiles and when we develop

112
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:28,630
these online personas for ourselves,
there's this way that we try to

113
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:31,570
advertise ourselves and look as awesome
as we possibly can.

114
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:32,980
Like,
look how hot my girlfriend is,

115
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:35,740
look how wild my party was,
look how fun my vacation was,

116
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:38,440
all of these things.
But I think that creates a lot of

117
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,220
unhealthy tendencies in people because
you start comparing yourselves to

118
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:43,054
others.
Uh,

119
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,870
you're always looking for ways to look
cooler than you are leads to insecurity

120
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:50,260
and anxiety.
So I was interested in taking that self

121
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,370
promotion and turning it into more of a
contemplative self reflection.

122
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,760
Okay.
