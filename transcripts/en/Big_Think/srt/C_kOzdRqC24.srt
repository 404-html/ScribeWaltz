1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,080
Yeah,

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,450
what I be sleep,
try to do this,

3
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:17,420
understand human nature,
how the mind works,

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,100
what makes us tick,
what are the patterns of thought and

5
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:26,360
emotion and motivation that characterize
our species.

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,230
I focus on language partly because you
can't make a living out of studying

7
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:35,150
human nature.
It's just too big a topic.

8
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:37,910
You've got to pick something tractable
to study.

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,230
For me it is has been language in a deed
for much of my career,

10
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,150
one little corner of language,
namely a regular and irregular verbs and

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,640
I have my reasons for focusing on that
particular corner.

12
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:53,180
I think it does shed light on larger
questions about what makes the,

13
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,830
the mind work.
Uh,

14
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,110
but language is a general topic is a,
I think a good entree into human nature

15
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:03,890
for a number of reasons.
It's distinctively human if you're

16
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:06,350
interested in general in what makes
humans,

17
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,390
unlike a mice and birds language is a
pretty good place to start.

18
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,470
Not only because of language itself,
the fact that we make noise with our

19
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:20,471
mouths in order to get ideas across,
but because language has to be fine

20
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:25,310
tuned for the kind of thoughts and the
kind of social relationships that humans

21
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:28,340
want to share and negotiate with one
another.

22
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,890
So it's a,
it's a window into human nature.

23
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,040
It's also figured in debates on human
nature,

24
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,120
perhaps most famously with Chomsky in
the late fifties,

25
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,480
using language as a way to rehabilitate
the idea of innate mental structure.

26
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,450
Something that was virtually taboo in
the 19 fifties.

27
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,310
He said language is a very good
candidate for something that is innately

28
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:57,311
and uniquely human.
So it's an opening wedge for the idea

29
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,610
that,
uh,

30
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:01,310
that important parts of the mind are
innately structured.

31
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,790
It's also a,
a prime case of mental computation.

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,280
It's very hard to make sense of language
of our ability to string words into new

33
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:16,880
combinations.
Sentences that other people have never

34
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:19,910
heard before,
but can very quickly understand for the

35
00:02:19,911 --> 00:02:23,290
first time without appealing to the idea
that we have a,

36
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,800
a mental algorithm,
a set of rules or a recipe or a formula

37
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,100
that picks words out of a memory store
and strings them together in

38
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,820
combinations where the order as well as
the choice of words is meaningful.

39
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,090
So language sheds light on the idea that
the mind is a computational system.

40
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,390
I did what I think is the,
isn't for a long time will be the most

41
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,110
exhaustive study of one aspect of child
language development.

42
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,070
The fact that kids make errors like,
uh,

43
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,273
I,
uh,

44
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,050
oh,
we holding the baby rabbits,

45
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,300
the alligator gold kerplunk where they
add a regular suffolk's like ed to an

46
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:09,340
irregular verb,
like a hold or here,

47
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:13,300
or stick producing errors like stick to
tared and hold,

48
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,890
uh,
I analyzed 20,000 of those forms from

49
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,330
computer transcripts of children
developing language and developed a

50
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,570
theory of why kids make that error,
uh,

51
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,420
how they outgrow it and what it shows
about language.

52
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,720
The reason to obsess over a tiny little
topic like that is that it's a nice

53
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:39,331
illustration of children's creativity in
acquiring language that the essence of

54
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:45,031
language is that you aren't restricted
to a fixed list of messages that you've

55
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:48,130
memorized and that you then regurgitate
like a parrot.

56
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,540
Rather you're,
you recreate me combined elements to

57
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,470
create new messages.
Every sentence that we utter is a brand

58
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:59,890
new sentence,
but it's rather hard to study the

59
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:03,460
process of,
of kids making up new sentences when a

60
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:07,000
kid says something like strict or tiered
or hear it or hold it.

61
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,450
That's a tiny example of recombination
that I think is the engine that powers

62
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:16,810
language as a whole.
The,

63
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,400
uh,
the,

64
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:23,401
the act of children making an error like
that I think is a way of catching them

65
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:27,040
in the act of doing something that makes
language powerful.

66
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,570
Namely combining things by rules.
And in trying to understand that one

67
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,980
phenomenon,
I hope that we,

68
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,560
my students and I shed light on the
process of linguistic generativity or

69
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:41,080
creativity in general.
Um,

70
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,170
I also
tried very hard to crack the code of

71
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:51,421
what verbs mean and how that influences
how we use them in sentences.

72
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,730
The verb is in a way the chassis of the
sentence,

73
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,420
once you pick the verb,
it's got slots that the rest of the

74
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,890
sentence a is built around the subject,
the object,

75
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:06,280
the indirect object,
prepositional objects and so on.

76
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,370
So knowing how the verb works tells you
a lot about how the sentence works and

77
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,740
how the verb works depends on what the
verb means.

78
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,530
You might think,
how could you ever get your,

79
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,690
uh,
get a handle on something as nebulous as

80
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,070
what a verb means.
But,

81
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:25,360
um,
but I like to think that,

82
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,400
um,
that I,

83
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,800
I cracked a lot of that code.
What's the difference between a verb,

84
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:35,770
like to fill in a verb,
like to pour and a verb,

85
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:40,771
like to load.
They're not just a video images in the

86
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,360
head of someone pouring and filling and
loading,

87
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,810
but rather they have an anatomy.
They built out a parts parts,

88
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:51,811
like two cars to move a means versus end
a let versus four versus cost.
