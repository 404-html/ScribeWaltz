1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,860
I grew up in the fringes of the oil
business in Tulsa,

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,700
Tulsa called itself the oil capital of
the world in the 19 fifties and it

3
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:15,870
wasn't real far off.
It was very central to a lot of oil

4
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:17,100
companies,
oil equipment,

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:19,110
and the rest and most people in
business,

6
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:22,110
a very large share of them were in the
oil business in one way or another.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,110
Well,
so anybody who's familiar with the oil

8
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:30,111
business knows that up until the early
20th century you could only get gasoline

9
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:34,020
from a tiny share of petroleum,
but first with thermal cracking and then

10
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:37,810
in the thirties catalytic cracking,
you could use much larger share,

11
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:40,410
70,
80 percent maybe of oil to produce

12
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:44,190
gasoline.
And it was that expansion of the

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:49,230
feedstock that made possible the
Transportation Revolution of the early

14
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:51,360
20th century.
As a reason,

15
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:55,020
gasoline was twenty five cents a gallon
when I was growing up in Tulsa.

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,410
Detroit doesn't produce the oil
and the United States produces some oil

17
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:05,490
certainly,
and we're going to need oil for a long

18
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:10,350
time,
but if we can get to a lot less oil than

19
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:13,740
we have now,
we can do something very important.

20
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:18,060
I'll give you one example.
Any corn of the Igs,

21
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:21,720
a think tank in in Washington that
promotes

22
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,600
working on energy for national security
purposes says that um,

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,040
up until the late 19th,
early 20th century salt was a strategic

24
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:36,710
commodity.
There was no other way to preserve meat.

25
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,590
Preserving meat was hugely important for
the human diet,

26
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,940
huge share of the human food chain.
So people who had salt mines and

27
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:47,700
countries that had salt mines were
really important.

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,260
Believe it or not,
countries fought wars over salt.

29
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,930
That changed with refrigeration.
Now we still use salt.

30
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,810
Probably we still use it some to
preserve meat,

31
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,260
but mainly we use it for flavoring and
one thing or another,

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,670
unless you are intimately familiar with
Morton's,

33
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:11,100
you probably don't have any idea where
it comes from.

34
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,280
You don't care.
It's bought and sold on a market.

35
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,620
It's a commodity like a lot of other
commodities,

36
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,300
but nobody is going to order you around
because he's got salt and you don't,

37
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,850
well,
we need to do that oil,

38
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,110
we need to destroy,
not oil,

39
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,650
but we need to destroy it as a strategic
commodity so we don't need it for

40
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,320
transportation.
There are real competitors and the

41
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:42,690
competitors,
electricity,

42
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,720
alternative fuels together in one.
Some combination,

43
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,840
um,
can get the job done at that point.

44
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,110
Oil becomes like lots of other
commodities and by the way,

45
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:55,950
it becomes much more operative in a free
market because what you have now is not

46
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:56,610
a free market.

47
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,610
OPEC runs at a cartel and they are able
run it with Saudi Arabia leading it a

48
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,180
because it's a strategic commodity and
there was no other way for most people

49
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,510
and most structures in the world to
propel their vehicles around except

50
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:14,630
with,
with the oil,

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,340
petroleum derived fuels.
If we can end that.

52
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,280
So there are some competitors that are
close to oils cost like cellulosic

53
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:26,660
ethanol and others like,
um,

54
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,600
electricity.
There are much cheaper.

55
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,350
People are still gonna want oil.
Depends on how cheap it is.

56
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:35,080
Whether they use oil or natural gas in
the chemical plant,

57
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,680
etc. Fine.
Don't want to destroy oil.

58
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,140
Want to do to it.
What reFrigeration did assault.
