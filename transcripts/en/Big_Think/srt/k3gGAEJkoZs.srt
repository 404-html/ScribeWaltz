1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,330
Generally worked on problems by looking
at how can we solve the problem,

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,580
but that's very much a fixed mindset.
You know,

3
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:19,581
here's the problem and what can we do to
solve it and technology advances in

4
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:24,540
technology have enabled us to do that
and is that important?

5
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,120
Of course it is.
It's necessary,

6
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:32,121
but it's not sufficient.
So how can we solve problems in an

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,730
enduring way,
in an equitable way,

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,970
in a way where nobody really loses
because too often we look at an issue

9
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:47,961
from a scarcity mindset,
but frankly we have an abundant planet

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,650
and we have people with so much
creativity.

11
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,950
Can we engage that way differently?
So that's what this journey is about.

12
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,590
Awakening the space within me and within
everybody else and it's about awakening

13
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,890
and articulating what we see through our
pattern mind.

14
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,840
And third,
it's about solving problems through that

15
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,883
space.

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,040
It's not about fixing it.
And what's amazing is that people have

17
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,650
innate attributes worldwide and
neuroscience and recent research shows

18
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:32,931
that what we can see is that human
beings have a sense of self,

19
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,720
their own self worth,
which we often,

20
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,420
you know,
talk about as dignity.

21
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:43,920
So they have a sense of self worldwide.
It doesn't matter whether we are rich,

22
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,030
we are poor,
whether we follow any faith or whether

23
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:52,740
we
vote for a particular political party.

24
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,780
This transcends all those divides,
the social isms that we've created.

25
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,170
So basically the sense of self worth
exists and the sense of fairness exists

26
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:07,680
worldwide.
And so very often people ask me,

27
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,980
what is it that there's so much inequity
in the world and you say that we have an

28
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:16,950
innate sense of fairness.
In fact,

29
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:21,951
Oxfam did a study in the US and they
found that 92 percent of people actually

30
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,260
believe that fairness is important.

31
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,410
How great is that?
So then people say,

32
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:33,411
how come there's so much inequity?
I think a lot of the inequities stems

33
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:39,111
from our understanding of what we need.
Much of that is promoted through

34
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,670
creating demand for things we actually
don't need to a consumerism that's

35
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:51,801
extremely materialistic and this work is
about touching that space.

36
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,000
And this work is also about the third
attribute that is compassion.

37
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,630
What we know now is that people are not
only functioning from their emotional

38
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:07,870
state.
What you know are neuroscientists are

39
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,080
physician will call our limbic system
and our emotional reactions.

40
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:16,510
Not that emotion is not important,
it's important,

41
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,990
but we have a higher consciousness and
activating that consciousness that

42
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:25,750
exists in everyone everywhere and I can
give you many,

43
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:28,330
many stories from around the world about
that.

44
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,140
When we activate that space of our
higher consciousness,

45
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,010
we bring to bear our innate sense of
self,

46
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,070
our sense of fairness,
our compassion.

47
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,660
So compassion.
There's a lovely Sanskrit.

48
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,940
Sanskrit is a based language of of India
and a Sanskrit word Karuna.

49
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,100
Karuna means my,
my universal heart of love has broken

50
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:03,571
open and I'm called to act.
I cannot just bossed by what's not

51
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:06,760
working and say,
well,

52
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,520
it doesn't serve my personal interest in
or I'm called to act.

53
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,450
So for me,
tapping into this spaces worldwide,

54
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,350
which is our inner capacity,
our sense of self,

55
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,890
our sense of fairness,
our knowing of compassion.

56
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,240
This has been the way we've created
change worldwide and it's worked.

57
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,570
We have results in every sector.
