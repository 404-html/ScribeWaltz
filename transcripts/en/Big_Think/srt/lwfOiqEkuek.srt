1
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,850
It's different every time.
And if that years ago there wasn't,

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,150
I did do something like that at a,
for

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,110
a magazine.
Uh,

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,400
we're,
we're a journalist's x who followed me

5
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:24,080
around and we tried to,
but,

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:24,943
but,
um,

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,720
it's,
it's slightly different every time.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,130
My inspiration comes from everywhere,
uh,

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,240
just walking down the street just,
and I never know where it's going to

10
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:34,970
come from.
So I keep a notebook with me at all

11
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:36,010
times.
Um,

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,980
and the only criteria for anything
making it into that notebook is if it

13
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:45,500
stops me in my tracks for even an
instant.

14
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:49,610
If it catches my eye or my ear,
you know,

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,260
and,
and I just write it down.

16
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,960
That means there's,
there are recipes in there,

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,900
you know,
there are words and sometimes there's a

18
00:00:56,901 --> 00:00:59,240
character description or sometimes it's
a line.

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,750
And after that point though,
what happens is kind of odd.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,000
Um,
I tend to,

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,710
I work in fragments in the sense that
I'm not going to sit down and say,

22
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,770
first line is this,
and now I'm going to just write my way

23
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:17,540
through it.
I let the poem,

24
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,460
it's like piecing it together like a
pot.

25
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:22,070
So I'll,
I'll might have a line that I might

26
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:26,180
write down on the middle of a page and I
still write things down with a pen on

27
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:28,670
paper.
I go to the computer when,

28
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,080
when it gets too messy and use it like
an elaborate typewriter because I

29
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:34,550
printed out and then I messed it up
again.

30
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,840
But when I do get down,
sit down to write in my room,

31
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,060
in my study and I tried to write there
at a certain time,

32
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,820
every night I'm a night person,
my best times or midnight to six

33
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:48,760
actually.
Um,

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,620
I'll leave through my notebooks and if
something catches my eye and I feel like

35
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:57,410
I want to transfer it from the notebook
to the page I do.

36
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,750
And then comes this very strange
process,

37
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:07,751
which is difficult to describe and that
I write until I get stuck or I can't go

38
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,510
any further,
I'm boring myself or whatever.

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,980
And then I might go to another poem.
Uh,

40
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,410
I might go to another folder where there
are other drafts of poems in various

41
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:22,940
stages of completion.
And the only way I have for keeping

42
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:27,941
track of all this fragment tarry stuff
is by color.

43
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,130
And I have different colored folders,
red folders,

44
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:32,090
blue,
yellow.

45
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,450
So I might go into my study,
let's say one evening and say I feel

46
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:42,500
like the blue folder today
and not pick up the blue folder and see

47
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:46,220
what's in there.
So it's something that I've kind of

48
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:50,660
worked at over the years,
but the colors are only because I didn't

49
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:53,740
want to put anything.
I didn't want to file anything in a,

50
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,920
in a straight.

51
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,400
Um,
I think if you put something in a file

52
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:03,401
that says war poems or loved pumps,
but you already restrict the way in

53
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:07,360
which the poem might move.
If I put it in blue,

54
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,350
it could be sad blue,
it could be happy blue,

55
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:16,351
it can be peaceful blue.
But my mood at the moment when I'm about

56
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:21,370
to work on that poem once will tell me
where I want to go.

57
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,200
So it's an odd process,
but I do do lots of revisions and I love

58
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:27,380
to revise.
Um,

59
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,240
so 30 40 revisions is not unusual at
this stage.

60
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,210
Uh,
I do most of my revisions by myself

61
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:42,211
until I reach a point where I either
need to give it lots of time because

62
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:44,470
time is a great reviser too.
You know,

63
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,630
months of,
of putting it aside or I will show it.

64
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,520
A lot of times I'll show it to my,
my husband who is a novelist and as a

65
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:57,940
prose writer,
he has a totally different take on

66
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:58,450
things.

67
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,390
So he comes at it a different way.
Um,

68
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,840
I yearn for those old days,
you know,

69
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,850
both from graduate school,
right?

70
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,570
You go into a workshop and people would
give you all these ideas and you take it

71
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:12,580
away from me.
But at this point,

72
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,570
um,
that just doesn't,

73
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,790
it's not in the card.
So

74
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,820
I think it's both.
I think that that you certainly don't

75
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:27,670
have to be aged and you know,
and,

76
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,950
and travel the world to write a poem.
In fact,

77
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:32,290
sometimes traveling the world is,
is,

78
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,400
is a way of not writing a poem,
but it's the quality of experiences

79
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,430
being able to,
to experience something.

80
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,300
And when you begin to write about it,
be able to apply the tools that you need

81
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,830
for writing,
you know,

82
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,770
a mastery of the language in a way of,
of,

83
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,281
of,
of,

84
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:56,830
of piecing together the language I
guess,

85
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,520
uh,
that those two factors have to come

86
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:01,354
together.

87
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:06,390
So you do need to be to work at it,
but you also have to be able to know

88
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:10,960
when to,
when to take the experience as it

89
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:13,390
happened,
went to tweak it a little bit.

90
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,510
What part of the experience is going to
move somebody else.

91
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:19,160
And what part is really your own?
Um,

92
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,620
private moment.
So I've,

93
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:26,770
I've seen pumps written by very young
people,

94
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:29,980
which are absolutely stunning.
And of course we have examples,

95
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:33,280
look bored layer and you know,
when it was in his teens,

96
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,400
and these are amazing poem.
So he obviously didn't have a wealth of

97
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:40,030
experience or age or anything like that.
And I've seen poems,

98
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:44,560
which of course could only have been
written by someone who was older and had

99
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,910
lived certain,
you know,

100
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,670
stages of life.
I've gone through certain stages of

101
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:53,440
life,
but it's a combination of the two.

102
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,810
It really is.
You know,

103
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,030
I,
I've always felt that,

104
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,370
that the poems I've written,
which have historical context,

105
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,470
um,
are hopefully not just simply plucking

106
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,640
something out of history and saying,
Ooh,

107
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:16,060
great,
let's write about that in every case.

108
00:06:16,061 --> 00:06:21,061
What has happened is that I've become
fascinated or haunted by something and

109
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:24,370
couldn't shake it as an African
American,

110
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:29,371
as a woman,
I think that I've been sensitized to the

111
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:32,340
way in which history,
uh,

112
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,380
privileges of white male and the way in
which certain aspects of history,

113
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,520
the things that we are taught in school,
the things that are handed down,

114
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,790
never,
never entered the picture that they

115
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,060
might've been very important.
And you want can tell you that,

116
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,270
uh,
at the risk of over simplification,

117
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:54,010
let me say that anyone can tell you
that,

118
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,070
that,
that how you're raised as a child has a

119
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,060
great deal to do with how you behave as
an adult.

120
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,090
And uh,
whether you have complexes or whether

121
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,400
you need to prove yourself or all kinds
of stuff.

122
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,430
And yet
the mother in a traditional family who

123
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:15,190
has raised a chuck never makes it in the
history books.

124
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:16,630
I mean,
so,

125
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,740
so those kinds of things have always
irritated me,

126
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,450
let's put it that way.
And,

127
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:25,510
um,
and I'm always reminded when I,

128
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,820
when I see someone,
you know,

129
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,500
Napoleon's stocks through the
battlefields,

130
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:30,720
and I think,
yeah,

131
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,990
but how did he get that way?
You know,

132
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:35,500
how this guy become who he was.
So that's,

133
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,820
that's the predisposition I had.
I think us as a writer,

134
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:41,420
as a person,
um,

135
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,360
who wanted to create a poetry,
that's one of the things that has always

136
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:48,060
been one of my,
um,

137
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,500
the things I carry along with me
each time is different.

138
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:54,820
For instance,
in this new book,

139
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:57,070
which is,
uh,

140
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,180
tells the story of,
uh,

141
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,320
of,
uh,

142
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,530
black,
uh,

143
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:05,690
mixed race violin is George Bridge Tower
who grew up in 18th and 19th century

144
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:07,414
Europe.

145
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,350
I came upon him because I was watching a
movie,

146
00:08:11,351 --> 00:08:12,370
immortal,
beloved.

147
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,490
And there was a scene which Beethoven
walks by group of musicians and there's

148
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:19,240
this black violin.
And so I'm like,

149
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,460
what I've heard of Colin's like casting
this is a bit strange.

150
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,850
And so I looked him up and the,
I didn't intend to write poems about it.

151
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,100
Um,
I just wanted to know more about him and

152
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:40,110
I kept reading in the more red,
the more I realized the only way I was

153
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:45,151
going to get him out of my head was to
get into his and start writing by him.

154
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:47,800
So in each case,
it's,

155
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,880
it's been something like that.
Um.
