1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,500
Well,
in general terms,

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,600
I'm in the business of really creating
intellectual capital or creating ideas,

3
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,110
um,
for uh,

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,380
looking at a different way at very
large,

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,120
messy,
complicated problems,

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,050
all of which have something to do with
competition and,

7
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,000
uh,
economic value and,

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,080
and,
uh,

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,770
really delivering value in terms of
organizations working.

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:38,920
So,
uh,

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:39,883
it,
it,

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,360
it's,
I started out with a fairly focused,

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,520
although very complicated question,
which is,

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,640
you know,
what makes some industries prosper.

15
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,720
None others,
uh,

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,010
and then later what makes some companies
prosper and others,

17
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,630
um,
but ultimately that,

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,780
that core set of ideas and frameworks
and ways of thinking gave rise to work

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,990
in some very powerfully connected areas
like economic development and,

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,870
and most recently in healthcare
delivery.

21
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,570
Again,
healthcare delivery is,

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,980
is a large complex multidimensional
problem,

23
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,420
involves organizations delivering value
who are competing in,

24
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:17,490
in,
in some way against other entities.

25
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:22,491
And so that class of problems is,
are the ones that I've evolved my work

26
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,430
in,
in,

27
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,170
into,
into looking at an.

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,200
And although I have a hopeless,
hopelessly broad bandwidth and the sense

29
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:32,730
of working a lot of different fields.
I work in the environment,

30
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:35,250
I work in social responsibility,
philanthropy.

31
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,710
It all emanates from that common set of
perspectives and ways of looking at an

32
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:43,950
organization's doing something to
deliver value.

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,681
Well,
you know,

34
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:51,000
I,
I suspect,

35
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,920
uh,
just just,

36
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,830
you know,
traveling around the world and talking

37
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:57,640
to people and meeting people that,
uh,

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,710
probably at this moment in history,
I probably that'd be best known for

39
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:03,900
this,
the notion of the five forces because

40
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:06,620
it's such a visible and,
and,

41
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:11,160
and,
and sort of a sort of clear framework

42
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,830
that when,
when people encounter it,

43
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,950
uh,
all of a sudden it kind of totally

44
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:18,480
changes the way they look,
you know,

45
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:20,550
at,
at an industries and markets and,

46
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,490
and,
uh,

47
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,520
a lot of students get exposed to it
during their training and,

48
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:30,120
and therefore it still sticks with them.
I think probably the close second would

49
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:31,700
be the,
uh,

50
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,360
the value chain,
the notion of,

51
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,050
of,
of how we think about how an entity

52
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:41,340
actually creates value and think about
the cost of creating that value and in a

53
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:42,270
systematic way.

54
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,470
I mean,
again,

55
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,360
if my roots are in economics and,
and that's where my doctorate is in,

56
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:49,440
in economics,
there's a very simple conception of the

57
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:52,590
firm which is there's a production
function and there's labor capital

58
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,870
that's converted into output and,
and,

59
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,180
and,
and that's fine for many economic

60
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:59,010
applications,
but in order to really understand,

61
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,390
thinking about strategy and competition
and value,

62
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,900
you need to go beyond that.
So I think probably that then would come

63
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:07,120
the,
the diamond theory for looking at

64
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,490
locations and clusters,
which is a close cousin.

65
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:11,650
So there,
there's been a succession of these,

66
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,820
of these frameworks.
Um,

67
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,850
and you know,
I'm not done.

68
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,140
I'm,
I'm,

69
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,570
you know,
I,

70
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,470
I keep,
I keep pounding away at these kinds of

71
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:23,830
problems because what I find is that
today,

72
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,110
as we,
as we think about how ideas develop it,

73
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:30,250
certainly in the economic and managerial
domain,

74
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,590
there's,
there's a tendency to reduction reduced,

75
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,860
to simplify,
to,

76
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,560
to partition,
to specialize,

77
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:40,240
to look at the piece,
if you will.

78
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:42,130
Not the whole.
And of course,

79
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:43,390
rolling Christiansen,
my,

80
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,790
My,
my beloved mentor,

81
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,390
you know,
this was his sermon almost everyday in

82
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:52,720
class that it's the whole,
it's the parts are important,

83
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:54,790
it's the whole,
there's something unique about the whole

84
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,850
and how you think about the whole and
how you get the parts to fit together.

85
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:01,810
And that's the essence of what creates
true success in,

86
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,620
in most situations.
And so it's,

87
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,660
it's that struggle to understand the
whole and in these interrelated domains

88
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:09,460
that,
that really motivates me.

89
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,071
Well,
you know,

90
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:15,670
I,
I,

91
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,610
this is a horrendous answer for it,
for a strategy professor,

92
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:21,010
but I'm working on everything.
Um,

93
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,541
and,
uh,

94
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,360
I would say that I continue to try to
advance,

95
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,260
you know,
all of my,

96
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,680
my major bodies of work.
But if,

97
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,560
if you wanted to identify what would be
the really the,

98
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,440
the,
the dominant intellectual agenda right

99
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,340
now,
it would be the continuing pursuit of

100
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,280
this kind of body of work on healthcare
delivery.

101
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,020
And most recently,
uh,

102
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,490
through some relationships with folks at
the medical school and elsewhere,

103
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:52,060
I've really gotten interested in
problems of global health delivery in,

104
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,290
in developing countries settings.
Uh,

105
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,860
which again,
initially looked like a totally

106
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,160
different problem than,
you know,

107
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,260
healthcare in the US,
but the more deeply I think in the more

108
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,750
you look at that at first principles
level,

109
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,550
uh,
you,

110
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,480
you see that the problems are very,
very similar.

111
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,480
So the hope is that we can create a
partnership which allows us to better

112
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,010
harness the massive amounts of resources
that are now going into fighting

113
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:21,600
diseases like aids and malaria and
resistant tb by,

114
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,610
by really revolutionizing our thinking
about how to deliver care,

115
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,683
see the,
the,

116
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,940
the,
the thinking about healthcare in general

117
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:31,000
and global health in particular has been
dominated by the science perspective.

118
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:32,500
You know,
how can we come up with the better

119
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:34,230
malaria pill or a,
a,

120
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,170
a way of,
you know,

121
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,890
using drugs to treat TB.
And what we've come to understand is,

122
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,160
is that the,
that the gaining force is actually not

123
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:43,990
the science.
It's actually delivered and,

124
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:45,940
and,
and delivery is complicated.

125
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,240
You have to see it as a system.
You can't just look at the individual

126
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:51,880
parts of how you do one therapy.
Here are one therapy there.

127
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:54,710
You have to see the overall delivery
system and,

128
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,800
and,
and research in global health has not

129
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,810
really been able to take that
perspective,

130
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:02,720
just given the scientific roots of,
of,

131
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,680
of,
of most,

132
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:04,370
of,
of research.

133
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,140
I mean,
one of the very interesting issues in,

134
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:06,611
in,
in,

135
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:09,800
in,
in this may be a whole new subject we

136
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:13,700
could talk about for hours.
This is the nature of intellectual

137
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:14,960
endeavor and,
and,

138
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,510
um,
and,

139
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,100
and even in business and even in
economics,

140
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,630
we keep trying to make every problem
into a physics problem where,

141
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,380
where you're down at the micro micro,
micro level and there's little particles

142
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:32,030
behaving on the basis of a few forces
that we can model mathematically and

143
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:33,720
then simulate.
And so what,

144
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,030
what we're,
what we're,

145
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,130
what we have in most important things in
the world.

146
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:41,960
We have these complicated human systems
where there's lots of complexity and

147
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:44,630
multidimensionality and interdependence
and,

148
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,980
and,
and we simply keep failing whenever we

149
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:51,590
don't capture that in our ways of
thinking in our frameworks.

150
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:53,630
And so that,
that's Kinda what I try to do,

151
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,860
uh,
uh,

152
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:56,530
with,
with varying success and,

153
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:58,220
and,
and constantly learning.

154
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,630
Okay?

155
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,790
Oh Gosh,
there,

156
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,850
there's,
there's,

157
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,190
there's,
there's so many interesting people

158
00:07:09,191 --> 00:07:10,780
doing,
doing interesting work and,

159
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:11,680
and I,
I'm,

160
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,440
I'm very,
a collectic in the sense that I think

161
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:19,060
all kinds of work can actually
contribute to our knowledge of these

162
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:21,700
phenomena.
I mean,

163
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,470
you know,
in,

164
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,100
in,
in the area of health,

165
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,800
uh,
I think actually the practitioners are

166
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:29,080
ahead of the theorists,
uh,

167
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,640
so,
you know,

168
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:31,510
people like,
uh,

169
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,480
you know,
Paul Farmer and partners in health I

170
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:37,960
think are the ones that are on the
frontier of new delivery models.

171
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:39,580
Really.
You don't see it in the academic

172
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:41,060
writing.
Um,

173
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,710
uh,
you know,

174
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,800
I'm,
I'm very taken with a lot of what's

175
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:47,440
happening here year around the Cambridge
community.

176
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:50,230
I mean the brode institute and the
ability to kind of,

177
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,010
uh,
kind of marry science and practice in

178
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:55,260
the human genome project.
I,

179
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,830
I get very excited about that.

180
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,040
Um,
in,

181
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,480
in the economic sphere.
I think the growing awareness that

182
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,360
people are not robots and,
and,

183
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:07,570
and their behavioral phenomenon that
guide,

184
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,970
you know,
how people make choices in the economy.

185
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:13,560
So the scholars that work on behavioral
finance and um,

186
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,610
and,
and it's kind of simulation of,

187
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,020
of how of how,
uh,

188
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,960
actors really make choices of which
there are a number,

189
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:22,000
uh,
here in Cambridge and elsewhere are

190
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,650
good.
So those are the kinds of things that

191
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:24,920
attract me,
um,

192
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,980
um,
you know,

193
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,220
people that are,
are trying to bringing a,

194
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,770
kind of a fresh,
new perspective to a problem that was

195
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:37,771
sort of received and well understood.
I would say that,

196
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,183
um,

197
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,590
okay.

198
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,800
You know,
I believe that the,

199
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:48,120
the sort of frameworks and,
and ideas and ways of looking at these,

200
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:49,900
this series of problems,
um,

201
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,960
I think the most important contribution
is that those ways of thinking have,

202
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,050
um,
if substantially affected and

203
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:03,450
transformed thinking in those respective
fields.

204
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,560
Uh,
and,

205
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:08,010
and that's ultimately what I care about.
I,

206
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,270
I'm,
you know,

207
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:11,450
like most of us here at Hbs,
I,

208
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,250
I'm deeply,
deeply rooted in practice.

209
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:14,700
I,
I,

210
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,380
what I really care about is not so much
the publication or the idea in its own

211
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:19,951
right,
but,

212
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:23,370
but actually the ability of a practice,
a practitioner to do better,

213
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:25,290
to,
to deliver better value,

214
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,810
the ability of a government official or,
or,

215
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:28,500
or,
or,

216
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,720
or,
uh,

217
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,540
another stake holder to actually make
better choices in terms of developing

218
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,200
the economy of a particular region.
Um,

219
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,670
it,
it's really changing the way people

220
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,460
think and uh,
and,

221
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,750
and,
and seeing that reflected in,

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,810
in actual practice.
And that's when I'm,

223
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,200
I feel like I've made my biggest
contribution and I feel,

224
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:50,600
I feel like,
you know,

225
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,680
that that contribution has,
has,

226
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,150
has been,
has been meaningful.

227
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,380
Um,
and,

228
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,340
and uh,
again,

229
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:58,380
that,
that cuts across a variety of different

230
00:09:58,381 --> 00:09:59,520
fields.
But wherever,

231
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:01,620
wherever that happens,
that's,

232
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,730
that's the contribution.
I think I'm the proud of stuff.

233
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,980
I think as we look at questions like
strategy or,

234
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,390
or,
um,

235
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,450
um,
economic development or,

236
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,140
you know,
read,

237
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,740
restructuring,
healthcare delivery or revitalizing

238
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:24,370
intercity economies,
you know,

239
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,570
through,
through different sets of policies.

240
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,820
I think,
you know,

241
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:31,350
and this may be a,
this is

242
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,470
always a dangerous thing to say,
but I think that we are much closer now

243
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,830
to understanding what it is that works.
Um,

244
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,140
so,
um,

245
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,510
now the,
the,

246
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:49,511
the real critical questions we often
face are given even even if we know what

247
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,870
works,
how do we actually mobilize a community

248
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:58,650
or a set of actors or policymakers
actually do that thing.

249
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,200
So again,
we see this an economic development all

250
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:02,090
the time.
Uh,

251
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,170
you know,
I can take,

252
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,960
take you to 10 countries and we can,
you know,

253
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:12,020
I could literally in 15 minutes we can
identify six or seven critical policy

254
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:16,260
priorities that will make an immense
difference in the wellbeing of the

255
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:17,160
citizens of that country.

256
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,540
And yet the stuff doesn't get done.
It doesn't get done for a variety of

257
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,130
reasons.
Partly it doesn't get done because

258
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:25,840
people don't have the right ideas.
Bad ideas are,

259
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,020
are a huge part of the problem in this
world,

260
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,500
but it also doesn't get done because we
don't understand exactly yet how change

261
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:36,600
processes work,
how to mobilize those change processes.

262
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:39,840
So it's really the thing that keeps me
up at night is,

263
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,430
is,
you know,

264
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,670
how can we get participants in these,
uh,

265
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,820
in these complex systems where there's
always multiple participants and they

266
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:53,680
have to sign of agree and work together
to come up with it with a good outcome.

267
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,840
How do we get them working together?
It's kind of worth it.

268
00:11:55,841 --> 00:12:00,841
Chris Argyris and others who,
who work on sort of change processes and

269
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:04,540
constructive reasoning and how,
how people can actually learn and adapt

270
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,750
and change.
Those are the issues I think are,

271
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:11,200
are really the compelling issues now in
more and more aspects of society.

272
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,140
Um,
it,

273
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,420
it's,
it's not the what,

274
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,950
it's,
how do we get there?

275
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,481
Well,
I mean,

276
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:25,840
I think there has been a big divide
between those who think about those who

277
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:27,610
act.
I think certainly my,

278
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,120
my work and whatever success I've had is
partly because I had been able to break

279
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:35,830
that divide a little bit and be very,
very informed about the phenomenon at a

280
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,400
great level of tail.
Therefore,

281
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,000
the theory and frameworks that I develop
capture complexity rather than abstract

282
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:45,010
away the complexity.
Um,

283
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,520
I wish more academics would,
um,

284
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,393
would,
would,

285
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:56,430
would do that would sort of live that
bridging themselves rather than see

286
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:01,960
their role as,
as solely solely the thinking part.

287
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,380
Um,
um,

288
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,930
and um,
you know,

289
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:08,890
I don't know how to create the right
incentives and values in the fields to

290
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:10,050
do that because,
uh,

291
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,321
uh,
you know,

292
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:13,990
right now the pressures are a little bit
the opposite.

293
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,893
Uh,
the,

294
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,780
the pressures are to specialize to focus
on refereed publications in the academy

295
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:23,250
and you get very little credit for,
for going into the field and,

296
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,490
and,
and engaging the practitioners and

297
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,810
understanding the phenomena firsthand
and therefore getting better insights

298
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:31,150
into how to apply ideas.
Um,

299
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,090
that's,
that's,

300
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,040
that's fairly rare and very hard to
sustain so far.

301
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:41,041
Now what you find is that the people who
can actually do that and we'll do that,

302
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,010
uh,
can often have huge impact,

303
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:48,400
but perversely,
I think the sort of the immediate

304
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:51,430
incentives that many,
many scholars feel or are really not to

305
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,340
make those investments.
So it's a real,

306
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,030
it's a real challenge on this
fragmentation of knowledge and ideas.

307
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,470
Um,
is,

308
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,221
is,
again,

309
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:01,031
one of,
to me,

310
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:05,710
one of our compelling issues,
not just in academia but also in society

311
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:06,544
as a whole.

312
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,330
That's the market failure and uh,
you know,

313
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,640
how we,
how we think about solving that market

314
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:19,460
failure.
And uh,

315
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,341
now,
you know,

316
00:14:20,341 --> 00:14:20,650
I,
I,

317
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,650
I sense a glimmer of change in,
in some of the very young people that I

318
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:31,161
encounter now who are more problem
focused then literature focused or,

319
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:32,030
or,
or,

320
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,860
or fields focused.
And if you,

321
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,940
if,
if you're really,

322
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:39,930
if your real passion is solving societal
problems,

323
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,090
uh,
or a puzzle,

324
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,550
um,
and you can stay grounded in that,

325
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:48,480
that helps you kind of work across
across boundaries.

326
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:49,680
But,
um,

327
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,790
and I think if have a new generation of,
of,

328
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,200
of,
of young people who,

329
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,290
who really are passionate about the
problems that they see in the world and

330
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,160
can really have that be their highest
calling,

331
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:03,200
I think that would be very optimistic.
Step forward.
