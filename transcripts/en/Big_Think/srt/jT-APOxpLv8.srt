1
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,220
I would like to feel that my work has
impact in the world,

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,420
but I also need to approach this
question with a certain degree of

3
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:15,770
humility.
I mean,

4
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:20,210
we had Harvard sometimes think that
we're part of the greatest university in

5
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:23,420
the world,
but there are lots of other places now

6
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:26,810
that are also doing great things.
My work,

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,060
if I have influenced some people,
some people in leadership positions to

8
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:35,300
do things differently.
That's the important thing.

9
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,030
I do have many,
many people who read my books,

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,170
they quote me.
Um,

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,140
I'm sometimes recognized in airports,
but I also sit at meetings with world

12
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:48,560
leaders where I am convinced of my utter
irrelevance.

13
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,740
Um,
so I think that I have,

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,650
um,
had an impact in terms of the term

15
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:58,040
empowerment and the importance of
empowering people.

16
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:01,220
I think my work on change has guided
many,

17
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:04,580
many organizations,
not only through my books but through a

18
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:09,581
change tool kit on the worldwide web
that is being used by many companies and

19
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:15,941
governments around the world.
I think that the ideas have entered into

20
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:20,990
the vocabulary of leadership.
So much so that people sometimes forget

21
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:23,930
that.
I thought of it first and I guess that's

22
00:01:23,931 --> 00:01:27,200
what's important because I'm going to go
on to the next idea.

23
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,710
Oh,
my proudest achievement is,

24
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,890
it's so hard to say.
My proudest achievement is generally the

25
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:41,891
most recent because of.
Because I had just put in so much effort

26
00:01:42,621 --> 00:01:45,440
and so much struggle to do it.
I really work hard.

27
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,090
None of it comes easy.
So I think of my books as proud

28
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:52,460
achievements,
but I'm always proudest of the most

29
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:57,140
recent because I think that I've gone
further in whatever that is.

30
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,530
I'm certainly proud of my son of,
of being able to have a life

31
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:07,430
sufficiently balanced that I could have
a good family life and um,

32
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,820
and set forth my son upon the world.
I'm certainly proud of,

33
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,990
of the companies I've changed of the
ideas I've spawned and I could point to

34
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:22,550
particular ones of the presidential
campaigns that I've influenced of the

35
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:24,320
world leaders,
um,

36
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,510
with whom I've shared the stage and
numerous events who had already been

37
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:33,200
using my ideas,
but then go back and have learned

38
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:35,810
something that often shapes their
agenda.

39
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,910
I'm asked questions like,
well,

40
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:41,210
what should be the most important
priority for Columbia?

41
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,590
And I answer those questions,
so it's thought leadership,

42
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:50,591
it's working with the power of ideas and
it's wonderful that in this world of

43
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:56,561
giant enterprises,
ibm as 350,000 people and enormously

44
00:02:57,741 --> 00:03:02,741
advanced technology and yet one person
whispering in the ear of a world leader

45
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:09,241
or an IBM executive can often change the
course of that company and sometimes the

46
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:12,790
course of history,

47
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,650
women in business

48
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,700
as well as women in leadership positions
in any sector have been something that

49
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:26,610
I've been very concerned about my entire
professional life.

50
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,960
And I have to say it was selfish because
I got my phd at a time when there were

51
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:37,491
very few people like me.
I was often the first of my kind sitting

52
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:42,870
in a room with people of another kind.
That's sometimes true by the way,

53
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:47,820
when I go as an American to the Middle
East now where I'm very different in

54
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:51,120
many respects.
So I was very concerned about,

55
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,830
um,
getting more women.

56
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,390
I thought it was in my self interest to
have my women colleagues first of all.

57
00:03:57,391 --> 00:04:01,110
Then the whole image of women would
would have been elevated,

58
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,920
but also I wouldn't have had to sit
there and answer silly questions about

59
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:08,820
what's the women's point of view that I
wanted more at the table.

60
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,740
I also do care about opportunity and I
care about not breaking,

61
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,260
not being confined.
I care about,

62
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:21,000
I care about opportunity and I care
about not being trapped behind

63
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:24,870
stereotypes,
so now we've had the breakthroughs.

64
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,370
There's certainly more women in
leadership positions and lots and lots

65
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:33,930
of women in the pipeline.
What I'm concerned about now is that we

66
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:38,931
haven't changed institutions enough to
make it possible for women who want to

67
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:45,951
devote themselves to their children
during formative years to do that or for

68
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:49,200
men for that matter who say,
no,

69
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:52,770
I'd like to devote my time to my
children to do that.

70
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,950
Without feeling they sacrifice their
careers.

71
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,330
I think we still don't have enough women
in leadership to make it totally normal.

72
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,480
Or we wouldn't ask today's silly woman
question,

73
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:06,960
which is was carly Fiorina fired because
she was a woman?

74
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,300
And the answer is no.
She wasn't,

75
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:14,301
but all the attention she got afterwards
was because we had so few women ceos,

76
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:18,540
we didn't take it for granted,
but I think we have to get more women in

77
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,050
leadership.

78
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,890
In order to do that,
we need to help those talented women in

79
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:27,891
the pipeline feel that they can continue
to advance without sacrificing important

80
00:05:29,641 --> 00:05:32,340
things to them in life.
They don't have to sacrifice their

81
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:35,100
career,
nor do they have to sacrifice their

82
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:39,180
family.
I think that more men ought to take on

83
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:42,390
some of those family responsibilities.
That was important to me.

84
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:47,391
I always felt there was a reason for two
parents and my husband did a great deal

85
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:51,510
and so we could lead more balanced
lives.

86
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,780
I think that to me is the frontier is
what we do about work and family work

87
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,200
life balance,
and if we crack that,

88
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,530
we will see all those talented women
taking on responsibilities and it will

89
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:10,571
look completely normal to have women do
important leadership tasks.
