1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,850
Studies of children that we are born 
with,

2
00:00:09,851 --> 00:00:14,200
this instinct for what's called 
substance dualism.

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,400
The idea that the,
the body and the mind or soul,

4
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:21,940
however you want to think of the psyche 
are separate.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,553
Children who are as young as three or 
four years old who have not grown up 

6
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:32,341
with any kind of religious instruction 
naturally assume that they have a soul,

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,880
and so I think a lot of theorists 
believed that this is this belief in the

8
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:44,011
soul is universal.
That it can be traced back deep into our

9
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:45,550
evolution.
Why?

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,490
There's a whole host of reasons for 
that.

11
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:51,700
I mean,
I suppose that if you're an unbeliever,

12
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:54,970
you think that it's just some kind of 
evolutionary accident.

13
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,420
It's a trick of the mind,
if as it were,

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,600
that makes you think that you are an 
immaterial being inside a material body.

15
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,063
If you're a believer,
you think that it's probably because 

16
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:09,154
there is a soul and maybe perhaps that 
we were intentionally created in such a 

17
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:19,321
way as to think that there is more to us
than just the material realm.

18
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,280
It's really a choice,
but what cannot be denied is that belief

19
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,173
in the soul is a belief that all peoples
share regardless of their culture or 

20
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:31,984
their religion,
and it's a belief that goes back as far 

21
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:38,380
back in time as we can possibly a trace 
it.

22
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,570
And if these psychological studies that 
I was talking about are right,

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,780
it's a belief that we're born with over 
the last couple of hundred years,

24
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:51,781
there's been an enormous amount of 
thought that's gone into the question of

25
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:54,940
why religion.
You know,

26
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:55,774
the one thing that we all agree on is 
that religion has been a part of the 

27
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:04,090
human experience from the beginning.
In fact,

28
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:09,300
we can trace the origin of religious 
experience to before homo sapiens.

29
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,953
We can check,
we can trace it with some measure of 

30
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:13,924
confidence to neanderthals.
We can measure it with a little less 

31
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,340
confidence all the way to homo erectus.

32
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,173
So we're talking hundreds of thousands 
of years before our species even 

33
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,020
existed.
So the question is why?

34
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,270
You know,
if religion is a universal phenomenon or

35
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:36,610
rather I should say,
religious experience.

36
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:40,060
If religious experience is a universal 
phenomenon,

37
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,200
if it can be traced in all peoples,
all cultures,

38
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:45,034
and throughout all time,
then there must be some evolutionary 

39
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:50,830
reason for it.
There must be a reason,

40
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:51,664
some adaptive advantage to having 
religious experience or or faith 

41
00:02:57,641 --> 00:02:59,360
experience,
uh,

42
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,423
otherwise it wouldn't exist.
And so there have been over the last 

43
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,883
couple of centuries,
numerous attempts to figure out exactly 

44
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:12,571
what that adaptive advantage would be.
The most popular explanation of course,

45
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,893
is the sociological one,
that religion creates a sense of 

46
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,140
cohesion amongst a group and that that 
sense of cohesion,

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,973
the idea that we could come together and
create a collective identity based on 

48
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,463
shared symbols or shared metaphors gave 
an adaptive advantage to believing 

49
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:38,530
communities that nonbelievers 
communities did not have.

50
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,713
That's a pretty good answer.
The problem is that religion is as much 

51
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,350
a divisive issue as it is a cohesive 
one.

52
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:52,330
It says a good at creating outgroups as 
it is in groups,

53
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,140
and more importantly,
the problem with that,

54
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,303
the social cohesion theory,
is that a kinship was a much more 

55
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:07,741
powerful and much more dominant form of 
social cohesion than religion was.

56
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,430
Our ancestors lived in small communities
that were bound together by,

57
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,410
by blood,
by relationship,

58
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:18,580
by,
by kinship,

59
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,880
a long before they created symbols and 
mythologies in order to unify them.

60
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,730
So it's a pretty good answer,
but it doesn't really,

61
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,060
it doesn't really explain what adaptive 
advantage religion would have had.

62
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,800
Others have said,
well,

63
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:38,590
it's about giving us,
you know,

64
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,453
answers to the,
the unanswerable questions of the world 

65
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:47,150
that what it did was create a sense of 
um,

66
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,343
uh,
knowledge about the universe that 

67
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,270
lessened anxiety in some way.

68
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,000
Uh,
and that was an adaptive advantage.

69
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,330
Well,
even if that were true and there's truly

70
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,270
no reason scientifically to think that 
it was,

71
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,423
it's really hard to make an argument 
about why that would necessarily be an 

72
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:06,604
adaptive advantage,
particularly because religion actually 

73
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,740
causes far more anxiety than it lessons.
In fact,

74
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,903
to put it in evolutionary terms,
the cost of religious expression is 

75
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:24,460
enormous.
It's enormous in terms of time.

76
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,200
It's enormous in terms of the cognitive 
processes that are involved in it.

77
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,430
Um,
it,

78
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,443
it sort of creates greater anxiety when 
you feel as though your actions have 

79
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:41,611
cosmic significance.
All of this is to say that the countless

80
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:47,341
different answers that have been given 
for why religion fail,

81
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,993
primarily because they're functionalist 
answers what they primarily say is what 

82
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:57,220
religion does,
not why religion exists,

83
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,053
and so a group of cognitive scientists,
particularly cognitive scientists who 

84
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:07,931
focus on religion,
have tried to look to a different way of

85
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:09,794
answering this question of why religion 
and what they've discovered is that 

86
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,510
number one,
there is in the end,

87
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:20,780
no adaptive advantage to religious 
faith.

88
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,490
And number two,
that the reason that religion exists,

89
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,320
it's big,
is because it is an accidental byproduct

90
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,333
of some other adaptive advantage.
And here we get into very complicated 

91
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:41,411
conversations about cognitive theory and
the development of our frontal lobes and

92
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:43,760
things like that.
But to put it in its simplest way,

93
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,050
religious thinking is embedded in our 
cognitive processes.

94
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,460
It is a mode of knowing we're born with 
it.

95
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,890
It's part of our DNA.
The question then becomes why.

96
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,870
One answer is that there is no why.
It's just simply an accident of other,

97
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:08,300
much more important,
much more necessary,

98
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,830
uh,
cognitive,

99
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,330
uh,
adaptions,

100
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,100
uh,
adaptations I should say.

101
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,940
Um,
or if you're a believer,

102
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,893
you would say because we were made that 
way because we are designed to believe 

103
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:28,160
that there is more to this world than 
the material realm,

104
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,090
that that mode of knowing that exists in
our brain is there for a reason.

105
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,930
Either answer is fine.
There are some people who say,

106
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:38,390
well,
what religion really does and the reason

107
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,630
that it exists is that it creates some 
morality,

108
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:42,464
right?
That,

109
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,200
uh,
if we,

110
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,270
if we imagine that there's this absolute
moral law giver,

111
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:49,760
then we're less likely to kill our 
neighbor.

112
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,640
And that creates some sort of adaptive 
advantage.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The problem with that theory of course,
is that the concept of a moral law giver

114
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,933
is barely 5,000
years old and religious expression goes 

115
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,130
hundreds of thousands of years.
I mean,

116
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:08,120
if you even think about the Mesopotamian
gods or the Egyptian gods,

117
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:11,150
and this is against seven or 8,000
years ago,

118
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,390
these were not moral beings.
On the contrary,

119
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:19,030
they were amoral and often immoral 
beings.

120
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:24,031
So the idea that religion is about 
morality is a very new idea.

121
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,880
Others say that religion is about a 
authority.

122
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:29,714
It's a,
it's a way of maintaining control and 

123
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:32,084
power over a group and perhaps those 
groups that were religiously inclined 

124
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,450
had an adaptive advantage because that 
notion of an authority structure allowed

125
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:45,440
them to survive better.

126
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,060
Again,
that's a pretty good answer.

127
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:47,923
The problem is,
is that you're talking about 

128
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,460
institutionalized religious expression,
which maybe maybe it's 12 to 14,000

129
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,680
years old,
uh,

130
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,573
that's as far back as we can trace 
anything that looks like an 

131
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,960
institutional religious authority.
And again,

132
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,363
that does not explain why religion 
existed hundreds of thousands of years 

133
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:15,660
before that.
The truth of the matter is we just don't

134
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,673
know,
but what is a fact is that there is 

135
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:21,024
something in the way that our brains 
work that compel us to believe that we 

136
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:31,890
are more than just the sum of our 
material parts.

137
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,383
That thing is either an echo or an 
accident or it's deliberate and 

138
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:39,354
purposeful and which you decide is 
purely a matter of choice because there 

139
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:47,610
is no proof either way.
