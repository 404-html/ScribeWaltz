1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,980
Well,
let me start with why I got interested

2
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:06,290
in writing about it.
Uh,

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,860
I was directing a bioethics center in
Australia and we were contacted by

4
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:15,861
doctors who had ethical dilemmas.
They were working in a neonatal

5
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:20,070
intensive care units,
intensive care units for very small

6
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:22,350
children.
And they had,

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,670
uh,
conditions,

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,730
which for example,
a spinal Bifida in which in their view

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,690
it was not really a good thing for these
babies to survive.

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,480
Um,
the babies if they did survive would

11
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:39,570
need multiple operations,
uh,

12
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:42,240
would be severely disabled,
uh,

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,070
in various wise and uh,
often the parents also thought that

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,670
given the description of the condition,
it was not going to be a good thing for

15
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:54,720
the babies to survive.
So these babies were essentially being

16
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,050
not treated and the result of being not
treated was that by mostly died before

17
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:02,880
they were six months old.

18
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,800
Almost all of them died before they're
six months old.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,290
Some of them died in the first week or
two,

20
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,780
some of the first month or two and
others.

21
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:11,790
Gradually throughout that first six
months.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,630
And this was a very draining experience
for the parents,

23
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:16,920
the doctors,
the nurses.

24
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:21,030
You had these small babies in the
hospital,

25
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:23,580
but not being treated in order to,
uh,

26
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,740
to make them live.
Um,

27
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,980
but nevertheless living for quite a long
time.

28
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,660
And the doctor said,
you know,

29
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,210
how are we doing the right thing here?
Is this justifiable?

30
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,820
So we,
my colleague,

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,190
Helga cruiser,
and I looked at it and we decided that

32
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,770
yes,
it was a reasonable decision for the

33
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:47,220
parents and doctors to make that it was
better than infants with this condition

34
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,790
should not live based with the most
severe variants of this condition should

35
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:56,010
not live,
but we couldn't defend the idea that the

36
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:58,260
right thing to do then was to let them
die.

37
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,220
Um,
this same slow and painful and as I

38
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:02,970
said,
uh,

39
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,810
terribly emotionally draining on the
parents and others.

40
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,910
So we said,
look,

41
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,170
the difficult decision is whether you
want this infant to live or not.

42
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,840
Um,
that should be a decision for the

43
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:19,800
parents and doctors to make on the basis
of the fullest possible information

44
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:22,920
about what the condition is.
But once you've made that decision,

45
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,250
it should be permissible to make sure
that baby dies swiftly and humanely.

46
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,390
If,
if that's the decision.

47
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:32,610
If your decision is that it's better
that the child should not live,

48
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,630
it should be possible to ensure that the
child dies swiftly and you mainly.

49
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,450
Uh,
and so that's what we,

50
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,160
that's what we proposed.
Now

51
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,770
that's been picked up by a variety of
opponents,

52
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:51,690
both pro life movement people and,
uh,

53
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,700
people in the militant disability
movement,

54
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:55,440
which,
which incidentally didn't really exist

55
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:55,890
at the time.

56
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,550
We wrote,
uh,

57
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,710
we first write about this issue,
uh,

58
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,370
and they've taken us as,
you know,

59
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,530
the stalking horse,
the bogey man if you like.

60
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,540
Um,
uh,

61
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,570
because we're up at front in saying that
we think this is how we should treat

62
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,550
these infants.
Uh,

63
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,690
I can understand to some extent why the
pro life movement takes us that way,

64
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,700
but I think the disability movement or
to be just as upset about letting

65
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:26,650
children die because they have a
disability.

66
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,220
And since that's a very common practice
in many hospitals,

67
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,430
I'm not so sure why they've gone after
us in particular,

68
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,760
rather than after the doctors who are
actually doing it.

69
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,260
Uh,
because I really don't see the

70
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:43,261
difference between letting the children
die and making sure that their death

71
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:45,670
comes swiftly and humanely.
