1
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:10,730
Well,
it's,

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,490
it's,
it's difficult to disentangle,

3
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:14,890
but you can,
you can think about it,

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,510
think about it this way.
Two ways.

5
00:00:16,511 --> 00:00:21,511
One is there's almost nothing done in
Washington d C or on the campaign trail

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,980
without the media involved,
uh,

7
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:27,490
so that the media is constantly on the
mind of every politician and

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,060
policymaker.
The second way to think about it is that

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,560
the media both reflects and shapes any
policy debate.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,250
So in some,
some cases that the framing,

11
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:41,030
the presentation,
uh,

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,330
of,
of an issue with in the news,

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,940
uh,
reflects how strategists are pushing

14
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:50,710
certain packages or a strategic
interpretations into the media coverage

15
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,740
or the nature of the debate that's going
on in Congress.

16
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,050
At other times,
something will appear in the media

17
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:58,780
around a focusing event,
say a natural disaster or a new

18
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:02,170
scientific moment or a will come up with
a new interpretation.

19
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,920
Sometimes journalists are kind of issue
entrepreneurs onto themselves.

20
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,000
They're actually pushing,
um,

21
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,980
a certain direction or a new
re-interpretation on policies.

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,420
And Your Times magazine article is a
good example.

23
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,180
Um,
and so in some cases the media can then

24
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:19,120
start a new narrative in the policy
debate,

25
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,560
a new frame.
Um,

26
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,980
but really you can think about
controlling media,

27
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,890
uh,
everything that goes on in an election,

28
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:28,390
everything that goes on in Washington
DC.

29
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,470
Fundamentally it comes down to first
controlling an attention,

30
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,700
how much attention in issue receives in
the press and then when it does receive

31
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:39,790
attention,
how's it defined or how is it framed?

32
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:43,820
Well,
I think,

33
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,750
I think the biggest challenge facing
science institutions today is the

34
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:50,590
problem of choice in the media system.
Uh,

35
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,710
so you can pray,
you can produce great scientific content

36
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,850
and produce really great science media
coverage of the New York Times coverage

37
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:01,970
on pbs.
But in most parts in those outlets,

38
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:05,120
you're probably only reaching an
audience who already agrees with you and

39
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:08,420
is already well informed.
The rest of the American public,

40
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:12,440
they have so many media choices that if
they lack of preference or interest in

41
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:14,780
science content,
they can completely avoid that really

42
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:17,960
good coverage.
So the challenge then is to try to

43
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:19,460
figure out,
in fact,

44
00:02:19,461 --> 00:02:23,810
ways to what I call incidentally,
expose that wider public,

45
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,790
the science content to get them science
information and places in the media

46
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,300
where they're not looking for it.
So sometimes that's in celebrity news

47
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:33,590
coverage.
Uh,

48
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,530
sometimes that that's at a religious new
site.

49
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,100
Sometimes that's in late night comedy,
like the daily show,

50
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,530
um,
infotainment entertainment,

51
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:45,620
sometimes that's on the business beat
because many people that read the

52
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:48,530
business pages are not interested in
science or not also recent reading the

53
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:49,250
science,
uh,

54
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,140
pages.
Uh,

55
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,400
but if you can get coverage of science,
the business beat,

56
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:53,900
now you're reaching an important
audience.

57
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,960
Um,
so you have to figure out a way that,

58
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,830
uh,
where can you accidentally reach your

59
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:01,930
audience,
incidentally reached the intended

60
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,030
audience that you're trying to reach.
And then second,

61
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,640
that's the channel.
And then you have to figure out,

62
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,250
okay,
what's the message that fits with that

63
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:11,800
channel,
with that area of the media and also the

64
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,680
audience that's consuming that media.
Uh,

65
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:15,790
and again,
that's where you,

66
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,740
that's where you do the research,
uh,

67
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,430
on how to frame a present that complex
information in a way that's

68
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:24,100
understandable,
assessable and connects to something

69
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:24,970
that people already know.
Right.
