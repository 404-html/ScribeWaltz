1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,240
The first thing to understand before 
looking at cars that drive themselves,

2
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:06,630
it's just how much of our lives cars 
have become,

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:09,120
especially in the United States,
but really all around the world.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,370
Um,
there are 33,000

5
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:13,350
Americans killed every year in car 
accidents,

6
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:16,050
more killed in car accidents in the 
United States.

7
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:20,430
Then in its entire history of war,
going back to the revolutionary war,

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,850
we have one point 2 million people 
killed around the world.

9
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:27,870
It's one of the world's major diseases.
If it were a disease in terms of killing

10
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:28,704
people,
and we also give 25 percent of all of 

11
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:33,294
our energy to personal transportation 
and 25 percent of our greenhouse gases 

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,400
are going to the car.
Now,

13
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:39,234
this is not true in Manhattan,
but in Los Angeles it's estimated that 

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,890
more than half of the land in the city 
belongs to the cars.

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,790
Garages,
it's driveways,

16
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,280
it's roads,
it's parking lots.

17
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,260
All of these things,
land that belongs to the car.

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,850
We have given up so much of ourselves 
and we depend on the car for so much.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,280
It shaped our cities that shaped our 
lives.

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,240
The fact that now cars are going to be a
computer thing,

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,360
that the computer is going to be the 
most important part of the car.

22
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:07,194
The thing that drives the car will be 
more important than the engine and this 

23
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:13,740
will be on the Moore's law curve.
We've talked about getting better,

24
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,600
not the engine getting better every 
year,

25
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:19,110
but the important part that drives it 
getting better every year.

26
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:21,540
The way computer technology,
network technology do.

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,953
We're going to rewrite really important 
elements of our society when we make 

28
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:29,330
transportation.
One of these computerized technologies,

29
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,263
so most people thought that cars drive 
themselves or something from science 

30
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:33,714
fiction.
I still routinely run into people who 

31
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:37,620
say this is not in my lifetime,
20 or 30 years away,

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,160
but this is clearly wrong and is 
becoming more and more clearly wrong.

33
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,003
As time goes on.
The most famous project and the most 

34
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:45,114
advanced project has come not from a car
company but from Google and I worked 

35
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:49,254
actually on Google's team for awhile and
building that vehicle so they have both 

36
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:53,604
logged about 700,000
miles of driving on ordinary city 

37
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:01,791
streets with their vehicles and they've 
now just released in May of 2014.

38
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,480
They have released a new vehicle that 
they're building from scratch,

39
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:08,730
designing from scratch which has no 
steering wheel in it,

40
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:09,923
no pedals.
You just get in and you've given it a 

41
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:13,194
destination probably on your phone and 
away it goes and takes you there and 

42
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:18,120
that's the real game changer when it 
comes out.

43
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,700
The car companies also are all working 
on efforts.

44
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:21,534
Every major car company has announced 
some sort of effort and Nissan and 

45
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,650
Mercedes and Volvo have all announced 
they'll be selling cars and about 20,

46
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:31,350
20 that look a little bit more like 
traditional cars,

47
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,693
but what Google's car does,
it's a vehicle that can run without 

48
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,700
steering wheel and nothing can run 
unmanned and that's where it gets really

49
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:39,534
interesting because a vehicle that can 
run on its own is a vehicle that can 

50
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:44,220
deliver itself to you.

51
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,443
It's a vehicle that can refuel or 
recharge itself without you having to 

52
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:49,224
worry about it and it's a vehicle that 
can store or what we used to call park 

53
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,813
itself,
although it may mostly function as a 

54
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:58,470
taxi and as a tax seed wouldn't even 
park at all.

55
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:01,330
It would just go pick up the next person
that has to pick up.

56
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,450
So today when people buy a car,
they go into the car dealership and they

57
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:09,100
look for a multipurpose car.
They ask,

58
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:12,970
what car do I need for my life?
Because they think,

59
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,390
well,
I ski twice a year so I need an SUV.

60
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,240
Or even though I live in the city,
I needed to ask you for you to get me up

61
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,240
to the mountains every so often or the 
number one selling car in America,

62
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,133
the Ford F 50 pickup truck,
which is not what most of those people 

63
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,004
need,
but we all go and buy at least a five 

64
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:31,990
passenger sedan,
a multipurpose car for all of our needs.

65
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,680
When you think of cars as fungible 
objects almost,

66
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:36,514
that can be delivered on demand because 
you pick up a cell phone and you asked 

67
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:39,844
her car to come to you.
Well suddenly you don't have to get a 

68
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:45,550
multipurpose guard.
You can get a car for that trip.

69
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,610
The car that you need today,
the car that you need right now,

70
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,270
that is a very different car from the 
cars we've made for the last century.

71
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:53,800
These big fat,
boxy things.

72
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,160
This is a car most of the time for one 
person because almost all your trips are

73
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:00,880
alone.
Sorry.

74
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,773
Unless you're a very friendly person.
They're alone and they're just short 

75
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:05,284
trips across town,
but we buy a car that's able to take 

76
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:08,254
five people,
hundreds of miles and that's very 

77
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,183
wasteful.
It's very energy inefficient and it 

78
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:16,690
takes a lot of space on the road too,
so if most trips come in,

79
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:17,524
little small electric vehicles in 
particular that are good enough for one 

80
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:25,561
person or two people face to face and 
they have a desk in them and a screen so

81
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:28,720
that you can work or watch videos and do
things and takes no time.

82
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,913
It's a very different vision of 
transportation and it's a much lower 

83
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:33,304
energy provision of transportation,
particularly as you enable electric 

84
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:38,380
vehicles.
Now today,

85
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,840
people don't buy electric vehicles that 
much.

86
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:42,230
They buy some,
certainly some,

87
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,240
some press being made about it,
but it's.

88
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:47,470
It's really a small portion of the car 
market and they are worried that the car

89
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:51,430
will run out of range or it'll take 
hours to recharge it when they're done.

90
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,160
They don't want to hassle with plugging 
it in,

91
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,610
but a robot doesn't care about any of 
those hassles and the robot doesn't care

92
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:58,444
about anything and because of that you 
can get a vehicle that is electric 

93
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:03,544
because you don't care about the range.
You don't care about the powertrain at 

94
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,004
all,
so very different from the way cars are 

95
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,074
sold today,
so we have lots of small efficient 

96
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:10,744
vehicles.
These vehicles are so efficient that 

97
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,930
they don't just beat out.

98
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,530
The cars were writing in now they beat 
up the trains and the buses.

99
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,350
Even in Manhattan,
even in Japan.

100
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:21,843
That's how efficient small,
lightweight electric vehicles can be at 

101
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:28,420
carrying people in terms of energy use 
to send a person a mile.

102
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,733
So this would mean that the United 
States would no longer have to import 

103
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:34,414
oil from overseas and you've probably 
seen there's a pesky habit that the US 

104
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,263
has.
They're going to war over the oil 

105
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:42,920
imports from overseas.
Be Very nice habit to be broken of.

106
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,230
It also means reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions by $200,

107
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:48,064
million tons.
It means getting rid of all the parking 

108
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:55,480
lots we have in our cities because if we
don't have to store vehicles in the same

109
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:56,314
way,
suddenly there's a bonanza in so many 

110
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:01,160
towns,
maybe not the dense downtown part,

111
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:01,994
but all of the surrounding territory 
where so much of that land is parking 

112
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:05,324
lots and for cars.

113
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,580
Suddenly we're going to turn some 
parking lots into park land.

114
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,553
That's going to be pretty nice.
We also have tricks to deal with 

115
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:13,400
congestion,
and that's pretty big.

116
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,103
If you invest in real estate,
you probably have heard a mantra that 

117
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,500
says the value of real estate is based 
on three important factors,

118
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:22,334
right?
It's an old joke.

119
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,390
Really?
Location,

120
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,433
location and location.
We're going to change what location 

121
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:31,520
means because transportation is really 
what locations about.

122
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:36,521
It's having a short trip by either on 
foot or on wheels or in transit or other

123
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:38,114
things to the things in your life that 
you need to get to in the shops and the 

124
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:41,504
people in the work.
The whole nature of retailing is going 

125
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:47,750
to change because we're also going to 
build delivery robots that never carry a

126
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:49,790
person and they're small and they're 
very,

127
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:53,540
very cheap and they can get you anything
in 30 minutes,

128
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,320
not just a pizza.

129
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,153
And now we do have a society that's the 
side of the pizza is the most important 

130
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,274
thing in the world.
You have to be able to get it in 30 

131
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:00,171
minutes,
no matter when,

132
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:02,570
no matter where you are,
but what,

133
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:05,510
if you can get anything cheaply in 30 
minutes,

134
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,910
what does that mean for shopping,
for retailing,

135
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,100
for how we use goods,
how we own goods.

136
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,450
It's going to change a lot more of our 
lives and people think to have cars that

137
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:15,284
are smart in this way.
A lot of people want to know when this 

138
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:19,200
is going to come out and uh,
uh,

139
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,440
you know,
I make jokes about naming a specific day

140
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,430
and time.
Uh,

141
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,830
so we've seen forecasts for many 
different companies.

142
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,080
Um,
Sergei Brin first said Google,

143
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:29,600
he thought would have cars and people's 
hands in 2017,

144
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,910
um,
widespread deployment.

145
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:32,744
Not then,
but what's happening in the later part 

146
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:39,260
of this decade and real deployment in 
the early part of the 20 slash 20 a,

147
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,350
the car companies that have said 20 20th
sort of their target year,

148
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:44,660
most of them have said that although 
tesla,

149
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:47,150
because Elon Musk,
the CEO of Tesla,

150
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:50,240
has the largest testicles of anyone in 
silicon valley.

151
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,440
He said,
I'm a,

152
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,350
he thinks he's going to have a car in 
2016.

153
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:55,184
We'll see if he delivers on that.
Volvo has also said they'll have cars 

154
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:02,060
running around their headquarters town 
in the hands of civilians in 2017.

155
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,223
So there's a lot of people willing to 
make predictions for really quick 

156
00:08:05,691 --> 00:08:06,800
delivery.
Now,

157
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,443
will they spread like wildfire,
like smartphones or will they spread 

158
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:13,760
like electric cars were really,
really slowly?

159
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,800
Well,
I'm betting on more like smartphones.

160
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:16,923
Um,
but that's not a bet that anyone can 

161
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:19,094
promise the answer to a.
we're not talking about vehicles that 

162
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:24,200
will be perfect.
It would be Hubris to suggest they could

163
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,450
be perfect.
There will be accidents,

164
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:27,284
there will be injuries,
and there could unfortunately even be 

165
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:29,894
fatalities.
And we do have a strong fear of being 

166
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:37,610
hurt by machines and good reason.
It's something to be afraid of,

167
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,030
but the social question is,
if you don't like being killed by robots

168
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:45,650
and you'd rather be killed by drums 
because that's what's happening today.

169
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,783
Forty percent of the fatalities on the 
roads here are a have drinking involved 

170
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:53,880
in them and robots for better or worse,
very rarely drink a.

171
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:55,830
they'll make mistakes,
but for different reasons.

172
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,510
And so as a society,
it's an interesting question,

173
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,290
something you're very scared of,
but which is actually safer on the grill

174
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,153
whole.
It's nobody's going to release this 

175
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:07,980
technology until they've got the 
evidence to themselves,

176
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,360
to their lawyers,
to the public,

177
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:12,160
that it's doing a better job than people
are at driving.

178
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,790
So you've got something that is better 
than people,

179
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,624
but it's more frightening.
And you could indeed see societies 

180
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,390
jumping back from that.
However,

181
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:23,610
whichever country decides to jump back 
on,

182
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,503
another country will jump in and there 
are many countries which can change 

183
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:27,744
their laws and their liabilities and 
their rules very quickly in a way that 

184
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:31,044
the United States may be can't.
And so there will be global competition 

185
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:37,950
to see who rules the new car industry 
and I really mean the car industry.

186
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,400
There is um,
our lesson that we teach over in silicon

187
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:42,234
valley about what's called disruptive 
technology and when we go through 

188
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:47,334
disruptive change and the technology,
it's very uncommon for the big players 

189
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:54,570
from the earlier generation to make it 
through to the new world.

190
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,420
And how many of you are using a Kodak 
Camera,

191
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:59,160
for example?
Not too many.

192
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:04,290
So I fear for the car companies because 
they will die.

193
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:08,520
Some of them as we move to this new 
world and the places where cars are made

194
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,361
may shaft,
you know,

195
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:10,194
Detroit has a big challenge in front of 
it and it's going to face against 

196
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:15,330
wherever the new industry comes from.
But Japan,

197
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,081
Korea,
Germany,

198
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:19,320
they also need to be afraid and they're 
the centers of car manufacturing today.

199
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,663
But politicians actually are aware of 
this and they're interested in seeing 

200
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:24,684
ways to,
to make sure that their economy becomes 

201
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:27,894
dominant in this world.
And that's why they've already passed 

202
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:32,720
laws in several states.
And then in other places around.

203
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:32,850
Yeah.
The

204
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,630
world to enable this technology rather 
than slowing down.
