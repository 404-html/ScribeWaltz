1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:01,903
Okay,

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,780
I think that's true.
Uh,

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,550
I think,
um,

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,920
the supreme court has a lot of
independent authority would just take

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,780
this term,
you know,

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,740
it may be that the city council of
Chicago,

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,000
of New York of La wants to ban handguns
in their city.

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,040
Well,
as of this year,

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,740
too bad supreme court says you can't do
it.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,480
You know that that is real power.
In one,

11
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,760
one of my favorite quotes about the
supreme court comes from Robert Jackson

12
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:41,300
who said,
we are not justice Robert Jackson who

13
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:44,780
said we are not final because we are
infallible.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,200
We are infallible because we are final.
Somebody has to have the last word and

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,190
in our country it's the supreme court.

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,250
I don't think I have a judicial
philosophy to speak of.

17
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:02,030
I,
I think I,

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,280
I,
I guess in my book,

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,840
in my analysis,
I am somewhat cynical,

20
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:12,490
realistic,
whatever you want to call it,

21
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:17,491
about the political nature of judging
when it comes to the constitution.

22
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,180
When you are addressing questions like,
does the constitution protect a woman's

23
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:29,221
right to choose abortion?
Does the constitution allow a,

24
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,710
a university to consider race in
admissions?

25
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:37,120
I don't think those questions have right
or wrong answers when it comes to

26
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,750
interpreting the constitution.
I think there are reasonable views on

27
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:44,500
both sides as a legal matter.
What I think is that there are

28
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:45,930
political,
the,

29
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,690
that,
that,

30
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,720
it depends what you think in terms of
your political philosophy.

31
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:54,721
I think political philosophy means more
than legal competence or expertise in

32
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,190
deciding to big constitutional issues.

33
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,250
Yeah,

34
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:05,763
mine.

35
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,063
Well,

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:11,831
I mean,
I,

37
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:16,831
I think there are.
I think there are terrific thinkers

38
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,160
about the court.
I like reading Cass Sunstein.

39
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:24,940
I like reading Larry tribe.
I like reading a Richard Posner.

40
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:29,170
I liked reading a Ronald Dworkin.
Um,

41
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,150
but you know,
this is not a moment where there are a

42
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:39,151
lot of judges out there who are legal
philosophers in the way that there have

43
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:42,670
been in the past.
There are people with distinctive

44
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:47,671
philosophies that they apply in
interesting and important ways,

45
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,860
but I don't think there are a lot of
geniuses in the way that there were.

46
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,350
There were when there was homes and
learn at hand.
