1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,061
Well of course,
you know,

2
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:09,570
China and the US have very different
ideas about intellectual property

3
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:10,404
lights,
right?

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,930
Um,
about copying and things like that.

5
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:15,450
Imitation,
I'm in a very foundationally,

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,690
things that in the u s are completely
taboo in China might be wrong or maybe

7
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:24,090
even not legal,
but they're not taboo.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,800
Right?
And you can ask yourself,

9
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:26,880
well,
why is that,

10
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:27,960
you know,
why is,

11
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,810
um,
is building a building that looks just

12
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:34,140
like a chateau in France?
You know,

13
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:36,570
why did we not do that here in the West?
We,

14
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:37,351
you know,
we might do it,

15
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:38,990
but it'd be an amusement park.
It would be something.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,290
Would you know that you did?
It was,

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,190
you know,
it's Tacky,

18
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:43,350
right?
So why do we think it's tacky?

19
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:46,740
Where in the east are considered?
I'm fine.

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,371
So,
you know,

21
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:48,204
you can have,
uh,

22
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,220
uh,
a very elaborate,

23
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,190
um,
copy of a,

24
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:53,610
of a French chateau.

25
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,120
Um,
you can pour $50 million into it.

26
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,210
You can use the exact stone that they
used in the original and,

27
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:01,531
and,
you know,

28
00:01:01,531 --> 00:01:03,420
and how this copy in every way.
Perfect.

29
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,510
And in China,
that's seen as a great thing,

30
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:07,470
right?
Like no one would say,

31
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:11,040
you're kidding.
You spend $50 million on this copy in

32
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,840
the u s we would never do that.
Right?

33
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,450
And why is that?
It's because we have two different

34
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,370
models of self.
Quite the contrary.

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,091
Um,
you know,

36
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:20,310
if it sees something which is great,
it's a small,

37
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:21,570
I'll do that too.
You know,

38
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:24,780
it's homage and this goes right down to
the educational level.

39
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,220
I mean,
so the idea,

40
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,171
you know,
in,

41
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,940
in our education,
we're very much trying to coax out of

42
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:31,020
people,
you know,

43
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:32,700
their unique vision.
Right?

44
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,020
Um,
it,

45
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:34,720
you know,
in Asia,

46
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,940
the idea that actually there are many
great ideas kind of help out there,

47
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:43,140
all around you in your culture and that
maybe before you think about how you can

48
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:47,040
put your own stamp on things,
maybe you should absorb those ideas.

49
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,570
Um,
it's very important.

50
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,310
So things that to us,
you know,

51
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,320
you just don't do,
you know,

52
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,310
to them it's like,
well,

53
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,630
why not?
You know,

54
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,780
they're much more playful attitude and
we'll say toward these things.

55
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,480
And so in order to absorb those ideas,
well,

56
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:02,850
how do you do that?
Often you irritate,

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,290
right?
So painters start,

58
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,240
they,
they find a great painter.

59
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,160
I'm a painter who with whom they feel
simpatico and they,

60
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,690
they copied those paintings and what
they,

61
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,840
what are they doing?
Know we think of copying,

62
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:18,180
we think of it's very kind of mechanical
process.

63
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,950
Um,
but actually they're trying to

64
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:22,650
internalize the greatness of this
painting.

65
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,900
So it's to them,
it's not,

66
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:28,050
it's not a mechanical process,
an organic process.

67
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,650
You know,
they're,

68
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,080
they're,
they're taking in this influence.

69
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,440
Ultimately they want to add to the great
tradition that they are signed up for.

70
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,210
And ultimately they want their,
their,

71
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,650
um,
contribution to be theirs.

72
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,010
And you know,
to be singular.

73
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,690
But they see that as coming after they
have master.

74
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,310
They're great tradition,
right?

75
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,580
And mastering it through imitation,
through memorization is completely fine.

76
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:57,840
And like I say,
it's a sign of Amash.

77
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,520
Now you can only imagine a culture where
there is this very longstanding

78
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,360
tradition of education through imitation
and through copying.

79
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,300
You can only imagine a co two to take
it,

80
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,810
a tradition like that.
And to sort of say this culture at,

81
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:15,400
well,
actually,

82
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,770
um,
every time you imitate something that's

83
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:20,080
actually taboo.
I mean,

84
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,680
they get it intellectually.
You can tell them,

85
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,640
but very foundationally,
that's not who they are.

86
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,660
And that's not,
you know,

87
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:32,200
these are not ideas that they have had.
It would be like telling us like every

88
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:34,720
time you pick up a spoon,
you know that that's when it's

89
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,770
copyrighted.
You know,

90
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,920
you really,
you really should pay a little fee every

91
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:40,670
time you use that spoon.
They would just think that will be,

92
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:42,250
that is really very strange.
Right.

93
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,590
Um,
so I think that,

94
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,170
um,
when we,

95
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,210
we look at these ideas,
we see a very big foundational split,

96
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,310
um,
between the two cultures.

97
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,250
Um,
and it,

98
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,710
you know,
I really,

99
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:57,130
copying is only one of the many areas
where you see,

100
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,130
um,
very divergent ideas.
