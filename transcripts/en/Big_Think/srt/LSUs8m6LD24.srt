1
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,530
Most psychologists agree.
The best way to have somebody increase

2
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:12,230
empathy is to engage in something called
perspective taking.

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,730
Imagining that you're someone else
trying to cognitively and emotionally

4
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:19,010
understand some event from their
perspective.

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,650
It's hard to do that.
Often.

6
00:00:21,651 --> 00:00:24,170
We don't have the facts,
meaning I don't know what's going on

7
00:00:24,171 --> 00:00:26,810
through your mind.
I don't have an experience of what it's

8
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:29,180
like to be you and it's also very
effortful.

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,570
It's hard to actually imagine what it's
like to be someone else and in fact,

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,930
when it comes to empathy,
we're often thinking about unpleasant

11
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:36,741
things.
For example,

12
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:39,290
what it's like to be homeless and the
brain doesn't want to go there.

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,190
So vr is a really neat tool because it
takes that cognitive effort out.

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,420
It makes increases accuracy so you're
not operating on stereotypes.

15
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:51,170
You may have in your mind what you can
actually experience the life of someone

16
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:53,060
else as as that person lives.

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,810
Since 2003 I've been running experiments
that take a person,

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,830
puts her in virtual reality and gives
her an experience that you couldn't have

19
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:05,090
in the real world.
This could be being in a different place

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,310
or could actually be becoming a
different person.

21
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,670
So the first study we ran was about
ageism and we took college age students

22
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,550
and they walked up to a virtual mirror.
And the reason we have a virtual mirror

23
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:21,140
is to show the person there they've
become different via a process called

24
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:24,380
body transfer.
This is a neuroscientific process where

25
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,850
if you move your physical body and you
have an Avatar that moves what's called

26
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:31,250
synchronously,
that beans at the same time that you

27
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:33,140
move your arm,
you see it's our move.

28
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:36,950
And you see that in a mirror as well on
the first person over time.

29
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:41,840
The part of the brain that contains the
Schema for the self expands and includes

30
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:44,060
this external representation as part of
the body.

31
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,080
So by using a virtual mirror and showing
somebody moving with a mirror,

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,360
you can literally feel like you've
become someone else.

33
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,850
You can be a different gender,
a different age,

34
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,830
uh,
you can become disabled,

35
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:56,780
you can have a,
a different skin color.

36
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,570
And our first study took college aged
students.

37
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,810
We had them become older,
about 60 to 70 years old.

38
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,290
We then network the second person into
virtual reality.

39
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,420
And there was a conversation between the
two.

40
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,380
Over time,
the conversation turned to stereotypical

41
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,070
concepts about being older.
So perhaps you didn't have a good memory

42
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:19,130
and the stereotypes were activated in
the conversation.

43
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:22,880
So while wearing the body of someone
else who's an older person,

44
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,550
I felt discrimination firsthand as a
subject.

45
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:30,050
And what we showed in that first study
published in 2005 was that subjects who

46
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:33,380
had gone through this treatment became
less ageist.

47
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,490
Uh,
when they came out.

48
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,590
For example,
if you ask them to list words about the

49
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:39,620
elderly,
they were less likely to list a words

50
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:42,830
that were stereotypical.
Since that first study,

51
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:47,150
we've run dozens of studies.
We've looked at empathy in terms of

52
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:49,700
becoming a different race,
becoming different gender,

53
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,250
even becoming a different specie.
If you become a cow,

54
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,080
how does that make you think about
animals?

55
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:57,440
And what our research has shown is vr is
not a magic tool.

56
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:59,320
It doesn't work every single time.
Uh,

57
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,430
but in general across all of our studies
of Vr tends to outperform control

58
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:04,540
conditions.
For example,

59
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,380
imagining you're someone else via role
playing or reading about case studies,

60
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:11,320
this experience of walking a mile in
someone's shoes,

61
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:16,330
it tends to be more effective at causing
empathy and behavior change towards

62
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:19,240
others.
At the 2018 tribeca film festival,

63
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,000
we're going to premiere a piece called
thousand cut journey.

64
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,960
I'm working with Courtney cogburn.
She's a professor at Columbia and she

65
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:28,300
studies implicit bias and black white
racism.

66
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,400
The piece is designed to show how people
of color do not experience racism once

67
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:34,550
or twice in their lives.
It's,

68
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:37,420
it's a process they go through pretty
much every day.

69
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,430
And so this piece is you start out as an
elementary school child and you're in a

70
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,780
classroom,
uh,

71
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,120
you then become a teenager,
uh,

72
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,460
and you're interacting with police
officers.

73
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,600
You then become an adult who's going on
a job interview and what you experienced

74
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:57,601
while wearing the body of a black male
is implicit bias that happens repeatedly

75
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,580
and over time.
And so that's a piece that's going to

76
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:02,740
premiere in April.
And what we're currently doing is

77
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:07,741
running experiments to test to see if it
changes attitudes and what aspects of

78
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:10,840
the experience are most effective at
changing those attitudes.
