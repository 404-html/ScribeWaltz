1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,740
Clearly the price of oil has had an
effect on the US economy,

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,610
but it hasn't been pronounced.
I think as many people feared.

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,990
Um,
I remember back in 2002 economists were

4
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:21,720
spreading over their possibility of 40
or $50 oil.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,720
Well now we're at a hundred dollar oil.
A lot of people don't like it,

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,360
but most of us can still afford it.
Now.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,070
It's definitely hurting a lot of people.
I'm not making light of that and it's

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,060
definitely a lot of people who drive a
lot truckers,

9
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:35,850
they're feeling a big pitch.
Um,

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,430
but oil at $120,
you know,

11
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:40,830
I don't know that it will be
substantially different from oil at 100.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,190
Um,
uh,

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,920
the price of gasoline is going up.
But,

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,761
uh,
you know,

15
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:47,460
there are a lot of other factors now
that are coming into the price of crude,

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,860
um,
besides demand.

17
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:52,470
And that is the falling value of the
dollar.

18
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:53,304
And,
um,

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,650
uh,
a lot of speculators in the market now

20
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:57,780
affecting the price of crude.
So you know,

21
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,050
how much they increased price,
we'll have what effect it will have.

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,940
You know,
I can't predict that.

23
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,750
Well I think that,
you know,

24
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,660
theory anyway,
the $5 a gallon price is one that people

25
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:17,590
often mention as one where huge amounts
of conservation people drive,

26
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:20,470
we'll quit driving,
they'll carpool or ride their bikes.

27
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,470
Um,
I think that that makes some sense.

28
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:25,060
But for myself,
um,

29
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,370
I live in Austin,
I often have to drive to Houston.

30
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,100
Uh,
if my choices are taking the bus or

31
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:34,030
flying or driving myself,
I'm still gonna probably buy $5 a gallon

32
00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:35,200
gasoline.
And I think that,

33
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,430
you know,
for,

34
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,260
as I recall about two thirds of the
transportation miles driven by

35
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:44,590
civilians,
non non commercial operators or people

36
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:48,610
driving to work.
So I think even at $5 a lot of people

37
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:50,590
are going to pay it because they have to
get to work.

38
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,510
So I think we haven't seen yet a price
high enough.

39
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:57,520
I think for,
uh,

40
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:03,330
a lot of societal changes overall in
terms of the end of the suburbs or so

41
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:04,540
on,
uh,

42
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,620
because,
uh,

43
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:10,710
we still see gasoline as a necessity.
And I think for many people that still

44
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:12,100
isn't,
will be for a long time to come.

45
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,030
Okay.
