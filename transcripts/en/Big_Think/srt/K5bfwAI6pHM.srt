1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:03,823
Well,
um,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,830
my recent visit to Congo to the eastern
parts that is the north and South Kivu

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,410
revealed that there is still a rather
unstable situation,

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,180
uh,
in the east.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,300
And um,
this was a followup to the atrocities in

6
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:28,050
the valley color territory.
I'm late August,

7
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:31,080
beginning of September,
and um,

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,470
I withdraw the worried to visit some of
these villages because I'm still.

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,770
People are traumatized and I'm in a kind
of,

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,660
in a state of shock,
I would say,

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,280
uh,
not only that,

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,310
but they fear that their attackers might
come back or even that the deployment of

13
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:57,650
a government troops in this area might
mean that they also have to live off the

14
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:01,500
population.
They are deployed there without enough

15
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:03,030
to eat,
without pay,

16
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:08,031
without a barracks.
So it means that they are afraid that

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,450
they will have to,
that they will start to loot and pillage

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,040
this,
these villages as,

19
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:14,550
as well.

20
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,700
And then we can assume rape.
Unfortunately,

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,440
this is actually a,
an area where a close to the mining

22
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,240
mining activities.
So the BCA,

23
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:32,340
a mining district.
So it means that,

24
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:35,400
uh,
some of the men from this small villages

25
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:40,401
probably work in the,
in the mining business or to support the

26
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:44,640
mining business,
but very often these small minds or

27
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:49,080
controlled by rebel groups or sometimes,
uh,

28
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,100
by,
by government troops as,

29
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:54,740
as well.
And um,

30
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,170
it means that it's a very sort of unsafe
situation for,

31
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,260
for civilians.
And uh,

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,250
unfortunately this is something that
fuels the,

33
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,250
the ongoing conflict and some of the
rebels.

34
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,610
So it leaves the civil population very
exposed and under a kind of constant

35
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:18,924
stress.

36
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,810
Well,
everybody said the same thing.

37
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:29,550
They want peace and they hope that piece
will bring peace also to the women.

38
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,220
Um,
this is not,

39
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,170
we cannot be sure that it brings peace
to the women because when this is done

40
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:41,640
at the scale that we saw in the editor,
oratory and in these villages,

41
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,000
uh,
unfortunately it brutalizes the whole

42
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:48,540
society.
It's been sober on the civil society.

43
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,360
And that means,
um,

44
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,630
you know,
a new generation of young men and boys

45
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:56,980
will also think that,
that this is a,

46
00:02:56,981 --> 00:03:01,981
a natural thing.
And women don't feel that they have that

47
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:06,550
they are valued that they.
And one young woman said to us that she.

48
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,180
Her impression was that she was of
course very distraught,

49
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:14,200
but she said,
I a dead rat is worth more than the body

50
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,850
of a woman.
And,

51
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,620
and I think this just shows that at the
moment the women who are very much the

52
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:25,621
backbone of the economy of the DRC
are just sort of not valued.

53
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:29,740
They are,
they are broken.

54
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,540
And that means also it will be so much
more difficult to build peace and any

55
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,390
kind of economic development in the DRC.
