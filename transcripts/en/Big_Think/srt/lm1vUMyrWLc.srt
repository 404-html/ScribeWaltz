1
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:05,791
You know,
I,

2
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:06,530
I,
uh,

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,410
when I was at the paper,
uh,

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,250
I would let my assistant,
Arthur Bovino very good journalists,

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,550
uh,
he and I would,

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,680
we had a game,
we would both read the paper before we

7
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:19,310
came to work and we would bet on what
was the mail going to be about,

8
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:20,660
what were people going to be complaining
about.

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,150
And of course,
within a couple of months we knew

10
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:24,860
exactly what people would be complaining
about.

11
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:28,610
We learned how the average times reader
or not even the average time sort of the

12
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,430
times readers in general responded to
the newspaper.

13
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,880
So I began to respond that way and I
would see things that would irritate me

14
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:37,400
that I might not have noticed at an
earlier time.

15
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,980
I tried to stop doing that when I left
the paper.

16
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:44,630
And I've been pretty good about it.
The only time that I really wanted to go

17
00:00:44,631 --> 00:00:47,600
and grab somebody around the neck was
the Duke Lacrosse case.

18
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,810
And I'm happy to save it.
I'm proud to say I gave a speech to the

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,110
journalists,
journalism fellows at Harvard,

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,750
um,
while that was breaking barriers within

21
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:00,770
the first month.
And I said,

22
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,850
this is going to be a catastrophe.
This journalism is not good journalism

23
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,380
and this is something where a story is
being blown up to much larger scale than

24
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:13,130
it deserves to be because it fits so
many preconceptions of so many of the

25
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:15,410
editors at the Times.
Uh,

26
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:17,090
you know,
it was white over black,

27
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:19,490
it was rich over pour,
it was educated over an educated,

28
00:01:19,491 --> 00:01:21,020
it was male over female.
Aha,

29
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,050
let's go do something about this.
And uh,

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,110
because the times did it,
that led to everybody else doing it.

31
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,920
So Newsweek does a cover story that
never would've happened had not,

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,260
the times has been putting it on the
front page for several days.

33
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:36,200
So that was driving me crazy.
On the other hand,

34
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:38,210
it wasn't my job any longer to be the
cop.

35
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:39,830
So I left that to my successor.

36
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,620
Well,
the biggest problems confronting the

37
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:46,270
time,
specifically we at the same problems as

38
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:49,000
providing it,
confronting everybody in the news

39
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:50,740
business,
which is that people don't seem to be

40
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,280
willing to pay for their news or let me
turn that around.

41
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,940
I think the times it seems very
reluctant to charge people for the news,

42
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,340
although they have announced that
they're going to begin charging,

43
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,270
uh,
online,

44
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,520
um,
in early 2011.

45
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,250
Uh,
I still sense of trepidation and I wish

46
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,050
it were otherwise.
I wish they had more confidence.

47
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:11,590
I think that it may be hard for this
regional paper,

48
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,040
that metropolitan paper or the small
town paper to charge for news,

49
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,640
but I think the times can get away with
it because it is the,

50
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,670
for a large portion of the educated
populace,

51
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,170
it is the authoritative voice on what's
happening in the world.

52
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,550
Um,
you know,

53
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:29,650
there are something like,
I don't know how many tens of,

54
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,110
I think it's now over 10 million people.

55
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,750
Let me restate that.
You know,

56
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,090
there are millions of people who go to
that website every day,

57
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:40,510
all over the world.
Now if you started charging $10 a month,

58
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:41,830
would a lot of them stop?
Yes.

59
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,050
Would all of them stop note would 50%
stop?

60
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,690
I don't know.
But I did the math not long ago and I

61
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:49,900
think that if 20% of them stayed,
that would cover the cost of the

62
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:54,901
newsroom and what the people in the news
business seem reluctant to realize is

63
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,730
that's the only thing that matters,
that that it's the production of news

64
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,210
being rewarded with revenue to cover the
costs and perhaps produce a profit.

65
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,380
That's what counts.
The making of a newspaper isn't what

66
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:10,000
counts.
And I think you know,

67
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,331
if,
if,

68
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:12,070
if,
if somebody had gone to the newspaper

69
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:15,400
Publishers and magazine Publishers of
America 20 years ago and said,

70
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,780
I have a new business model for you.

71
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,090
No paper,
no ink,

72
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,670
no trucks,
no teamsters,

73
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:23,560
no pressman,
no printer's Union,

74
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,840
no newsstands.
They'd say,

75
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:28,060
give it to me tomorrow.
This is heaven.

76
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,340
We just want to put our words and
pictures out there.

77
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,750
But they were so intent on protecting
the current revenue stream.

78
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,200
The money that advertisers pay and the
money that individuals pay for the

79
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,090
paper,
that they didn't see that this was a

80
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:44,200
boon for them and they made the same
mistake that the music business made in

81
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:46,510
the music business,
lost control of their industry.

82
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:48,070
They lost control of it,
the Steve Jobs,

83
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,910
because they want it to continue to sell
cds for $15 each.

84
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,610
And I think that the same thing's
happening in the print business.

85
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:56,560
I'm glad to see that the times is
moving,

86
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,890
and I think once the times moves,
many other institutions will move as

87
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:03,160
well.
Charge people for your product if

88
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:05,320
they're not willing to pay for it,
maybe you've got a problem with your

89
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:06,154
product.

90
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,060
Yeah.
