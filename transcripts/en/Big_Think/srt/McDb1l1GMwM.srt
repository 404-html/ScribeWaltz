1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,910
Yes,
I think there are elements of the game

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,300
that you should teach in terms of like
teaching because what poker really does

3
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:17,180
is teach you how to deal with
probabilities and uncertainties.

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,890
And that's so integral to life,
you know,

5
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:21,770
with everything,
everything we tried to do,

6
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,810
you know,
should we take this route or that route?

7
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:26,180
Should I go here on vacation?
Or they're,

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,260
it's all about dealing with w with
uncertainties and probabilities of

9
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:34,730
things happening and,
and poker is a very fun and easy way to

10
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:36,710
teach someone how to do that.
Um,

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,760
it's a shame.
People often put poker in the same

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,130
ballpark as,
as just general gambling.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,370
Um,
just because some people choose to play

14
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:48,200
it for money,
but you don't have to play it for money.

15
00:00:48,201 --> 00:00:51,050
It's just about about winning.
You can win anything.

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,320
He can win prizes,
you can win match six or money.

17
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,700
Um,
and that there are so many like core

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,440
fundamentals of the game that I wish I
have no age,

19
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,000
age 10.
The these idea that these sort of ways

20
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:12,320
of thinking about expectation,
expected value and um,

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,810
what probabilistic thinking in general,
that would have sped up a lot of things

22
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,200
in my life had I been more aware of it.
And also learning how to evaluate

23
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:22,790
evidence.
Um,

24
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,270
that's something that is not taught in
school.

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,820
Very rarely taught in school.
Learning how to change our minds,

26
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:30,510
update our beliefs,
uh,

27
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,330
look at,
you know,

28
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,150
when we get new information,
being able to wait is that inflammation

29
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:37,940
or reliable or not?
And playing poker has taught me how to

30
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:40,160
do those much more accurately.
Um,

31
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:42,290
so if,
if,

32
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,610
if there's a way to teach children's for
a game and children love to learn

33
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:49,340
through games,
poker could be that one of those

34
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:50,174
methods.

35
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,990
I think something like being
mathematically minded is,

36
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,460
I mean,
yeah,

37
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,220
there's probably some aptitude involved
in it.

38
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,740
Um,
but I still think it's,

39
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,600
the vast majority of it is down to
determination and practice.

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,700
Uh,
you can take someone,

41
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,120
I mean,
if you can just understand the concept

42
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:16,460
of numbers in the first place,
which I think the vast majority of

43
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:19,880
humans can,
then you can train someone to be more

44
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:22,070
mathematically capable.
It's like learning a language.

45
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:23,090
You know,
you start off,

46
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,900
as long as you have that initial passion
and desire to get better,

47
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,900
then there's those little incremental
jumps.

48
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:34,100
And it makes me so sad when I meet
people who are like,

49
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,450
oh,
I'm no good at math and I'm good at

50
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:37,400
math.
And if you actually keep asking them why

51
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:40,760
and go back in their history,
it almost always comes down to some bad

52
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:43,070
experience they had when they were
probably seven years old.

53
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,790
And the teacher asked them,
you know,

54
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,960
what's five times five?
And they screwed up and their friends

55
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:50,030
laughed at them and then they just,
you know,

56
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:51,470
these barriers get built and they're
like,

57
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,640
oh,
that's not my thing.

58
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,110
Um,
and I think that's just a huge tragedy

59
00:02:57,111 --> 00:03:02,111
because most humans can learn,
be at least competent at,

60
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,950
at basic mathematics,
especially the mathematics in involved

61
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:08,890
in poker.
It's really not that complicated.

62
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,350
Um,
there's a lot of approximations you can

63
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:12,720
do.
And I,

64
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,810
I found that I used to actually not be
very good at mental arithmetic.

65
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,390
Um,
I'm fine if I had a pen and paper and

66
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,790
Algebra that was,
I liked that,

67
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,020
but in the moments,
men's,

68
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,550
mental arithmetic,
I could never do.

69
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:27,910
But I started playing poker inside of
just practicing these things.

70
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:31,660
And now I,
it's a skill I'm proud of.

71
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,350
So it's,
it's,

72
00:03:34,351 --> 00:03:37,510
it's just a willingness to,
to keep plugging away at it.
