1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,550
such a hard question.
Who would I go to dinner with?

3
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,760
I don't want to pick a feminist because
maybe I could probably like figuring out

4
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:21,530
a way to get like dinner with a
feminist.

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,853
Um,

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:25,893
oh my God,

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,960
this is going to sound kind of twisted.
But I think Raymond Carver,

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,130
the writer who I love and is kind of
like a,

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,790
you know,
it was an alcoholic and not like

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,610
necessarily a very good person,
but I just have always really loved his

11
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:43,560
short stories and I would just love to
pick his brain.
