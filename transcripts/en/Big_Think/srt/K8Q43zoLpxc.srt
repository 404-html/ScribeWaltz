1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,240
I smiled because I'm probably the only
one running for president who took an

2
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:19,740
issue to the democratic platform
personally and ask them to act on it.

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,880
And let me tell you what the issue was.
Healthcare in 2000

4
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,920
I took this proposal for a not for
profit healthcare system,

5
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:31,650
medicare for ah,
to the Democratic Platform Committee.

6
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,660
I was asked by the campaign,
the presidential candidate to withdraw

7
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:41,280
the proposal because it was,
it was not favored by the insurance

8
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:43,950
interest who were contributing mightily
to the Democratic Party.

9
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,010
And,
and virtually the same thing happened in

10
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:51,630
2004 so here's the Democratic Party.
These candidates are saying universal

11
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:53,280
healthcare,
like it's some kind of mantra,

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,030
universal healthcare,
universal healthcare.

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,040
And then people go,
oh,

14
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,930
they're for me.
They're going to give me a universal

15
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:03,930
healthcare.
The insurance companies want universal

16
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:07,710
healthcare as long as the government is
subsidizing them so they can maintain

17
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:10,200
theirs.
They're holding their privilege profit

18
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:14,070
position.
I'm talking about no more healthcare for

19
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:17,550
profit.
Everyone knows these insurance companies

20
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:20,250
make money not providing health care.
Everyone knows it.

21
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,890
So I'm saying no more for profit
healthcare,

22
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,310
not for profit system.
All the money goes into care for people.

23
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,270
And then you have enough money,
not only for basic care but for vision

24
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:31,500
care,
dental care,

25
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:33,420
mental health care,
longterm care,

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,550
prescription drugs,
all covered 100% under the cassette,

27
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:42,720
which program the Democrats new.
They want to protect the insurance

28
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:43,554
company.

29
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,650
I don't know that,
uh,

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,550
that I accept much of the platform of
either party,

31
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:56,150
but I will tell you this,
that I work with Republicans in Congress

32
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,550
who stands for protecting the
constitution were absolutely opposed to

33
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:06,551
the Patriot Act who believe that wire
tapping eavesdropping is an undermining

34
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,340
of constitutional protections to be free
from your person for unreasonable search

35
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,310
searches and seizures who believe that,
um,

36
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,150
uh,
that,

37
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,610
that government functions best when it
stays out of people private lives.

38
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,480
So that aspect,
which seems to go more towards,

39
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,070
you know,
what Republicans think,

40
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,260
the things that,
that I support.

41
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,480
And I,
and I also think that,

42
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,730
uh,
that this idea of,

43
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,820
of,
of Democrats and Republicans a good idea

44
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:41,780
as long as there's a real debate,
but when the debate becomes blurred

45
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:45,440
because you have corporate interest
contributing two Democrats and two

46
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:49,340
Republicans,
then you have the American people being

47
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:53,300
deserved than people in those parties
maintained their privileged position.

48
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:55,820
Well,
the economic status of their

49
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:57,260
constituents begins to erode.
