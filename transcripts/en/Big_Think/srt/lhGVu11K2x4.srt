1
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,720
Well,
like most people that don't live on the

2
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:13,910
south side of Chicago or in Illinois,
they're really.

3
00:00:13,911 --> 00:00:18,860
The first time that I ever heard of him
was when he was running for Senate and

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,890
we were looking at the New Yorker for
interesting Senate,

5
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:24,680
Congressional and State House races to
write about in addition to the

6
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:27,830
presidential race,
and somebody mentioned this guy,

7
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:32,831
Barack Obama,
that he was interesting and he was quite

8
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:37,991
possibly going to win and it was a state
world kinds of bizarre things were

9
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:43,301
happening in that Senate race.
Remember the first real great event was

10
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:48,440
his big democratic opponent.
Blair hall disappeared from the race

11
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:53,441
because his divorce records were opened
up and that wasn't an edifying spectacle

12
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:57,410
at all.
And then of course there's this big

13
00:00:57,411 --> 00:01:01,010
speech.
So Obama comes on the scene in 2004,

14
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:05,000
unless you're a real Illinois political
nuts and you know,

15
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,300
he gave that speech.
I went to the Boston convention in the

16
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:12,050
summer of 2004 and he was pretty damn
good.

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,920
He was even better on television.
He had really learned that,

18
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:21,030
that fine art of giving a speech to a
big crowd and yet not over projecting so

19
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:24,350
that it would come off as shouting on
television.

20
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:27,020
So he was really developing these
talents.

21
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,640
Um,
2004,

22
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,580
but I gotta tell Ya,
there's no way in the world I thought he

23
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:33,680
would be a presidential candidate in
2008,

24
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:34,970
much less a successful one.

25
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,940
Well,
we wanted to put out an issue of the New

26
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,730
Yorker just after the election was
pretty clear that Obama was going to win

27
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,920
and they were going to be four or five
big pieces.

28
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:47,570
David Grann,
Ryan Lizza,

29
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,900
um,
were among the riders in that issue.

30
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,700
I want it to write about race.
And I'd written a fair amount about race

31
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:59,390
in my time as a journalist.
And Ryan was interested in other things.

32
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:04,391
Grand was going to write about Mccain
and I'd written a biography of Muhammad

33
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,750
Ali.
I knew my way around,

34
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,980
a little bit on the south side of
Chicago because that was part of the Ali

35
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,910
geography and politics.
And I sort of took that on and I was

36
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:18,911
intrigued by the speech that Obama gave
in March 2007 just after he announced

37
00:02:19,911 --> 00:02:24,911
for the presidency at in Selma,
Alabama at the commemoration of the

38
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:25,700
great,
you know,

39
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,730
bloody Sunday events in the march from
Selma to Montgomery.

40
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,000
And he declared,
first of all,

41
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:34,910
he gave his great thanks to what he
called the Moses Generation,

42
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:37,370
the Moses generation being the civil
rights generation,

43
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,530
the generation that gave so much
opportunity to people that were coming

44
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:47,240
down the line that succeeded on the
civil rights act,

45
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:51,560
on voting rights,
on breaking open access to institutions

46
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,670
like institutions of higher learning
that Obama benefited from after all,

47
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:57,560
he went to nothing but elite
institutions,

48
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,390
Pentaho's school,
Occidental,

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,080
Columbia,
Harvard law school.

50
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,770
This would not have been possible
without the Moses generation.

51
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:07,780
And even that went,
which went for it.

52
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,730
And then he declares himself the head of
the Joshua Generation,

53
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,680
his generation,
people in their thirties,

54
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:15,670
forties,
fifties,

55
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,850
who benefited from these elders.
And he does this incredibly a ballsy

56
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:22,630
thing.
He says,

57
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:26,830
I'm the leader of the Joshua Generation.
And he goes right after the African

58
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,220
American vote,
because if you remember Hillary Clinton,

59
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:33,400
the Clintons thought that they had a
pretty good purchase on the African

60
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,570
American vote because of their,
um,

61
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,030
long associations and Obama was
challenging that.

62
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,980
Well,
first of all,

63
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:47,710
in order to get the Democratic
nomination for the presidency,

64
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,990
the African American vote is a very big
deal.

65
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,840
You have to pursue that vote and you
pursue it hard,

66
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,990
not Iowa of course,
where there aren't very many,

67
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,010
but elsewhere down the line,
Obama could not assume that vote was

68
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:03,130
his.
Remember who knew who Barack Obama was

69
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:05,140
at that point.
Very few people,

70
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:07,870
really insiders,
people who had watched one speech from

71
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:11,110
some time ago,
he had to really pursue it.

72
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,020
The Clintons didn't assume that they
would win it,

73
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,390
but they had a real historical purchase
on it.

74
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,920
They had associations with certainly
with lots and lots of black leaders from

75
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:21,850
around the country.
After all,

76
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:25,420
he had been president for eight years.
They had done a lot of time in black

77
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:30,070
churches and black groups and there was
a real relationship there.

78
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:33,790
There were a lot of loyalties and a lot
of members of the civil rights

79
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,230
generation,
uh,

80
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,300
and people of that generation in media
and in show business and in business,

81
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:44,890
people who are going to be donating
money had long associations with the

82
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:45,843
Clintons.

83
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,980
Um,
somebody like Vernon Jordan,

84
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,200
people who ran bet,
so obama couldn't just jump in and by

85
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:56,890
dint of is being African American
assumed he was going to get that vote.

86
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:59,890
He had to go out and win it.
He goes to Iowa,

87
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,730
which is a white state,
and he won the Iowa caucuses running on

88
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:08,920
the kind of appeal that you had seen in
previous years.

89
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:10,540
Like Gary Hart.
In other words,

90
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,360
he was appealing to kind of well
educated,

91
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,480
liberal leaning whites,
party regulars,

92
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:19,680
and they came out in droves from him
because of the level of associate of

93
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,160
organization in the state.
He wins the Iowa primary and that starts

94
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:28,180
to give people around the country ideas.
Suddenly he's on a much more equal

95
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:32,770
footing with Hillary Clinton.
And so black folks in places like South

96
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,720
Carolina,
which is a crucial primary state,

97
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,393
said,
ah,

98
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,380
I see.
And that,

99
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,260
you know,
there was a chain reaction occurs now

100
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,950
that's not to say that black people
voted for Barack Obama and South

101
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,080
Carolina because they had some kind of
permission from white people,

102
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,120
but black folks didn't want to be voting
for a symbolic candidate that had

103
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:55,510
happened before.
They'd been many symbolic candidates.

104
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:57,920
And there are even been Jesse Jackson in
84 and 88.

105
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,740
There is no Barack Obama,
by the way,

106
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,040
without Jesse Jackson.
Jesse Jackson role is false.

107
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:09,041
Did an enormous historical good by
breaking down the barriers toward the

108
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,610
political imagination of having a
successful African American presidential

109
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:16,754
candidate.

110
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,930
Well,
it's,

111
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,980
it's worthwhile to kind of fact check
the strangeness of Barack Obama's

112
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:29,360
Beginnings in,
in,

113
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,390
in racial,
ethnic,

114
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:33,980
and identity terms.
He grows up with the exception of a

115
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,360
sojourn in Indonesia,
in Hawaii.

116
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,400
And if you've ever been to Hawaii,
first of all,

117
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:39,570
this,
this feeling of great,

118
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,300
almost isolation in the middle of the
Pacific Ocean.

119
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,110
And it's a place that prides itself on,
um,

120
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,860
on variation on,
on a multiculturalism.

121
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,580
People using that word long before it
was fashionable on the,

122
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:54,540
uh,
on the mainland.

123
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,680
And yet it's a multiculturalism lacking
one very striking thing in American

124
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:02,370
terms,
black folks and most of the black

125
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:05,390
population in Hawaii,
the little that there is,

126
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,720
is on military basis and Obama goes to
one of the fanciest schools in the

127
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:13,500
country of this,
this private school called [inaudible]

128
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,580
Ho in Honolulu,
which looks like Exeter or andover,

129
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:19,440
if you imagined it right near the beach.

130
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,410
Lockers outside,
people walking around in this shoe.

131
00:07:22,411 --> 00:07:24,120
I mean,
it's just fantastically.

132
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:27,360
It looks like it looks like a highschool
created by,

133
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,370
you know,
a Netflix of cello or something,

134
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:31,620
you know,
a beach fantasy of what high school

135
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:34,710
could be.
And he goes there and it's diverse in

136
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:37,380
some sense.
There's lots of Asian kids of all kinds.

137
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,980
Um,
all the various stripes that you see in

138
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:42,960
Hawaii,
but just a couple of black kids.

139
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,160
And when he goes home at night,
it's two white grandparents.

140
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,000
So how does he learn how to be what he
sees in the mirror.

141
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,720
He pursues it by watching things on
television,

142
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:57,330
listening to certain records,
reading certain books.

143
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,810
He goes out and assertively goes after
it and he does it then geographically by

144
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:06,120
going to Los Angeles,
but he's kind of in Pasadena and that's

145
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:08,190
not good enough for him.
He goes to Columbia,

146
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,820
which is of course close to Harlem and
finally ones up on the south side of

147
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:16,821
Chicago and there he's finally able to
find community community,

148
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,620
a sense of purpose,
a sense of idealism,

149
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,770
a church black church specifically,
and he really begins to solve these

150
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,470
identity questions there.

151
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,360
By the time he gets to Harvard law
school,

152
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,710
these things are resolved for him,
but when you go into public life,

153
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:37,890
it's a question of how people see you.
So he's got to struggle with these

154
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:40,980
questions all over again.
When he does things like run for

155
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:42,510
Congress or for state senate.
