1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,390
So every profession has a code of 
ethics.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,380
Doctors have a code of ethics.
The hippocratic oath,

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,750
lawyers,
accountants,

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,730
journalists.
Uh,

5
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:12,564
in fact,
part of a profession is that there is a 

6
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:15,294
code of ethics and museums and museum 
directors have an association and the 

7
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:23,340
code and that code says among other 
things,

8
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:24,174
that you can't sell a work of art from 
your collection and use that money to 

9
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:32,460
use to do something else with it.
So for example,

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,653
right now the Detroit Institute of art 
is battling the city because the city 

11
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:41,340
wants to sell the art so that it can pay
pensions.

12
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,200
How does the director defend himself?
How does,

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,800
how does he make a case for this not to 
happen?

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,970
And Who protects him along with his 
board?

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,820
And that's where a code of ethics comes 
in.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,830
Code of ethics that is developed,
worked on by a group of professionals,

17
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:03,060
changes over time.

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,330
So now we turn to the performing arts.
And for me,

19
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:07,164
it was a big surprise.
It was a shock actually to hear and to 

20
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:11,244
think about the fact that there really 
isn't a code of ethics for the 

21
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:15,610
performing arts.
Uh,

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,240
of course,
I did some research just to make sure,

23
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,290
let me give you an example,
and this is a mundane example,

24
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:22,980
but,
uh,

25
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,370
being a former pianist,
it struck me,

26
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,930
and that is,
uh,

27
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,460
I was at a concert and a string quartet 
was playing a Schubert Quartet.

28
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,540
And in the fourth movement,
the first violin is turned to the second

29
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:37,374
violinist and gave a kind of a nod and 
the second violinist gave a kind of a 

30
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:43,110
nod to the cellist.
You get the idea.

31
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,300
And I was thinking to myself,
what are they doing?

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,793
I couldn't figure it out.
So they played the piece and what they 

33
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:55,110
did or what they didn't do was they 
didn't play the repeat of the first part

34
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:56,430
of this Schubert Quartet.

35
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,100
Now,
the general audience,

36
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,490
they probably didn't know as a,
as a musician,

37
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:05,040
I knew,
is it a big deal?

38
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,160
It's not what Schubert intended.
Uh,

39
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,023
so is there some reason,
is there something that we can use to 

40
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:18,900
guide to help us understand what's right
and what's not?

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,333
Okay.
That's a mundane example in lots of 

42
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:25,980
people break that or bruits.
So code of ethics about playing repeats.

43
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,690
When I play the piano now of course I 
play all the repeats that are necessary.

44
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,600
Uh,
take that a little further though,

45
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,643
uh,
into the realm of what does a producer 

46
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,830
do when thinking about what can be and 
what can't be done.

47
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,120
Uh,
a couple of years ago,

48
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:45,954
Diane Paulus,
who's a wonderful director and producer 

49
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:51,570
in Boston,
did a version of porgy and bess,

50
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,060
you know,
one of the classic American operas.

51
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,890
Everybody knows porgy and bess and some 
of it is sad and some of it is,

52
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,970
you know,
to some people a little boring.

53
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,483
Uh,
and Diane Paulus decided to do a 

54
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:07,660
completely different version of porgy 
and bess.

55
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,880
She decided to,
uh,

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,060
make it more modern,
which is fine.

57
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,440
She decided to change the ending,
which is questionable.

58
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,800
She decided to change some of the music.
Now,

59
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,000
you know,
I'm a purist.

60
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,890
This really bothered me,
of course.

61
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,850
So the question is,
can Diane Paulus do that?

62
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:31,540
Of course she can do it,
but can she call it porgy and bess?

63
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,060
It's now it played on Broadway for a 
season as a cast recording.

64
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,013
And in the future,
will there be an understanding by a 

65
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:45,250
generation who thinks that this is what 
porgy and bess is?

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,833
Okay.
So I don't want to be pedantic about 

67
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:50,314
this but,
but my point is that over and over 

68
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:53,824
again,
there are questions that every 

69
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,714
profession has that the members of the 
profession have not discussed to say 

70
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:04,750
what's right,
what's wrong and argue about sure.

71
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,020
But there's no basis,
there's no moral basis.

72
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,490
It gets a little more complicated.
There was a production in Berlin,

73
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:17,491
in Berlin Opera House of a Mozart opera 
called in dominium and this producer,

74
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,780
opera director in Berlin and in Berlin,
you know,

75
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:25,360
they do kind of outlandish kinds of 
opera,

76
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,050
decided to do a very outlandish 
production in which among other things,

77
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,590
Mohammed was inserted into the opera.
It wasn't in the opera and uh,

78
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,820
took the place of another character.
And for some people,

79
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:47,260
for some Muslims it seemed like a 
sacrilegious thing to do and there was a

80
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:49,660
big protest.
The question is,

81
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,063
does the head of the opera company say 
the director has the right and the 

82
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:58,114
ethical right to do what he thinks is 
right or does that person give into 

83
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,610
public appeal?
So the answer is who knows?

84
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,663
And the answer is also we don't know 
because there isn't this kind of set 

85
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,104
rule.

86
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,440
If a doctor is faced with an ethical 
choice,

87
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,753
they turned to their code of ethics.
If a museum director is faced with an 

88
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:25,900
ethical choice,
they turn to a code of ethics.

89
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,483
If a performing arts director or a 
string quartet leader or a producer on 

90
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:37,741
Broadway is faced with what might be 
considered by some an ethical choice,

91
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,440
they have nothing to fall back on,
so to speak.

92
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,360
What we need are a group of 
professionals who are in the theater who

93
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:47,194
can at least discuss it,
who can set the beginnings of a 

94
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:54,430
fundamental of unethical decision or 
ethical philosophy.
