1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,000
I think we have tremendous,
tremendous growth,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,890
tremendous,
tremendous potential in exploring the

3
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:11,850
frontier of human beings.
We are at just at the very,

4
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:16,851
very beginning of a very exciting
adventure and think of of diseases as

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,730
common cold,
right?

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,100
But it's nothing terribly unusual about
common called right,

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,170
yet we don't have a cure for common cold
yet,

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,000
which is kind of ironic,
right?

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,880
Uh,
which means that innovation could be

10
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:40,881
very small for small things like common
cold or big things like Alzheimer's and

11
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:43,050
diabetes.
We have multiple products for the

12
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:47,610
diabetes today.
We don't have acute for diabetes yet.

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,430
Actually,
if you add Alzheimer's and diabetes,

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,610
it could bankrupt our health care system
yet we don't have a cure for diabetes

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,700
and we don't know how to deal with
Alzheimer's yet.

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,700
So if I look at the future,
a couple of things will happen.

17
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:06,060
One,
we have phenomenal tools that will

18
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:11,061
enable us to diagnose and to be more
specific in better understanding the

19
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:14,010
mechanism of virtually any disease.

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,520
And the second aspect would be based on
that we can start now charter the,

21
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,460
the road to veteran understanding the
brain.

22
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,550
We don't know much about the brain,
we know a few things here and there,

23
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,420
but the brain is a huge unknown
scientifically still.

24
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,460
We don't have a lot of tools yet to
better understand how we think the

25
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:38,190
memory and everything related to our
behavior,

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,040
so the brain will be probably the next
frontier,

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,400
but we should not forget that we have
still about 6,000 rare diseases that do

28
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:50,670
not have a treatment,
so we have a lot of work to do and we

29
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:53,490
cannot do it alone.
I mean money and investment is one

30
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:56,700
thing,
but we need to continue working on the

31
00:01:56,701 --> 00:02:01,701
framework of the regulatory agencies and
how we can partner with the regulators

32
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,740
to have a clear path forward to having
the new drugs approved.

33
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,800
The biggest challenge we face is science
is moving so fast that the regulators

34
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:18,120
have to catch up.
They have to catch up to understand and

35
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:23,121
catch up even more to regulate us,
which is a very daunting challenge and I

36
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,940
really believe that the regulators are
doing the right things in most of the

37
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,150
cases,
but at the same time I can only see the

38
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:37,230
challenges that they have to better
understand how the science is

39
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:39,540
progressing and you hear every,
every,

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,110
every day about the genomes and our
understanding of the genomes.

41
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,750
I mean,
this is absolutely flabbergasting the

42
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:50,550
progress we've made over the last 15
years in better understanding the inner

43
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:53,850
mechanics of how we work and from that
will come.

44
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,920
New Medications will come,
new cures,

45
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:56,880
new treatments.
