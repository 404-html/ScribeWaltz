1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,890
Mm,

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,960
so when we sleep and we have an empty
stomach,

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,500
then the activity,
the contractile activity of our gut

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,720
changes to a very unique pattern.
It's a 90 minute cycle,

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:24,090
very powerful wastes of contractions
migrate from the Esophagus all the way

6
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:27,070
down to the nfr,
large intestine,

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,820
and they move very slowly.
They have been.

8
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:37,110
So this has been referred to as the
intestinal housekeeper that sort of

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,290
cleans the gut from any residue that's
present,

10
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,890
um,
and the rhythm for that is generated by

11
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:47,110
the brain.
So it's dependent on the input of the

12
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:50,470
Vegas nerve on the,
on the second brain in the gut.

13
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:57,810
And this has been something that also
should occur when during daytime,

14
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:02,320
when I'm in between meals or when our
stomach and intestinal system is,

15
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,210
is empty.
However,

16
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:08,050
with this sort of modern habit of
snacking in between meals,

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,030
um,
so a lot of people don't have that

18
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:12,850
during the day,
but have it during sleep.

19
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,270
If you add the microbes into this now,
um,

20
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,130
it's,
it's quite likely I'm not really proven

21
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:21,430
it.
I mean,

22
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,430
the microbes obey some kind of a
circadian rhythm by themselves.

23
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:30,910
So the different drink,
sleep and during daytime,

24
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,550
um,
but it's,

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,360
it's quite plausible to assume that this
powerful waves that sort of cleans

26
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:40,030
everything out will also affect the
microbes,

27
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:44,260
the composition of the microbes because
if we don't have it,

28
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:49,261
so people that don't have that for some,
for some reason they will develop

29
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,180
abnormal.
I'm quoting cessation for example,

30
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:58,720
of the small bowel was a lot of microbes
that don't really belong there.

31
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,030
So clearly an important role in
regulating the populations and the

32
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,420
regional distribution of these microbes
now got what happens during sleep,

33
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:11,470
so during,
during rem sleep,

34
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,400
um,
and so on behalf

35
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,430
in a lot of activity going on within the
autonomic nervous system,

36
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:25,630
circuits within the brain and the
signals is being sent to the gut.

37
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:27,830
So our bodies inhibited,
um,

38
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,820
but not,
not our intestinal activity.

39
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,790
So in,
in many ways,

40
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,740
emotions they received.
Usually there'd be experienced visually

41
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,280
in our dreams,
have their mirror image in terms of

42
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:44,440
God's activity,
contractions,

43
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,960
secretions.
And again,

44
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:48,820
I mean,
just like everything that goes on within

45
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:51,730
the brain emotionally always is
reflected.

46
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:54,520
Just like our facial expression reflects
our emotions.

47
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,300
Everything reflects our emotional state,
either waking time asleep,

48
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,250
time at the gut level,
and the Micros who live in that

49
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:06,590
environment or affected by it.
So it's,

50
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,340
it's an area that's not studied in great
detail,

51
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:14,341
but probably very important for an
understanding of how the microbes,

52
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:19,080
the gut and the brain interact,
um,

53
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,960
and maintain health.
So sleep is a very important ingredient

54
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,480
for,
for health regulation of the immune

55
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:28,510
system,
but for the also regulation of the,

56
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,260
um,
of gut function and particularly got

57
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:33,810
microbial,
um,

58
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,420
integrity and wellbeing.
We know quite a bit about what happens

59
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:45,121
during sleep and during dreaming in
psychoanalysis,

60
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:50,221
this is a big window into our emotional
lives.

61
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,590
So Union or in Freudian psychoanalysis
have spent a lot of time interpreting

62
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:00,760
dreams and getting an access to this,
to this process.

63
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,240
A big portion is probably the processing
and constantly dation of memories that

64
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:09,430
have been experienced in the day.

65
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,510
Many of these of these memories have a
gut feeling components because every

66
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:21,511
time we have an emotion during the data
is always a counterpart at the gut

67
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:23,920
level.
That is then through the sensory

68
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:25,750
pathways,
goes back to the brain.

69
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,030
We may not experience it during the
daytime,

70
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,360
but it's encoded in this vast database
within the brain.

71
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,720
So what happens then during sleep,
there's this retrieval and then

72
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,580
processing consolidation of these
memories,

73
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:43,010
including all the guts feelings that are
associated with,

74
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,600
with those experiences that we had
during the day.

75
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,340
I think it's a very important point to
emphasize that emotions

76
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,030
have an integrated component of got
activity and got feelings regardless if

77
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:03,670
we feel it like the butterflies in the
stomach or the knot in the stomach,

78
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,050
every emotion has a component that the
brain engages got activity and that's

79
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:16,090
being reported back to the brain.
So you have to look at an emotion really

80
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:19,450
is a circular process within the brain,
gut access,

81
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,280
and um,
during sleep and during dreaming.

82
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:30,090
It's almost certainly a consultation and
processing of these myriad of,

83
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,340
of gut feelings that are generated
throughout the day.
