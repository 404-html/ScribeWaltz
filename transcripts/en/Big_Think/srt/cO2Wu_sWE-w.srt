1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,710
I'm
the one when we move,

2
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:19,340
we moved,
we went to Ireland because of the death

3
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,560
death of my,
my little sister.

4
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,800
And there were uh,
my brother frank,

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,280
myself and twin boys,
oliver and Eugene,

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,040
and when we got to Ireland,
uh,

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,190
we want to,
within two years the two boys,

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,850
you're Jaden Oliver died when they were
about four and four and a half of

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,960
various ailments at the time that nobody
cared too much about what was going on

10
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:46,760
with poor people.
There were no autopsies or anything.

11
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:50,660
He just died.
He just died and good riddance.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,240
But,
uh,

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,570
but when we got a children's levels,
three and a half,

14
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:58,010
frank was born,
uh,

15
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,850
uh,
we were known as Yanks and uh,

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,760
you feel outside the tribe when you are
speaking differently,

17
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:13,730
acting differently,
behaving differently.

18
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,180
So as quickly as possible,
you made the attempt to be a get in with

19
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:23,870
the gang,
talk like them and be like them and

20
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:24,800
dressed like them.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,820
So,
but no,

22
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,720
no matter what we did,
we were still yanks.

23
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,530
So then we grow up there and we come to
America,

24
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,830
uh,
back to America back here.

25
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,880
And they say,
Oh,

26
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:41,810
you're Irish over there were yanks over
here were Irish.

27
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:46,811
So my brother frank and myself decided a
long time ago that worked for your very

28
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:53,171
simply is we are New Yorkers.
This is our country,

29
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:59,290
this is my land,
this is the place for me where every

30
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:05,081
single dream I ever had came to fruition
and I love her dearly.

31
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,580
I love Yellow York
to be Irish in 2010,

32
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:22,281
2010.
There was a.

33
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,780
There is a pride in our

34
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,370
that that that's happened in our
intellectual accomplishments and our

35
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,600
literary accomplishments,
accomplishments in our technological

36
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,660
accomplishments,
but here to for a after,

37
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,020
oh,
800 years of occupation and the function

38
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:58,071
of the oppressor is to assure you that
you are nothing,

39
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,610
that you're nobody,
that you're less than deserving of

40
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:07,640
nothing.
That you are a piece of shit and I'm

41
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,810
don't aspire to anything,
and they infuse you with with shame,

42
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,970
which has to do with the past because
the all shamans based family in the

43
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:26,230
past.
It has to do with what you have done,

44
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,980
what you thought you will have done.
Ad Wants has sometimes seamus and juiced

45
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:37,261
by what has been done to you and by
allowing things to be done to you,

46
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:43,931
you are ashamed of not resisting.
So that's one part of a of oppression is

47
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:50,890
to make sure,
make sure you're a shameful,

48
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,920
shamed human being,
a then on the other,

49
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,280
and that takes care of the past and the
future has to do with fear.

50
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,180
Don't attempt to come up here.
Don't attempt to go forward.

51
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,740
You are,
you were nobody.

52
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:11,410
You are nobody and you'll always be
nothing.

53
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,800
So don't even think about coming here
because if you do something awful will

54
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:20,170
happen to you.
So we were,

55
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:26,130
we were caught between the two demons to
devil's shame and fear,

56
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,960
and we couldn't deal with the present,
which was that we are indeed as

57
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,030
accomplished in our own minds,
as spiritual,

58
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:44,950
as any other people,
as good as any other people.

59
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,270
But uh,
we could not look in the mirror.

60
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:51,580
I never said that.
That's what we are.

61
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:57,390
So to be Irish today is the abandonment
of that shame and the younger people are

62
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:04,750
moving it out and they're moving the
fear away.

63
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:06,520
They're not afraid,
they're adventurous,

64
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:10,450
they're going about the world as a care,
not carefree,

65
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,830
carefree,
I suppose.

66
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,140
But as with confidence and with the,
uh,

67
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,930
with the knowledge of the language,
with the education,

68
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,490
linguistically capable,
poetic and fun,

69
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:28,360
loving with a love of song and of life
itself.

70
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,560
So that for the younger people to be is,
um,

71
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,660
is,
is a great,

72
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,690
this wonderful thing that is happening.
The older ones of my generation are,

73
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:43,210
um,
in infused with.

74
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,940
They're still have the fear and the
various

75
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,180
ethnic groups have,
have diseases that are peculiar to their

76
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:57,040
group.
And for example,

77
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,050
Jewish people have a taste sacks and the
African Americans have sickle cell

78
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,560
anemia.
And the,

79
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:09,950
uh,
the Irish disease was respectability and

80
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:13,010
that infects them a lot.
And there was a,

81
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:16,430
what would somebody say was,
what would they say?

82
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:19,070
What would the English say if you wore
that?

83
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:20,750
Said that,
be that.

84
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:23,500
So consequently,
as the Irish poet a,

85
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:27,110
he said you eventually become the thing
you hate the most.

86
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,820
That's why so many of these Yahoos,
particularly the ones that run the

87
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:34,970
center St Patrick's Day parade are
conservatives.

88
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,240
And that conservatism is,
is not a political ideology.

89
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,240
It is a form severe form of brain damage
for which has hardly any cure.

90
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,190
I don't know what,
uh,

91
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,210
what we can do with them as a whole,
but they are gradually moving out.

92
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,230
The younger folks have taken over and
some day there may be some culture in

93
00:06:57,411 --> 00:07:02,240
this St Patrick's Day,
but I prefer if it were an Irish parade

94
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,130
like Israel,
Israel has a as a,

95
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,850
a parade that's Israel not devoted to
Moses or Abraham or Moses and Abraham.

96
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,290
And so I'd like to see the day when this
was an Irish because you can't be grand

97
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:23,291
marshal of this charade if you're not a,
a Catholic.

98
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,740
And they say a practicing Catholic.
Now,

99
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:30,590
a lot of these guys are hypocrites when
they are about,

100
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,930
they're about as a practicing as,
as I am.

101
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,050
And I don't certainly am not.
I have the whole thing myself.

102
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,360
But they are the,
it's hypocritical anyway,

103
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,750
and I hope that one day it will be an
IRA would be nourished,

104
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:50,990
prayed,
then I would march future.

105
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,560
If you have,
if you have one foot in the future and

106
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,500
one foot in the past,
you're pissing on the present.

107
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:03,050
So I stay in the present.
So I don't know about the future.
