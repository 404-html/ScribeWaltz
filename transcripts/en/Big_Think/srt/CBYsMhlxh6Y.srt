1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,003
Right,

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,040
well,
I,

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,560
I think that all of us who in some way
or Anglo Saxon a half to realize that

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,990
there are other ideas around,
um,

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,140
and that they can be added to our own
thinking and vocabulary and that we have

6
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:30,540
to be open minded towards others.
Now,

7
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:35,541
that doesn't mean that we give up
cultural basic assumptions such as human

8
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:42,330
rights,
such as the rights of women and children

9
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,980
because some of these basic assumptions
in our societies we must not give up and

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,830
we have to continue,
I think arguing and,

11
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:59,940
uh,
illustrating how they benefit society

12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,450
when you pursue them.
But that doesn't mean that you cannot

13
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:07,400
collaborate with countries far away,
uh,

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,440
which are inspired by a global community
that is all the time learning from each

15
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:16,320
other,
from different corners of the world.

16
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,950
And we don't have to give up our
identity even if we open up to other

17
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:24,180
cultures and other assumptions.

18
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,860
Well,
I think the basic thing we identified

19
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,550
was that in the 19 eighties we had come
so far in seeing the dramatic and

20
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,380
emerging trends of the planet being
affected by our human activities that

21
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,690
we,
for the first time in human history,

22
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:53,970
we realized that we are not only
responsible for each other,

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,830
those who are living today,
but that we are responsible to take care

24
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,770
of the opportunities for future
generations.

25
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,060
That was the basic,
I think,

26
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,080
content of that observation and about
the concept of sustainable development

27
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,810
that we need to also considered the
future of coming generations,

28
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,750
you know,
in the 5,100 years ago,

29
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,500
people south about future generations
with regard to their own son or daughter

30
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:30,561
taking over the farm,
but they didn't have to sync a in terms

31
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,360
of the global,
uh,

32
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,590
aspects of our footprints with undermine
the future choices of generations.

33
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:43,260
Unborn.
That's,

34
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:45,930
I think is the basic part of that
concept.
