1
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,480
Short story

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,070
collection,
so it was,

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,990
I did it over a number of years,
starting sometime in graduate school

4
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:20,730
when I was 23 and started publishing
things up through my twenties

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,500
and so it was,
I had been working on a novel and I

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,700
couldn't crack the novel form at all and
I just kept doing short stories in the

7
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:33,870
background.
And finally I realized I had 11 of them

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,950
that I was proud of and that I,
that could be a collection I hadn't

9
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:40,680
meant to do the pattern of publishing
short stories and then a novel.

10
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:42,180
I thought I'm a novelist,
I know it,

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,340
but you have to kind of write a lot of
bad novels before you can write a good

12
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:48,174
one.
I think.

13
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,670
So I did that and,
but meanwhile I love it.

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,543
Short stories.

15
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:59,443
Yeah.
Yeah,

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,313
I did.
It was,

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,320
they had a contest where,
um,

18
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,690
they would,
for some reason someone in the past love

19
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,820
music,
musical theater.

20
00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:08,654
And so they would,
if,

21
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,140
if you wrote a musical,
they would fully fund it and put it on

22
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:15,950
the main stage with full costumes and
the set and everything.

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,780
And uh,
my roommate,

24
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:19,160
she said,
we should totally do that.

25
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,460
That would be awesome.
She's the same one who talked me into

26
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,360
competing to be a commencement speaker,
which we did together.

27
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:29,360
She always had ideas.
She thought no one else was going to try

28
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:31,760
for this stuff.
So actually one of them we wrote the

29
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:33,680
night before and submitted it and we
won.

30
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,663
So two years

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,390
that prize,

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,610
I've tried that and it felt really
different.

33
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,650
Felt like you were
all the stuff.

34
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:54,651
I think I'm good at like a description
and internal experience and memory.

35
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,550
You can't do that.
Or at least I couldn't figure out a way

36
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,410
was action in present time and it was so
literal,

37
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,550
uh,
I felt really sort of bound as a

38
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:07,500
storyteller.
I think it would have.

39
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,380
It's a good thing for me to learn how to
do.

40
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,540
I think I learned from it about visual
storytelling,

41
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:16,410
but place you can do that a lot more
because they're a little more

42
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,340
the audience.
Imagine

43
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,010
the way they do in literature.

44
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,430
There was a variety of task.
Wire was a fiction piece.

45
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,410
It was crazy.
I was a.

46
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,270
That was the first thing I ever
published.

47
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,200
I sent it in.
I was sending in dozens of stories all

48
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,900
over the place against the rule.
You're supposed to double submit.

49
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:42,970
I just thought I'll send them
everywhere.

50
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:47,971
I must say I had 200 rejection letters
and then I got a call from esquire for

51
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:50,620
some reason.
Everyone at esquire had quit the fiction

52
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:55,621
department over some scandal and the
assistant was left in charge and he,

53
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:57,400
uh,
published my story,

54
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,130
you know,
it was just luck.

55
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,710
It was a cold pile.
