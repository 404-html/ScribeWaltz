1
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:12,190
They'll shaft writer Aquarius.
Well,

2
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:17,650
actually the first time,
you know,

3
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:20,440
I was always a funny and my family is
funny.

4
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:23,650
I'm the fifth of six children from the
large Jewish family.

5
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:26,110
That was,
it was never enough guilt to go around.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,440
And um,
when I was 18 I was at deerfield academy

7
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,840
and uh,
me and a few of my friends,

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,140
we might have stolen a faculty member's
car and we drove into North Hampton and

9
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:45,160
I did seven minutes of standup,
mostly stolen material at a bar called

10
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:50,050
the early times and from the ages of 18
to 22,

11
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:51,880
I think I probably performed twice a
year.

12
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:53,960
I wanted my undergraduate talent show
at,

13
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,200
at Harvard doing stand up.
And it was always something I knew I

14
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:01,840
could do.
It was always like a hobby with me,

15
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:05,080
but I always had the feeling that if the
nut came to crunch a,

16
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:06,490
I could make a little money at it.

17
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,260
But I majored.
I majored in Latin at Harvard because I

18
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:12,790
thought the church was going to come
back.

19
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,010
And um,
you know,

20
00:01:15,011 --> 00:01:19,090
it's one of those things where I majored
in Latin and Greek because I loved,

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,820
that was the only thing I really was
interested in academically.

22
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:25,390
It really,
I think it's the best preparation for a

23
00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:29,740
writer because it teaches you the value
of a word and of the word.

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,150
And um,
so I went to Harvard fully intending to

25
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:35,800
be either,
you know,

26
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,010
a Latin teacher or a pharmacist,
you know,

27
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:39,610
I mean really,
really,

28
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,460
what can you do with a classics degree?
And I'm a,

29
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,120
I ended up,
I think I got a c minus in.

30
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:50,140
I'm in a graduate course my freshman
year in Hurghada this.

31
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,190
And then I turned my sites to becoming a
sports writer.

32
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,460
And uh,
I did that for awhile and then I became,

33
00:01:57,461 --> 00:01:59,380
I was a standup comic for 13 years.

34
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,390
And then in 1991 I was hired,
uh,

35
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,220
by then late night with David Letterman
at NBC and,

36
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,690
and here we are
when you're 16,

37
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:13,700
17,
18,

38
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,500
and you're staying up and you're
watching the tonight show.

39
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,730
And this is,
this is the mid,

40
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,070
the early and mid seventies,
you know,

41
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:22,040
it's,
it's George Carlin and Richard Pryor.

42
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,680
And,
and I was introduced to Lenny Bruce when

43
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:29,681
I was 18,
so huge influence on not my standup but

44
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:36,611
me wanting to become a standup and I was
just one of those guys that I would

45
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:41,060
watch the standups and boy,
that must be great to do that.

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,380
But you know,
you never think that that's what you're

47
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:46,610
gonna do.
And,

48
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:48,410
and I ended up doing it for,
for,

49
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,540
for 13 years.
And uh,

50
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,640
I heard,
I don't know who's this line has,

51
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:56,350
but it's a great line,
is that people become standup comics.

52
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,890
Uh,
the same way a woman becomes a hooker.

53
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:00,880
I mean,
you start,

54
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,280
uh,
doing it,

55
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,080
um,
for,

56
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,310
uh,
a couple of friends and then you realize

57
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:10,600
you're good enough to get paid.

58
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,900
When I was a comedian and I was a comic
for 13 years,

59
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,060
my act was Jews sports and whether that
was pretty active.

60
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,160
Talk about being Jewish.
I did a lot of sports material because I

61
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:31,840
was a sports writer and uh,
and I also had a Gig a later on I was,

62
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,930
I had my own humor column in sports
illustrated for three years called the

63
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:36,700
show,
which I love,

64
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:39,160
which was the perfect marriage of all my
careers.

65
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:43,240
It was just topical jokes about sports
every week and um,

66
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,540
and,
and,

67
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,420
and I was a,
I'm going to steal David Letterman's

68
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:52,210
line about his standup career.
I was good.

69
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,680
I was a good standup,
but I was never going to be the guy that

70
00:03:56,681 --> 00:04:01,681
you pay $20 to see.
I was just not going to because because

71
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:07,960
unlike my wife who still performs my
heart wasn't in it.

72
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,550
I didn't have to be up there.

73
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,220
I was good enough to be up there.
I made a living at it.

74
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,840
But boy,
I'll tell Ya,

75
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,340
you know,
12 years in and you wake up in,

76
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,260
in a motel six in Covington,
Kentucky,

77
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,510
and you say to yourself,
I'm not in show business.

78
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,720
I'm just willy Loman with a bag of
jokes.

79
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:31,930
I'm just going from town to town trying
to,

80
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,810
you know,
trying to get the people in in a

81
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:38,050
different town and that's,
that's all it was.

82
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:39,130
But I was,
you know,

83
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:42,910
I was one of those guys that was out
there and I did every television show

84
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,980
except the ones that could help your
career.

85
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,740
It was so funny because they knew me at
the letterman show,

86
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:51,250
not as a writer because I used to
audition to try and get on the show as a

87
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,350
comic.
And I had a line in my act,

88
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,520
uh,
which has been a,

89
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,900
I'm proud to say has been stolen by
several comics at a line in my act.

90
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,330
I said,
for those of you here in New York,

91
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,900
it's great.
The dyslexic theater company is in town

92
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,880
and they're doing.
He gets your nug and Bob Martin,

93
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:10,840
the producer,
Letterman,

94
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:14,770
said,
if you have six more minutes as good as

95
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:16,210
that one line,
he said,

96
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:20,070
I will put you on next week.
And sadly I did.

97
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,240
I had some good lines.
I had some good lines.

98
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,220
I've forgotten them all.
I,

99
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:25,330
um,
you know,

100
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:29,140
a couple of years ago I wrote for Chris
Rock on the Academy Awards and he hired

101
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:32,860
a lot of comics to right,
and it was a lot of people I hadn't seen

102
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,450
a long time because I stopped performing
and Carol Liefer was one of the writers

103
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:40,510
and Carol for and we went out the first
night we went out for Chinese food and

104
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:41,710
Carolee for said,
you know,

105
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,270
every time I have Chinese food I think
about your bit about Chinese food.

106
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,240
And I said to her,
I'd love to hear it because I have no

107
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:51,970
recollection of this.
And the bit was I used to do a bit

108
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:53,110
about,
um,

109
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,660
you know,
when you go out for Chinese food,

110
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:58,700
they take down your order in Chinese,
the waiter,

111
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,300
how are you supposed to dispute this
bill at the end of the meals?

112
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:05,060
He gives me a waiter.
I didn't order the television antenna

113
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,610
and that's the kind of cutting edge
stuff that came out of me.

114
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,040
First of all.
Thank you.

115
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,100
Uh,
I'm,

116
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:22,101
I'm glad that the question is phrased so
that it's assumed that I write funny

117
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:26,150
stuff every day.
I appreciate that,

118
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,180
you know,
I think if you do it and if you,

119
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,550
if you write for a strip show,
which is what Letterman is,

120
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:33,530
which is a show that's on five days a
week,

121
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,210
um,
you don't think about it in terms of if

122
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:40,970
you ever,
if I ever thought about what I had to do

123
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,750
at the beginning of every day,
I don't think I could do it.

124
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,780
It's just with comedy writing,
especially writing on a daily basis.

125
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,700
It's a muscle that you work and it's,
it's,

126
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,680
you know,
and if you keep working it,

127
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,960
you can do it.
And Woody Allen once said about joke

128
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,790
writing,
if you can do it,

129
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,930
there's nothing to it.
And I believe that and I'm mostly with

130
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:07,820
the letterman show.

131
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,290
I've been a monologue writer,
so the,

132
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:13,700
I just write jokes for the most part.
I work on other stuff on the show and

133
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,850
it's just when I first started the show
in 1991 and they told me I had to write

134
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:22,010
15 jokes a day.
I thought,

135
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,310
how am I going to do this?
And then I just tried to get through

136
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:32,771
that day.
And then within about six months I was,

137
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,760
I wasn't writing 15 jokes a day,
I was writing 25 or 30 and it got to the

138
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:42,761
point where I was writing like 50 or 60
jokes a day and you know,

139
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,760
they're not all great and actually very
few of them are great.

140
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,910
But that's the thing about comedy is
that you have to,

141
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,660
you have to write a lot to get,
you have to make mounds and mounds of

142
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:58,661
Cole slaw to get one good serving.
And that's what we do on the letterman

143
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:01,370
show.
We just create a lot of content and

144
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:04,520
ideally the best content gets on the
show.

145
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,350
Here's the thing about the late show
with David Letterman,

146
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,160
the writers and Dave letter.
We write a lot of stuff that's funny.

147
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,930
We read a lot of stuff.
It's pretty good.

148
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,160
We read a lot of stuff that's lame,
but invariably,

149
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,490
invariably night after night,
the funniest moments in this show are

150
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:35,330
dave reacting in real time to his
surroundings.

151
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,070
And it's something that you cannot write
in preparation for the show.

152
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,930
And Dave comes out at the beginning of
the night,

153
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,920
the writer's job is to put him in a
situation where if he needs it,

154
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,320
it's there,
you know,

155
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,700
the monologue is there.
If he needs it,

156
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,580
the top 10 is there.
If he needs a couple of good tape pieces

157
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,840
are there,
if he needs it,

158
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,860
and then he can just relax and just
react in the moment.

159
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,480
And uh,
you know,

160
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:04,860
I have a friend,
Kelly Rogers,

161
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:09,480
who I started with who was a great comic
that people don't know about and Kelly

162
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,400
Rogers said something that was so
profound.

163
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,120
He said,
your act is for the nights when you're

164
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,140
not funny.
And,

165
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,110
and that's,
that's the,

166
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:24,140
that's what the writer's supply to Dave,
they supply him enact for those nights

167
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,030
when,
when he doesn't feel funny.

168
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,400
And,
and I have yet to see a nightlight that

169
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,740
Larry and I used to talk about this all
the time at the beginning of the show

170
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,720
because originally they got picked up
for four episodes and he would say just

171
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:45,960
enough for the four shows that we're
doing.

172
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,400
But after that they pick the show up.
I don't remember what am I supposed to

173
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:51,630
do?
And I said,

174
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:52,843
uh,
Larry,

175
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,960
uh,
it's eight in the morning.

176
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:00,020
I just woke up please.
But it's one of those things where the

177
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:05,100
longer you do it,
the more things occur to you.

178
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:09,090
And of course now Larry,
David having worried about that.

179
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,290
Okay,
let me start that again.

180
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,620
And now Larry David having worried about
that at the beginning,

181
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,920
he figured out a way throughout the
years to incorporate his life into his

182
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:22,920
work and you know,
how you know,

183
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:26,250
how you're out at dinner with friends
and somebody says something or something

184
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,190
happens and somebody at the dinner table
says,

185
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,130
this is just like an episode of Seinfeld
a,

186
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,840
okay?
That may or may not be true,

187
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:38,841
but when you're with Larry David,
you never know when a,

188
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,000
you know,
a scene from curb your enthusiasm is

189
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:44,880
going to burst out.
And I'll just give you an example.

190
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:46,170
A couple of years ago,
uh,

191
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:49,550
Larry and I were having dinner and,
uh,

192
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,560
we got to the end of the meal and I said
to him,

193
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,560
how about some dessert?
And he said to me,

194
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:58,230
no,
no dessert for me.

195
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,280
Ted Danson and I have a bet,
no dessert for a year.

196
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,840
And I thought,
who?

197
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,860
It's Larry David,
it's Ted Danson.

198
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,150
They're both billionaires.
The bed is no dessert for a year.

199
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:16,320
I mean,
the bed has got to be at least $50,000,

200
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:17,310
maybe 100,000,
maybe.

201
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:19,260
It's a million dollars.
I said to him,

202
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,030
how much is the bed for?
He says,

203
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,040
$200.
I said,

204
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,900
have a piece of frigging cake.

205
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:34,340
Let me just say this about Larry David a
try as he might to distance himself from

206
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:42,741
the character that the world sees,
he will be unsuccessful at that because

207
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,270
I,
I know this guy,

208
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,070
you know,
there's a great expression,

209
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,860
a alcoholics are just like everybody
else except more so.

210
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:58,410
And uh,
Larry David is just like the guy you see

211
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:03,721
in curb your enthusiasm except more so
he has,

212
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,790
um,
again,

213
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:14,740
and I wish this was my line,
but somebody once said about famous

214
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:16,380
people,
um,

215
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,660
when they get famous they don't get
better.

216
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,100
And Larry David is the exception to that
because Larry,

217
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,170
as he has gotten better known,
is much more comfortable in his skin and

218
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:34,090
he used to be and much more self aware.
And I'll give you an example.

219
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:35,900
We were at a Yankee game,
uh,

220
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,940
last year and a kid comes up,
you know,

221
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:40,870
18,
19 years old,

222
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:43,740
comes up with a pen and paper and his
is,

223
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,650
uh,
you know,

224
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,490
a Mr David can,
can I get short of graph?

225
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,310
And he and Larry says to them,
oh,

226
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,920
come back after the [inaudible] this is
no good either in the middle of a game.

227
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,990
And the kid says,
well,

228
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:58,530
I can always just come back in the,
in the,

229
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,400
you know,
after the inexact I'm watching the game.

230
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,990
And,
and the kid says,

231
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,973
uh,
but,

232
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,690
but you don't understand it,
let us know.

233
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,220
And then hearing himself do that,
he burst out laughing and sign the kid's

234
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,040
paper.
So like I have to tell you,

235
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,370
15 years ago,
that does not happen.

236
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,870
That does not 15 years ago,
uh,

237
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,130
this whole scenario winds up in small
claims court.

238
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,690
I've been at the letterman show since
1991 and that's 18 years and I would say

239
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:39,250
during that time the comedic sensibility
of the show has changed,

240
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,820
I want to say half a dozen times because
Dave has gotten older,

241
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,800
but the average age of the average
writer has stayed the same.

242
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:56,130
So they bring in their sensibilities and
what they think is fun and they try and

243
00:13:57,281 --> 00:14:01,120
interject it into the show.
And so the show's comedic sensibility,

244
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,580
uh,
changes and it's,

245
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,630
it's all valid and we don't write
anything and think,

246
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,260
oh,
I need to write this joke to appeal to

247
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:15,010
the crucial male,
18 to 34 demographic.

248
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,850
We don't think like that.
At least I don't.

249
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,970
I just think what's the funniest take
that,

250
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,400
that I can do.
And sometimes,

251
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,690
uh,
I think that things have passed me by

252
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,720
just because I'm older and the people
watching are our younger sometimes I

253
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:36,844
think that.

254
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,770
But funny is funny is funny.
And,

255
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:42,100
uh,
if you show somebody,

256
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:44,770
a Marx brothers movie who's never seen
one,

257
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,580
I think that they'll think it's funny
and I don't think that they're going to

258
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:51,770
ask why isn't groucho naked?
You know,

259
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,100
I want to see Groucho's deal
late night has really changed in the

260
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,683
last,
um,

261
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,280
I think in the last three decades,
let's say.

262
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,880
I think that first of all,
there's more variety and there's more

263
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:14,750
competition.
You know,

264
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:20,170
before 1982,
there was johnny and Johnny Carson and

265
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:26,921
people that he knocked off.
So all of late night was just,

266
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,230
was carson and it was a monologue.
It was some sort of body broad comedy

267
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,520
aimed at people over 30,
clearly,

268
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,970
um,
and uh,

269
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:48,010
white people over and white men over
over 30.

270
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,020
And um,
so that was it.

271
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:56,021
And then Dave came along in 1982 and NBC
gave Dave Letterman one directive,

272
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,890
uh,
whatever you do,

273
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,770
we want it not to be the tonight show.

274
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,520
So we want a three joke monologue,
not a 25 joke monologue a we want,

275
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,770
you know,
we just don't want it to look like the

276
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,900
tonight show.
So,

277
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,610
given that,
go ahead,

278
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:22,210
it was very free flowing.
It was irony based,

279
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,490
uh,
and it was a,

280
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:28,400
the old producer,
Bob Moore used to say a late night with

281
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:31,190
David Letterman.
It celebrated failure.

282
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,090
It was not slick.
It was very,

283
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:36,980
uh,
anarchistic.

284
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,830
And um,
so that was so,

285
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:43,100
so then that comes along.
Then,

286
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,960
uh,
you have dave move into cbs 1130 and you

287
00:16:47,961 --> 00:16:51,900
have this situation with Jay where,
uh,

288
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,500
you had a one show,
uh,

289
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:00,740
that was a host driven,
which is Dave and,

290
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,663
and,
uh,

291
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,720
material driven.
I'm more,

292
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:09,050
I would say more concept driven.
And then he had another show which is

293
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:14,051
Jay who was just essentially just a
comic who got his own show and its

294
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:19,320
monologue and guests and a little more,
uh,

295
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,900
a traditional.

296
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,600
And then you had the 1230 shows with
Conan and all of a sudden they were.

297
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,990
David started this with going after
younger audiences.

298
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,730
I mean,
people always say,

299
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:34,780
I started watching Dave and college and
uh,

300
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,330
so there was a real market out there.
And then,

301
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,160
like I mentioned before,
late night became this very lucrative,

302
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,830
um,
uh,

303
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,460
industry for the networks,
very cheap to produce very,

304
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,860
and course once a commercialism,
once people start making money,

305
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,690
it's going to tend to get watered down
and it's not gonna be as a,

306
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,790
it's not going to be as fearless,
um,

307
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,490
because there's a lot of people that
depend their livelihoods depend on your

308
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:12,090
success,
so it's not just kids screwing around

309
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,450
anymore.
And then what happened in,

310
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,570
I would say the late nineties,
uh,

311
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,950
is that the other,
the cable emerge as a late night force

312
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,460
with the daily show and Kobe Bayer and
it was much more topical,

313
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,870
not that the Letterman show we always
took care of what was in the news and so

314
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:36,000
did Jay,
but it,

315
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:41,060
it became a more of a,
the,

316
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,440
the topical stuff.

317
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,620
It became more topical and more issue
oriented.

318
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,980
And,
and I think we've certainly gone in that

319
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:54,981
direction at the late show.
And so that's the evolution of that now.

320
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,600
I think that
if I was to predict and,

321
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:04,140
and believe me,
I'm always wrong.

322
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,010
So put your money elsewhere.
I think we're going to reach a critical

323
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:13,070
mass with the topicality thing and
people getting their news because I

324
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:19,971
think it's going to get a little too
partisan and I think that a late night

325
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:27,081
shows are going to be put in a situation
that they shouldn't be put in a,

326
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,630
you know,
unbeknownst to them,

327
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:36,110
and I think it's probably going to go
back to a little sillier and,

328
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:38,180
um,
uh,

329
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:43,020
a little less a celebrity driven and,
um,

330
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,700
and,
and kind of easier to take and less fo

331
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,310
serious.
You look at a guy like Craig Ferguson

332
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,280
and watch what he's doing.
He,

333
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:57,690
nobody is doing what he's doing and,
and I think he'll,

334
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,380
I think he'll,
he will emerge because he is silly.

335
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,410
It's all him,
you know,

336
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,910
uh,
you know,

337
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:07,920
the guests don't really have to say
anything.

338
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:10,230
He's going to take care of it.
And I think that,

339
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:11,970
um,
I think that that's where we're going.

340
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,080
I don't think that Johnny ever dream
that he would influence a,

341
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,990
an election.
Um,

342
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,021
you know,
he,

343
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:27,890
uh,
he never talked about Watergate when

344
00:20:27,891 --> 00:20:30,330
Watergate was going on and talked about
it after the fact.

345
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,950
Uh,
but,

346
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,880
uh,
you know,

347
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,520
Tina fey had as much to do with the last
election as a,

348
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,270
as Dave did with the situation with
mccain as the daily show,

349
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,220
a does.
So,

350
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,570
uh,
you know,

351
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,460
look where is,
I mean that's where we are,

352
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:50,230
where these shows and,
and,

353
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:50,950
and,
and,

354
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,070
and none of these shows set out to
influence elections,

355
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,130
but that's what happens.
They're there,

356
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,300
right in the popular culture.
And you know,

357
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:01,770
I never bought all those,
uh,

358
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:05,920
um,
studies and surveys about people getting

359
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:09,790
their news from late night television.
I and I still don't,

360
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,290
but I think that people turn to late
night television,

361
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,340
um,
to see what the point of view is on the

362
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:20,800
news.
I think they know going in,

363
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:22,510
I don't think we're in the education
business.

364
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:27,070
Here's the deal with society.
People Fall in love with the idea of

365
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:29,680
things rather than the reality of
things.

366
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,580
And that holds true for late night.
You know,

367
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:38,380
it's,
it's so much a more provocative and

368
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:43,470
sexier to say that people are watching
our show and getting their news from

369
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:46,900
Dave letterman.
And let me tell you,

370
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:51,040
as somebody that writes monologue jokes
and somebody that knows Dave,

371
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,180
I tell them,
you,

372
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,860
we find that very funny.

373
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:03,270
Here's the difference between a writing
a monologue jokes in writing a fiction,

374
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,501
uh,
well,

375
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:09,730
first of all,
use the word intern much less and

376
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:11,560
waterboarding much less when you write
fiction.

377
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,593
No,
it,

378
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,570
it's,
it's just,

379
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,600
it's a different muscle.
A writing a monologue jokes or writing

380
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:22,630
jokes for a nightly show is a volume
business.

381
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:28,290
It's a volume business.
You're just turning out a quantity and

382
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:32,110
then panning for gold.
So it's,

383
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,050
you're using,
uh,

384
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,810
in,
in the words of the steroid universe,

385
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,700
you're using your quick twitch muscles.
You know,

386
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,710
you're just firing more,
you're firing quicker and you're just

387
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:49,720
reacting quicker.
And it's all about,

388
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:53,560
takes different,
how many different takes to a premise.

389
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,610
So that's,
that's writing comedy for television.

390
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,850
Now,
writing a fiction,

391
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:05,910
writing humorous fiction,
everything slows down and it's a

392
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,890
different muscle and it's a state of
mind.

393
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,380
And uh,
you know,

394
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:15,670
I think writing jokes is,
is a real physical practice.

395
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:21,280
And um,
and it's all free association and,

396
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,460
and writing fiction.
Again,

397
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:28,480
it's inhabiting a,
it's getting into a state of mind where

398
00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:32,470
you're a for me,
where you're inhabiting this world of

399
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:37,120
these characters you created.
And for me,

400
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,980
writing fiction,
you know,

401
00:23:38,981 --> 00:23:42,880
I want to be funny.
I want my premises to be funny.

402
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,150
I want my situations to be funny.
I want my characters to be complicated,

403
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:52,660
but it must be plausible.
It must be even however chaotic.

404
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,380
It must be plausible.
And the thing about a lot of great

405
00:23:57,381 --> 00:24:00,980
monologue jokes is that they are not
plausible.

406
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,550
There's sort of a little really,
you know,

407
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,090
it's like when we talked about this,
people ask me,

408
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,980
how'd you learn to write fiction?
Well,

409
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,230
I learned to write fiction writing for
Dave because,

410
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,910
uh,
you know,

411
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:18,911
all of a sudden we'd have some jokes
about Hillary Clinton and Dave would

412
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,980
say,
let's just start it with,

413
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,960
hey,
have you heard Hillary Clinton's going

414
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:24,920
to jail?
Well,

415
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,500
she's not.
She never was,

416
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,680
but he loved that it was a grabber.
He could get a laugh and then he would,

417
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,940
he could come down off it,
off the joke.

418
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,740
Now
that might find its way in somebody

419
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:42,980
else's novel,
but it's never going to find its way in

420
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,360
a minute.
I'll give you an example.

421
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:50,630
When Hillary was elected to the Senate,
um,

422
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,180
and,
and then bill was out of office.

423
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,720
There was a story in the times that he
was a little lonely in Chappaqua.

424
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,760
He was sort of rattling around the
house,

425
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:07,030
so he would go down once a week and have
breakfast at a coffee shop in Chappaqua.

426
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,660
And that's kind of quaint.
It's kind of charming.

427
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,920
Well,
that,

428
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,100
that wasn't good enough for us.
That was,

429
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,860
that we didn't like that,
that wasn't good comedically.

430
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,840
So we did jokes for two weeks about him
hanging out at a singles bar in

431
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:28,670
Chappaqua.
We just made up all these and it was

432
00:25:28,671 --> 00:25:30,740
great and we had a ball with it.
And,

433
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,870
and it is it.
Well,

434
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,960
I guess I'm sort of arguing against
myself because it is a little plausible.

435
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,280
The Clinton might go to a singles bar,
but we just made it up and um,

436
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,960
and people knew we had made it up and it
was,

437
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,690
it was very valid as,
as a,

438
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:51,920
as comedy.
So that's the deal of the best advice I

439
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:55,320
ever got about writing fiction was,
um,

440
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,810
right.
What you know,

441
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,870
and make your character's lives
complicated because,

442
00:26:00,871 --> 00:26:02,640
you know,
we all have a story in us and it's,

443
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:06,500
it's our autobiography.
And I know we think it's fascinating.

444
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:09,920
God knows I do and it may very well be
fascinating,

445
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,570
but it aint complicated.

446
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,380
This is my third novel.
Everything hurts and,

447
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,740
and it is,
um,

448
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,710
it is born of a real life.
This is a book about a guy trying to get

449
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:29,711
rid of a psychosomatic limp.
And he seeks the aid of a legitimate

450
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,950
self help guru.
He's an accidental self help guru and to

451
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:41,930
cure him of his psychosomatic limp,
he seeks the aid of a legitimate self

452
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:46,931
help guru and is borne of real life.
Because for three and a half years I

453
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,810
dragged a foot,
I limped,

454
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:53,930
I was in constant pain and it was a.
It confounded doctorsx,

455
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,510
rays and Mris,
turned up nothing.

456
00:26:57,511 --> 00:27:02,511
The pain moved around.
There was no consistent symptomatology.

457
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:07,140
It came and went of its own accord.
It made no sense to anybody,

458
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:12,090
but I was in constant pain and so I
sought the help of a guy who specialized

459
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,430
in a psychosomatic pain.

460
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,880
And uh,
he believes that the pain is caused by

461
00:27:19,981 --> 00:27:24,930
unconscious rage driving to your
conscious mind and your conscious mind

462
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:29,931
is so threatened by the coming rage that
it tries to distract you by giving you

463
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:34,740
pain to a vulnerable area.
That's his theory.

464
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,260
I still believe in it.
I really do.

465
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,830
And so his approach is to examine your
past.

466
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:42,930
So I'd been seeing him for a little
while and I said,

467
00:27:42,931 --> 00:27:46,620
you know what I'm gonna do.
I'm going to write a novel about a guy

468
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:51,270
trying to get rid of a psychosomatic
limp and try to get myself out of this

469
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:53,260
pain.
And I started writing it.

470
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,950
It took me two years to finish.
Two years later,

471
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:59,670
I'm finished with the book,
son of a bitch guy in the book is fine.

472
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,790
I'm still dragging a foot and in
constant pain.

473
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,850
So I sold the book to Simon and
Schuster.

474
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,880
Ten days after I sold the book I went to
yet another doctor took another look at

475
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:13,980
another x ray and said to me,
you need a hip replacement.

476
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,890
I'm not telling you you should get one.
I'm telling you,

477
00:28:16,891 --> 00:28:19,410
you have to get one.
This is a no brainer.

478
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,730
And so a year ago in July,
last July,

479
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,220
I got my hip replaced.
I'm out of pain.

480
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:29,310
I feel great.
And everybody who,

481
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,370
you know,
suffered along with me said,

482
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,300
you must be furious.
Three and a half years limping and

483
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:38,100
constant pain.
And I say the same thing,

484
00:28:38,101 --> 00:28:39,990
all of them.
If I hadn't done that,

485
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,550
I wouldn't have gotten the book out of
it.

486
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:42,960
So,
you know,

487
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,030
the journey is the destination,
right?

488
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,850
You have no idea.
Um,

489
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,050
because as I,
as I mentioned,

490
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,120
I was in constant pain and one of the
few times that I was not in pain was

491
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:02,730
when I was writing.
And I mean writing at the letterman show

492
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,640
or working on the fiction,
but at the end of the day here,

493
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,580
the day would be over.
I'd come home and relax,

494
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,980
put my feet up,
incredible pain,

495
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,700
and they could not be relieved by any
pill or anything like that,

496
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:19,701
which made me sure it was a.
and so this book is a reflection of

497
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:23,400
that.
And,

498
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:24,720
uh,
I think that,

499
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,220
um,
you know,

500
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:27,930
and I'm sure people have said this
before,

501
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:28,860
but,
uh,

502
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,920
artists create because they have to,
not because they need to and not because

503
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,800
they think they should,
but because they have to.

504
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,780
And this is,
this was a classic case of it.

505
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:48,781
So it was very fulfilling.
It was very ambitious because I was

506
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:54,091
suffering while I was writing it and the
guy is getting better and it's like,

507
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,660
and I was aspiring to the character I
was writing about,

508
00:29:58,661 --> 00:30:02,620
which is a boy,
I'd love to recreate that in my next

509
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:03,850
book.
Wouldn't that be great?
