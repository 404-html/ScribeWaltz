1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,320
Finding a government that is more
responsive to,

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,290
uh,
to the real problems that we're having,

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,740
not just

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,580
politically,
but in terms of the globe,

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,000
the planet.
Um,

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,450
I don't have anything new to add to
this,

7
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:22,990
but
as someone said,

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,960
read the other day that if we do
something,

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,420
if we start doing something about
climate change now,

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,920
it'll be a lot different from starting
five years from now or worse 10 years

11
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:34,920
from now that,
um,

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,930
and I think people's minds are changing.
We've gone,

13
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:42,550
I think from some sense of alarmism kind
of a chicken little sense of the

14
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:46,360
planet's gonna Cook Up to 190 degrees
and we're all gonna die.

15
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,590
Um,
we've got the evidence just keeps

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,480
mounting,
which,

17
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:54,580
uh,
has resulted,

18
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:57,910
I think in a well growing consensus
that,

19
00:00:57,911 --> 00:00:58,900
uh,
that yeah,

20
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:00,780
this is,
this is real and it's not,

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,610
it's not good.
Alternatives to war.

22
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,560
Um,
again,

23
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:09,730
when I was listening to a,
a talk earlier today,

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,760
which talked about lifting a Edm in out
of Uganda and placing them somewhere

25
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:16,650
else.
And,

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,483
and,
uh,

27
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,843
and,
uh,

28
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,380
without destroying the whole country,
I mean a way of ways of neutralizing

29
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:28,381
dictators that are less or that are more
humane and less destructive than just an

30
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:33,580
all out war on the country.
Uh,

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,600
I think I'm a leader that would have a
more inventive sense of strategies

32
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,040
because we need some new paradigm in war
is sort of an,

33
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,520
it should be.
We should be over that,

34
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:53,410
that,
that old paradigm of just throwing our

35
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:56,230
youngest people into the face of,

36
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,660
of danger.
