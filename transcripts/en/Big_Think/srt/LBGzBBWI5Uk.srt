1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,133
Well,

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:07,741
first of all,
I mean,

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:12,360
mostly what I do is analysis and if we
think about analysis,

4
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:14,910
whether it's a book or an opinion
column,

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,220
when it works,
it helps you read the newspaper better,

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:20,941
right?
I mean,

7
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:21,940
it's,
it,

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,540
it's,
it's not just giving people information,

9
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:29,040
it's giving people analysis and
connecting the dots between a few

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,760
different pieces of information that
creates that sort of Aha click of

11
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:34,230
clarity.
Um,

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,410
and when you read strong analysis,
clear analysis and it makes you feel

13
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:41,760
better equipped,
right?

14
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:46,680
It's sort of ammo and um,
so as an opinion writer,

15
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:51,570
as a columnist,
I know that that's my goal is helping

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,590
people get more of those cliques of
understanding because I think that we

17
00:00:55,591 --> 00:01:00,591
feel bombarded with information.
We are bombarded with information,

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,960
but we are extremely disoriented and
the,

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,810
what I'm doing now,
what I'm trying to do now with this book

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,920
is I feel like we're still in somewhat
of a state of shock from September 11th.

21
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,780
Uh,
and that a state of shock is about a gap

22
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,940
that opens up between an event and,
and,

23
00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:26,910
and,
and our analysis of that event.

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,240
And that's what shocked means something
happens that so big that we lose our

25
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:36,300
collective story.
And I think the Bush administration has

26
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:40,470
been really adept at heightening that
state of disorientation by telling

27
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:44,070
people everything you thought you knew
before September 11th is wrong.

28
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,380
We're rebooting history,
we're starting over.

29
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,670
Right?
And if you think about what,

30
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,860
what,
what most people wanted to do after

31
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:54,861
September 11th is they actually wanted
to do the work to integrate that event

32
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,960
into their story,
right?

33
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:59,400
This,
this was an event that seemed to come

34
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,110
out of nowhere,
but nothing comes out of nowhere.

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,330
So people wanted to know history and
the,

36
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:08,460
they were hungry for that knowledge that
could bridge the gap between event and

37
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,830
collective and enter collective story.

38
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,890
Um,
so I guess that's what I see myself

39
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:18,600
doing is helping that bridging process
because when we're in a state of shock,

40
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,810
we're very vulnerable to political
manipulation.

41
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:23,400
We're frightened,
we regress.

42
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,800
We think Rudy Giuliani's are long lost
daddy,

43
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:26,221
you know,
I mean,

44
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:28,230
this is dangerous.
And I think,

45
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,570
you know,
good politicians were effective

46
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:31,950
politicians,
not good politicians,

47
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:36,060
but effective politicians understand
that they are very powerful in those

48
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:41,061
moments when people are disoriented.
So analysis a,

49
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,920
it connects the dots,
gives us a new story and orients us.

50
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,380
Uh,
and that's when we're better citizens.

51
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:53,430
That's when we can engage in debates.
That's when were harder to manipulate.

52
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:55,140
That's when we're smarter,
a calmer,

53
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,540
more focused.
Um,

54
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,451
so,
you know,

55
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:59,300
that's what,
that's what all analysis.
