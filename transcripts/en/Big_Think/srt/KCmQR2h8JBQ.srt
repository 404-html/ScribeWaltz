1
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,720
Well,
the gap that the celebrity feels is that

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,900
the celebrity can reach millions of
people like that.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,800
So the fact that they land a voice,
so they need to Africa,

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,980
it makes millions of people that
wouldn't even care about Africa.

5
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:26,981
Look towards what's going on in Africa.
I think,

6
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,023
you know,
there's,

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,430
um,
I think a celebrity prep period during

8
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:36,431
any form of charity is a great thing
because a celebrity don't really have to

9
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:38,750
do anything as much as you want to think
they do.

10
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:41,530
They're celebrities.
So they could actually just chill and

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,910
don't do nothing.
But the thing is,

12
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,620
but then there's those celebrities that
don't own the land.

13
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:49,940
They name,
they act on it.

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,990
Um,
and of course the bar is rose so high

15
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:57,080
for these celebrities.
People like Angelina Jolie.

16
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,430
Um,
she's,

17
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,200
she been to Haiti with me,
Brad Pitt.

18
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,920
I mean,
look what Brad's doing at New Orleans.

19
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:06,560
You know what I'm saying?
Real initiatives.

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,030
George Clooney,
like going to these places,

21
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,000
looking with their eyes and,
and,

22
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:15,680
and learning.
And then I'm bringing the information

23
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:19,220
back to the American people.
I think that's where the future is

24
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:19,740
headed.

25
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,480
[inaudible].
