1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,070
Well,
let me lay on you.

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,840
One.
Libertarianism is to me,

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,950
once again,
I'm speaking for myself,

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,930
which is about as libertarian is you can
get,

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,570
I do not believe I know what's best for
other people.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,810
I also don't believe that other people
know what's best for other people.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,440
I can barely make decisions for myself.
I do my best to make decisions for my

8
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:37,460
family.
Shouldn't my 10 year old son take music

9
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:41,510
lessons?
That's a hard question for our family.

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,810
You want to push them into it or wait
until he really wants it.

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,980
It was a hard decisions.
I have trouble making those for my

12
00:00:48,981 --> 00:00:52,580
family,
so making the decision of what someone

13
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:55,130
else's job and healthcare should be
like.

14
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,940
It was in another part of the country
who I've never met is not something I'm

15
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:03,050
qualified or desire is to do.
That's libertarianism.

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:09,520
Libertarianism is taking a right on
money and your first left on sex and

17
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:15,740
looking for utopia straight ahead to me.

18
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,320
The way I was brought up western
Massachusetts,

19
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,530
kind of a New England philosophy,
we believed in responsibility and

20
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,200
keeping your nose out of other people's
business.

21
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,710
We believed in live and let live,
I think to a fault.

22
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,250
Um,
my mom and dad were older parents too.

23
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,950
My mom was 45 and I was born,
so I was raised by another generation.

24
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,223
She,
my mom was,

25
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,220
my mom would be,
whatever,

26
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,070
120 now or 115 now,
um,

27
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,930
whole of the generation.
My mom was born.

28
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,580
Now you're going to see that my math is
wrong.

29
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,010
My mom was born in 1909.
Uh,

30
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,710
she's dead now.
Um,

31
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,760
so it's a whole different generation.
And my mom's feeling about absolutely

32
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,360
everything was,
who cares?

33
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,870
Uh,
her whole feeling I'm the gay rights

34
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:13,871
movement was who cares who they wanted
get together with.

35
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,060
It doesn't matter to me.
Her whole feeling on drugs.

36
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,930
I have never had a sip of alcohol or any
recreational drug in my life.

37
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,330
That was true for my mother too,
from my father too,

38
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:25,250
for my sister.
I don't know how many generations that

39
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:27,020
goes back,
but never.

40
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,680
And yet my mom always thought that,
sure,

41
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:32,690
any drugs should be legal.
If you're,

42
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,790
if you're living in a free country,
do whatever you want.

43
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,400
Um,
take responsibility for it.

44
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,340
When you tell people about
libertarianism,

45
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,050
um,
you just tell them we think you should

46
00:02:45,051 --> 00:02:50,051
take as little from other people by
force as possible and you should be able

47
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:55,811
to do whatever you think is right.
Now that's a pretty heavy thing I'm

48
00:02:56,121 --> 00:03:01,121
saying because I'm saying that if
there's an 18 year old girl who was the

49
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,720
greatest math wiz that we have in this
country,

50
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,180
let's say she's the smartest person at
math.

51
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:13,570
We have anywhere.
And let's say we give her a full

52
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:17,470
scholarship to go to whatever school she
wants to go to,

53
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:19,330
Stanford,
mit or wherever she wants to go.

54
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,300
And she decides she wants to work at
Mcdonald's and get pregnant

55
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,490
at the age of 19.
That's her decision.

56
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,700
Jim Morrison,
did he have a worse life because he did

57
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:42,701
an awful lot of drugs and died at 28.
I don't know.

58
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,860
I've already lived a lot longer than Jim
Morrison.

59
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:47,510
Boy,
his choices worse than mine.

60
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,993
I Dunno.

61
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,130
I know.
I would not have liked to have lived

62
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,350
like Jim Morrison,
although I'd like to look that good and

63
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:56,330
leather pants.
But,

64
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,600
um,
Kurt cobain did that.

65
00:03:59,601 --> 00:04:01,430
I want to live like that.
No,

66
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,850
not even slightly prince.
I don't want to live like that.

67
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,160
Uh,
but uh,

68
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,870
they probably don't want to live like me
either.

69
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,920
Um,
libertarianism is the strongest sense of

70
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,430
please do what you want.
Try not to hurt me.

71
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,010
Our government has a monopoly on force,
have a monopoly on force.

72
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,300
The government is the only organization
that is supposed to be able to use for

73
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:35,120
us.
The government is supposed to be a

74
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:37,700
government
of us,

75
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,690
which means in my thinking,
my morality,

76
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,760
the government should only use force for
things I'm willing to use.

77
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:51,140
Force for the government are the only
ones that are allowed to use guns to

78
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:55,250
hurt another person or threatened
another person legally for the question

79
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:57,050
becomes,
what would I use a gun

80
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,483
to do?

81
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,030
No,
I'm a coward and I have no skills with

82
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:04,990
guns,
with violence.

83
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:07,150
I've never hit a person in anger in my
life.

84
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,340
I've been hit.
I've never hit back.

85
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,840
So this is hypothetical,
but if I were not a coward,

86
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,550
would I use a gun to stop someone from
being killed?

87
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,390
Yes,
but he used a gun to stop from being

88
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:23,980
raped.
Yes.

89
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,680
What?
I use a gun to build the library.

90
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,550
I take money from someone to build the
library.

91
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,070
Well,
I'd certainly give my money.

92
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,040
I certainly work.
I'd certainly beg you for money to build

93
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,110
the library.
Library's really mattered to me.

94
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,440
Um,
I was born in 55 and from a small town

95
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,000
without a library,
I would have known nothing.

96
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:46,060
I had to drive to them.
I had to ride my bike to the library to

97
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:48,800
learn about Lenny Bruce Franz Kafka.
Uh,

98
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,940
I got stravinsky records in the library
meant everything to me.

99
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,470
A library is matter,
but

100
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,770
that's the libertarian question.
Now,

101
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,020
taking care of people.
Would you use a gun to take care of

102
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:04,430
others?
Um,

103
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,680
that's a hard one because taxation is
using violence.

104
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,380
Now people try to say taxation is
voluntary.

105
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,720
It's not.
If you don't pay your taxes,

106
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,700
eventually somewhere down the line,
someone with a gun will show up.

107
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,450
They just will some at some point.
If you don't do that.

108
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,290
Um,
what do we do with our taxes?

109
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,530
We used a gun to defend our country.
Yeah,

110
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,140
I guess we got it right.
Um,

111
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,660
but we use a gun for everything we use
for taxes.

112
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,630
So when I see the government doing
something,

113
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,890
I asked myself,
would I use a gun to do that?

114
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,260
Now all of that being said,
that is a high level.

115
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:53,290
The theoretical part of libertarianism
to me in a nuts and bolts level becomes

116
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:56,300
much,
much simpler.

117
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,130
This is one of the cases where the,
the reality is simpler than the,

118
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:02,750
uh,
than the theory.

119
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,520
When someone's worried about
libertarianism,

120
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:10,070
they worry about what happens to public
schools.

121
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,670
What happens to a welfare,
what happens to roads?

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,520
Those are the first three questions they
ask.

123
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:22,060
And those are the hardest questions.
I will give you public schools.

124
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,190
I will give you welfare.
I will give you infrastructure.

125
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,880
I will not give you the government using
a gun to take money from poor people and

126
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:38,951
giving it to rich people.
The biggest issue in libertarianism is

127
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:44,240
stopping corporate welfare.
What we give in welfare to the poor,

128
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,940
we give in government money to the
roads.

129
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,030
We give him money.
Giving money to the schools is nothing

130
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:52,730
compared to the money we give to rich
people.

131
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,180
The best way to stop crony capitalism,
the West way to stop graft,

132
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,640
the best way to stop,
uh,

133
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,840
uh,
uh,

134
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,910
all sorts of bad stuff in government is
to make government small enough.

135
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,300
The way you stop corruption is make it
small enough to corruption.

136
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:15,230
Doesn't pay,
give the government little enough that

137
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:20,231
there's not a lot to steal from them.
The government is buoying up the rich

138
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,800
corporations.
The rich corporations love the

139
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:27,230
government.
They gain the system in a way.

140
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:31,370
An individual never can.
Any big corporation has a team of the

141
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:34,730
best lawyers to figure out how they can
not pay taxes.

142
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,560
No middle class person has that.
They have all,

143
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,990
they have regulations set to keep other
people out of the business,

144
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:44,150
right?
Even the manicure shops,

145
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,710
you know,
they want to license,

146
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,070
register everything so that,
so that other people can't get in.

147
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,820
It's limiting.
If you had a true free market,

148
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,070
you would not have the big mega
corporations.

149
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,230
Uh,
libertarianism is not about rich white

150
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:04,830
people getting a lot of money for
corporations and leaving everybody else

151
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:05,664
to whistle.

152
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,680
Libertarianism is,
let's not use the government to take

153
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:13,800
money from poor people and middle class
people and give it to rich people

154
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:16,470
because really that's all that's ever
happened.

155
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,710
That's all that's ever happened in our
present,

156
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,770
uh,
climate.

157
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,730
We have somebody running for president
who we know for a fact lied,

158
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,520
lied a lot less than other people.
We know for a fact she lied and we know

159
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:43,431
for a fact that she is an insider and
that knows the way to play all the

160
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,240
games.
Uh,

161
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,990
we also know that she knows what's
better for other people.

162
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:53,940
I mean know that she says and claims and
brags that she will do a lot of killing

163
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:58,941
of people overseas.
We also know that she is essentially,

164
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,870
even if I've called her a liar,
she's essentially a good,

165
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:06,930
honest person,
but she essentially has a good heart.

166
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,440
She also has a 65% disapproval rating or
higher.

167
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,040
That's Hillary Clinton.
There were two things that I always

168
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:21,780
believed about modern politics.
One was that

169
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,120
everyone who would ever run for a major
office was smarter than me.

170
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,470
And the second thing was there was no
one worse than Hillary Clinton.

171
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,000
Both of those things have been disproven
by Donald Trump.

172
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,280
Donald Trump,
all the good qualities I mentioned about

173
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:46,580
Hillary Clinton.
Donald Trump does not share.

174
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,470
He's not skilled.
He does not have as I far as I can tell

175
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:53,900
any compassion.
Um,

176
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,050
and he,
uh,

177
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,630
does not have very much knowledge.
Uh,

178
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:04,631
he does have a weird kind of a charisma
that I cannot understand myself.

179
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:09,440
It doesn't seem to work on me,
but certainly demonstrative that he has

180
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:15,250
a charisma that works for some people
and he's willing to give easy answers

181
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,580
and being willing to give easy answers,
which in his case aren't answers,

182
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:21,440
they're just,
I will fix it.

183
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,920
We've got this problem.
I'll fix it.

184
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,240
Well,
no,

185
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:28,790
you don't get to say that.
You have to demonstrate how you're doing

186
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:33,791
it.
But both Hillary Clinton and Donald

187
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:38,540
Trump
are very interested in getting a lot of

188
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:42,560
power for themselves.
I believe Hillary Clinton wants that

189
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:45,530
power cause she thinks she knows what's
best for other people.

190
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,070
Let's refer back to me saying,
I don't know what's best for other

191
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:51,230
people.
I also don't think she does either,

192
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:53,710
but she believes that,
and I believe heart's in the right

193
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:56,530
place.
I don't think Donald Trump knows there

194
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:58,760
are other people,
um,

195
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,010
to be concerned about.
I don't think he even knows that you've

196
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:06,850
got those two and neither one of them as
this is not fair to Hillary Clinton.

197
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,320
Donald Trump is giving no,
uh,

198
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,660
theoretical policy ideas for how
government should run.

199
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,600
Hillary Clinton is not giving enough for
my taste.

200
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,730
Here's their bed.
I want to see

201
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,210
not even a debate conversation,
public conversation in front of as much

202
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,460
of America's wants to watch it.

203
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,390
Bernie Sanders,
Gary Johnson,

204
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,760
both paragons,
both virtuous,

205
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,670
both honest,
both smart,

206
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,510
both concerned about other people,
both his experience in government.

207
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,030
And I want to hear Bernie Sanders say,
you know,

208
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,990
lot of people in this country have
trouble taking care of themselves.

209
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,170
We need a strong infrastructure for
business to thrive.

210
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,430
We need to protect our country to
protect the people around us.

211
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,730
We need a big strong government with a
good solid safety net that can take care

212
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:11,290
of people and treat them with compassion
and they better choices than some

213
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,680
individuals will make.
We need a government were more

214
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:16,870
qualified.
People can take care of those that

215
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:20,560
aren't and where we can keep
corporations at bay and where we can

216
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:23,830
keep some money out of politics.
That's what we need.

217
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,040
And here's some examples of how we can
get there from where we are.

218
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,100
Here are the the a checks and balances
we want to put in place on,

219
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,170
on corporations.

220
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,880
Here's what to do with campaign finance
here.

221
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,360
Here's what we want to do with schools
here.

222
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,550
Some of my ideas,
but I want to Gary Johnson to say,

223
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:41,470
you know,
all those things are problems,

224
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,690
but I think that maybe a little more
freedom as opposed to a little more

225
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:49,630
control from the government might give
us a lot of that.

226
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,490
I want individuals to have a little more
money in their pockets and use that for

227
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:58,360
charity and use that for building.
And I think instead of putting up

228
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,690
tariffs to keep foreigners foreign
businesses out,

229
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,840
uh,
we can actually make America more

230
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:06,230
competitive,
uh,

231
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,600
less of less taxes and let them have
more power that way and be more

232
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,420
successful and to be more money all over
the place.

233
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:18,220
We can take care of people.
I think that will work pretty well.

234
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:21,340
And while we're at it,
we'll stop the corporations by not

235
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:23,350
having a big government,
the flows money to them.

236
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,230
And then Bernie Sanders says back,
you know,

237
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,110
that sounds really good,
gary really does.

238
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,740
But there are some people who just plain
are going to be left out.

239
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,460
They're not gonna make it.
They're just not going to make it in

240
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:40,930
your Doggie dog free market economy.
You just got a little willing to throw

241
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:42,440
them away.
And then Gary says,

242
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:43,274
well,
you know,

243
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,550
maybe a,
a

244
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,940
maybe a subsistence amount of money for
everybody.

245
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,590
Maybe just get paid.
Just give him that money cause you know,

246
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:54,800
compare to what we're playing for food
stamps and all of that stuff.

247
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,660
Just writing them a check as much
easier.

248
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,750
So maybe we can do that.
And Bernie says,

249
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:02,750
you know what you're saying about
keeping businesses over here kind of

250
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:04,190
makes sense.
Uh,

251
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,490
Gary,
maybe we can do a few left less tariffs

252
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,860
and a little lower taxes to help our
corporations.

253
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,470
And maybe that'll help a little bit.
And they go back and forth and they cope

254
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,000
with an impasse where they don't agree.
And then the American people say,

255
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:21,290
you know,
let's try it Bernie's way for awhile.

256
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,800
Let's give it four years of burning
because it seems like he,

257
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,630
he's got some ideas.
Let's go.

258
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:27,920
Four years of burning.
You know,

259
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,330
Gary,
you're a good guy.

260
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:33,050
You thought about this really hard and
he made a really good case and we know

261
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:34,120
you're a good guy.
We like,

262
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:36,680
can we trust you?
But we're going with burning now.

263
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,250
And we tried that for awhile and is
Bernie's doing this?

264
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:42,020
There's other people in the government
that go,

265
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,040
what about this?
And he pulls back on this and he adjusts

266
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,630
and he does that.
And then he comes,

267
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,740
uh,
you know,

268
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,910
four years go by and the country goes,
let's hear that debate again.

269
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,180
Maybe someone else in place,
but whatever the hear the debate again

270
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:56,691
and they go,
you know,

271
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:59,330
we tried.
We don't really feel your burn.

272
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,480
Now feel my Johnson.
We'll have,

273
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,810
we'll have Gary Johnson take over for
four years.

274
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:09,140
See how that goes.
And you go back and forth and you have a

275
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:14,000
discussion of what we want to do as a
country between two good,

276
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,940
honest,
hard thinking human beings.

277
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:20,810
And please let's get one of them to be a
woman by the next time we do this

278
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:23,240
please.
And let's get someone to be of color.

279
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,900
Please.
Let's just do that.

280
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,780
We've got plenty of people on both sides
that aren't just white guys.

281
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,760
But for right now,
my example,

282
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,680
uh,
Bernie and,

283
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,640
and,
and Gary,

284
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,770
and we go back and forth like that.
Why aren't we doing that?

285
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:45,430
Why do we have two people that all they
agree on is that they should have power

286
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,570
to psychotic power,
hungry,

287
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:55,100
hated,
unpleasant people clawing and scratching

288
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,320
to take power over other people's lives?

289
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,610
Why not two people who are actually
having a discussion about what direction

290
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:03,560
our country should go in?
And by the way,

291
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,450
we're never going to go all the way,
Bernie.

292
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,340
We're never going to go all the way,
Gary.

293
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,730
But that's the discussion we have and
let that go.

294
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,910
So that is what I think about modern
politics.

295
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,250
And that's when I think about
libertarianism.

296
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,280
Yeah.
Maybe someday in the future we should go

297
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:23,870
to and arco capitalism.
Maybe someday in the future we should go

298
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:26,900
to full out socialism.
But for right now,

299
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,760
can we just do what every mother fucking
American believes,

300
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,880
which is stop giving so much money to
the corporations.

301
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,570
Let the people have more control,
let them spoke dope.

302
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,880
Let them put what they want into their
bodies.

303
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,270
Let them have sex with whoever they want
as long as there's consent.

304
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,440
And let them do that in every state.
Let them love who they want and enjoy

305
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:50,270
life the way they want.
Life,

306
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,370
liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.

307
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,810
Is that enough position?
