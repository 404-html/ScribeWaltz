1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,050
My name is Sherman Alexie and on the
bantamweight champion of the world.

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,741
Uh,
no,

3
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:11,760
I'm a writer,
poet,

4
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,380
short story writer,
novelist,

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,300
screenwriter.
You're young bastard.

6
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:20,710
I'm doing okay.
Uh,

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,900
uh,
it is a strange dilemma because in some

8
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:25,734
sense,
you know,

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,590
I was very negative,
very native identified and I still am,

10
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:32,580
but that's almost become secondary.
I've sort of joined the tribe of highly

11
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:34,740
established literary writers.
So,

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,780
you know,
I'm with Jonathan Franzen's of the

13
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:37,870
world.
Uh,

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,753
you know,
we,

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,700
I know I'm a little bit,
but that's sort of my peer group now

16
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,550
rather than this sort of,
you know,

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,650
Indian world literary world.
I'm now in this sort of

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,660
make believe world of writers who
supposedly hang out a lot,

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,160
although none of us ever do.
So I'm in,

20
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,810
I'm in a community of riders,
highly successful literary writer is

21
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,230
now.
Oh,

22
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,070
it's all.
I mean,

23
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:08,370
I haven't changed anything I've written
based on all that stuff.

24
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:11,940
So the perceptions of me may have
changed or the my career,

25
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:15,810
but I'm still writing the same stuff.
It's still pretty much about spokane,

26
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:19,380
Indian males stumbling through live.
So,

27
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,800
uh,
I think it's because of the combination

28
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,810
of skills I have,
you know,

29
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:26,610
I work in multigenre is,
um,

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,650
you know,
I do stand up comedy.

31
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:32,190
I helped make movies.
I think all of that has contributed to

32
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:35,070
it.
I'm not just a novelist or not just a

33
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:37,380
short story writer.
So I think,

34
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:40,590
uh,
in this highly technological world with

35
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:45,591
many diverse and diffuse influences,
I think I'm able to hit a lot of bases.

36
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,840
Nobody who's ever been poor,
whatever,

37
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:53,420
use the phrase selling out,
uh,

38
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,830
uh,

39
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,063
wow.

40
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,571
You know,
you know,

41
00:01:57,571 --> 00:02:02,550
my influences and the genre artists come
from my Indian writing ancestors,

42
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,790
the previous generation when you're
talking James Welch,

43
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,410
Simon Artese,
Scott Momaday,

44
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:09,300
joy Harjo,
Leslie Silko,

45
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,850
Linda Hogan,
Adrian St Louis,

46
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:16,350
all of these writers were multigenre.
They all wrote poetry and novels and

47
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:20,730
short stories and nonfiction and dabbled
in song writing and filmmaking and

48
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:25,470
documentary making.
So my original influences were native

49
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:28,330
American multigenre artists.
Uh,

50
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,520
now these days the younger native
writers are not multigenre.

51
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,860
So it's very interesting.
I'm not sure what's happening,

52
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:38,400
why that has changed,
but I grew up as a kid writer.

53
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,280
Uh,
nobody ever told me I was supposed to be

54
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:44,460
one thing,
so just because I've happened to become

55
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:49,230
successful in a number of those genres,
it wasn't because I was pursuing them

56
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,170
economically,
it was because I saw the artistic

57
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:55,590
possibilities in all of it.
And I was taught that was when I was a

58
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,690
19 year old undergraduate.

59
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,370
Yeah.
I think I'm the least educated Indian

60
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:05,270
writer out there.
Uh,

61
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,010
yeah,
I've been,

62
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,780
I've taught at the University of
Washington,

63
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,970
so,
but I'm not a good teacher.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,150
So I think that probably disqualifies
me.

65
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,630
Uh,
yeah.

66
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,520
I'm not in academia at all.
Uh,

67
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,640
in terms of a full time career.
Uh,

68
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,810
I think it's interesting because I think
when you look at native American

69
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:27,430
literature,
you're going to find that it doesn't

70
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:31,000
really reflect the diversity of the ways
in which the writers actually live their

71
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,010
lives.
Nobody has ever written,

72
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:34,770
for instance,
in academic farce,

73
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,520
a native American teacher at college
forest,

74
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,040
which is a time honored and wonderful
genre.

75
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,250
You know,
David Lodge made a whole career out of

76
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:44,200
it,
writing economic forces.

77
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:44,891
And I,
you know,

78
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,760
every,
every writer you can name as written it,

79
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,230
but we haven't done it,
uh,

80
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,420
you know,
whereas that novel about that Indian

81
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:54,940
architect or that Indian lawyer,
uh,

82
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,810
there's a distinct lack of white collar,
native American literature,

83
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:03,370
despite the fact that most of it's most
visible practitioners are white collar

84
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:05,260
themselves.
So,

85
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,050
uh,
I think there's an effort,

86
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,860
a somewhat of an insecurity that to
prove your indianness by focusing almost

87
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,720
entirely on our reservation based
identity.

88
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,150
I think it's old fashioned actually,
you know,

89
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:25,900
I think people think it's something new.
But the idea of being a storyteller,

90
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,600
you know,
for most of our existence was not

91
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,480
related to books.
It was about the ability to stand up in

92
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:33,220
front of the fire and,
you know,

93
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,140
earn your supper.
Uh,

94
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,440
so I think it's just something old and
inspired in me,

95
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:41,740
but I never really was the funny guy
growing up.

96
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,830
If you'd asked my siblings,
they tell you I was the depressed guy in

97
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:46,390
the basement.
But,

98
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:48,040
uh,
there the funny ones,

99
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,780
but,
uh,

100
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,250
it just,
I got on stage and started talking and

101
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:54,610
people laughed at the beginning.
I didn't even necessarily know what was

102
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:56,320
happening,
uh,

103
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,880
but as the years have gone on,
I realized that a humorous,

104
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:04,690
pretty amazing in its ability to
transcend differences politically,

105
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:06,070
ethnically,
racially,

106
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,380
geographically,
economically.

107
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,080
Uh,
there's something about it that really

108
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:13,090
opens people up spiritually,
I think.

109
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,960
And they listen.
They pay attention and it's also a great

110
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:18,880
way to offend people.
Uh,

111
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,060
I don't know.
We've all been to literary readings,

112
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,180
you know,
where we got theater but so bored by the

113
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:30,070
person up in front of us reading their
work so dispassionately that it nearly

114
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:32,400
turns us off their books.
Uh,

115
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,140
you know,
there are writers who I've heard do

116
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:38,740
their work that I could only hear their
voice when I'm reading their books and

117
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,770
it's so disinterested in their own stuff
and I just never wanted to do that.

118
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,420
Uh,
I wanted to make the mistake the other

119
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:47,320
way,
you know,

120
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,430
I'm pleased when somebody is offended by
my large stage presence because there's

121
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:56,350
still people who show up will get
offended.

122
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,970
Uh,
I get up there and give a show and I'm

123
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:00,320
improvising and,
you know,

124
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,950
talking about current events and what
happened yesterday or what happened an

125
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:05,930
hour ago,
what happened five minutes before I

126
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:07,820
walked into the place,
you know,

127
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:10,480
and giving people a glimpse of how my,
you know,

128
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,210
crazy mind works and then they'll come
up after me and said,

129
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:15,890
well,
I'm really disappointed you didn't read

130
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:16,724
the story.

131
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,950
And,
and you look at them and think,

132
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,870
well,
you can read this story.

133
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,790
You know,
what happened tonight will only happen

134
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:23,530
once,
you know,

135
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,550
you were here for one time thing.
Uh,

136
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,200
so I guess people are trapped in their
perceptions of what a literary artist is

137
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:31,040
supposed to be.

138
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,671
Uh,
you know,

139
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:38,240
I write poems naturally.
I'm writing them all the time.

140
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:42,890
I think it's more of a reflex talent
than fiction is for me.

141
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,770
It seems like I have to work harder to
write fiction.

142
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,460
Uh,
that sad poems are much more demanding.

143
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:52,910
You have fewer words,
you can make fewer mistakes.

144
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,390
And if you write a 10 line poem,
you really can't make any mistakes.

145
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,880
If you do,
the poem is terrible.

146
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,110
You know,
when you write a novel,

147
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:03,140
you have all that space to mess up in
and people are more forgiving.

148
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,630
So,
uh,

149
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,020
I think poetry audiences are far more
demanding than fiction and audiences are

150
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,830
well,
you know,

151
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,910
writers generally come in two groups,
those who love what they do and those

152
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:19,260
who can't stand what they do.
Um,

153
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,550
in the second group,
I have a really difficult time looking

154
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:23,810
back.
Uh,

155
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,740
yeah.
So I figure out of the thousands of

156
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:31,700
pages I published,
there's probably about 100 great pages.

157
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,550
I think I worked on probably about a two
percent greatness rate.

158
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,900
Uh,
so there's probably 10 poems to stories

159
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:43,901
that are great and the rest of it is
from anywhere from pretty good to know

160
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,900
total crap,
you know,

161
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:52,901
the book is not played out.
The idea of what a book can be is not

162
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:56,940
played out in its form as it is with
paper and covers and um,

163
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,130
and there are things that can be,
that digital will never touch.

164
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,860
And that's one of the things I wanted to
do with this,

165
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,840
uh,
and comparing it to a cassette tape,

166
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,210
the old fashioned way of making a mix
tape,

167
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:09,050
which,
you know,

168
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,010
I love burning cds too,
but there is something far more

169
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:17,540
passionate and hands on and hard work
about making a mix tape on a cassette.

170
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,610
A,
it's too easy to revise with a CD.

171
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,450
And today's technology makes it too easy
to,

172
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,940
to,
to change immediately.

173
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,080
You can cover your mistakes quicker.
I,

174
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,013
I think,
uh,

175
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,070
I think it allows you to have this sheen
of perfection around yourself,

176
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,660
uh,
and with,

177
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,910
uh,
an old fashioned book or an old

178
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:44,540
fashioned cassette tape,
you can actually see all the flaws and

179
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,760
imperfections and the bad choices.
Uh,

180
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,760
and I think there's something we lose
with technology when you talk about bad

181
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:53,594
choices.

182
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,290
They cost $300.
Number one,

183
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,860
I don't think anything that costs $300
can be called the gala perion.

184
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,120
Uh,
you know,

185
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,870
how much of the world can afford a $300
reading device?

186
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:12,010
A one percent of one percent of one
percent that automatically qualifies for

187
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,950
economically elite status.
Uh,

188
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:15,950
but what,
what,

189
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,600
what's really going on here,
the reading public doesn't really know

190
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,480
about all they're concerned about and
all their defending is they're reading

191
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:24,270
convenience,
which I completely understand whether

192
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:28,710
it's because of physical disability or
because of personal preference or just

193
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:30,990
the newness of it,
why they love a digital book,

194
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:34,350
but they don't understand the economic
corporate pressures going on in the

195
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:36,900
publishing world and what's going to
happen.

196
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:38,700
And this is going to happen on the
Internet to,

197
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,160
uh,
we like to pretend that the internet is

198
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:42,510
free.
Uh,

199
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,460
you know,
we like to pretend it's an open source

200
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:45,150
culture.

201
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,190
But as culture changes,
as corporate,

202
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,250
old corporate models of distributing
information are changing,

203
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,400
you know,
I don't know why people assumed that

204
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:57,360
corporations aren't going to take over
this medium as well because they can.

205
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,531
And,
and,

206
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,580
uh,
uh,

207
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,150
so what's happening in the book world,
the digital books,

208
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:05,580
is that these ebook companies,
you know,

209
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,380
Amazon,
Barnes and noble,

210
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:11,880
others that are rising a,
they just don't seek to published books.

211
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,470
They're going to end up seeking the
books to be chosen to be published.

212
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,170
So,
uh,

213
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,120
this economic model,
the way it's set up now is going to

214
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:26,121
favor a certain kind of book a and
publishers and being economically

215
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:32,520
motivated companies are only going to be
publishing those kinds of books and the

216
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:37,521
divide between pop culture,
pop writing and literary writing.

217
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,920
Is this going to increase and increase
and increase and it's gonna make it

218
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:45,000
harder and harder and harder for first
time writers to get published in any

219
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:46,770
form whatsoever where they'll get
attention,

220
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,680
who can find you,
uh,

221
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,150
who,
who's gonna find anybody.

222
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,430
Nobody's really risen out of the
Internet to become a major voice.

223
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,830
Uh,
they always end up getting a book

224
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:04,320
published and then the book makes them a
major voice.

225
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,090
Uh,
but nobody has.

226
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:06,990
I mean,
uh,

227
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,820
I'm trying to think,
uh,

228
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,680
you know,
I'm not Internet averse at all.

229
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm doing this,
uh,

230
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,210
I mean I love the Internet,
but the fact is,

231
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:16,200
is that it's a giant,
giant,

232
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,220
unfiltered library which has the
strength and beauty,

233
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,150
but,
but it's impossible to find people and

234
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,700
you know,
what we end up doing anyways,

235
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:29,630
I go to about five sites,
uh,

236
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,770
you know,
and I think most people probably do the

237
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:34,160
same thing.
You create this little small town inside

238
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,180
the Internet and we end up in all these
little tiny separate communities.

239
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,970
Uh,
Joan Jett and interviewed Joan Jett,

240
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:44,190
she said about the music industry.
She said,

241
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:46,200
the thing that's missing now is
anticipation.

242
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,520
They said that nobody gets an a big line
outside of tower records anymore waiting

243
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:55,180
for that new stones album to drop.
And nobody stands in line outside of a

244
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,030
record store waiting to buy the tickets
for the WHO concert.

245
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,210
Uh,
there's a real lack of community on the

246
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,240
internet experience when it comes to art
and you can't tell me and it's not true

247
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,350
that communicating strictly through the
Internet forums community and the way

248
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:15,280
that being together does a,
you're missing all.

249
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:18,880
But one sense you don't smell paypal,
you don't really hear them,

250
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:20,530
you don't see him.
Uh,

251
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,220
and we're animals.
We're creatures of senses and the

252
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:26,800
Internet deprives you of many of those.
And,

253
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:27,634
and,
uh,

254
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,620
so,
uh,

255
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:32,110
I,
I know there's new art coming based on

256
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:34,870
this technology and some of it's
happening and it's exciting and

257
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:37,510
interesting,
but there's nothing wrong with the old

258
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:42,511
art and I always worry and you see it
with certain Internet folks,

259
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:46,960
the way in which they're completely
willing to jettison their past in the

260
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:50,110
pursuit of something new.
And that's what I'm worried about.

261
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,460
Well,
in order to write about the emotional

262
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:57,040
state of a character,
I have to get as close as possible to

263
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:01,300
being in that emotional state.
So I have to get that sad.

264
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:03,400
I have to get that happy,
that crazed,

265
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,320
that bizarre,
that obsessed,

266
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,540
you know,
whatever one of my characters are going

267
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,310
through,
I have to find my way into it.

268
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,730
Uh,
you know,

269
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,170
it's just,
it's just the way I do it.

270
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,750
There's a story in this book called the
Ballad of Paul nonetheless,

271
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:24,751
where he becomes so obsessed with pop
music and so obsessed with his ipod and

272
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,333
that he,
he,

273
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,183
he,
you know,

274
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,300
every thought he has,
this can become directly related to a

275
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:33,820
song.
So I went that far into it.

276
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:37,450
I,
I tried to talk only in song lyrics.

277
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,040
Uh,
you know,

278
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,220
whenever anybody was talking to me,
I drove my friends and family mad

279
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,190
because whenever they would talk to me,
you know,

280
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,711
I would say,
well,

281
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:46,230
that reminds me of this,
you know,

282
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:50,020
a rolling stones song or,
or whenever anybody said something

283
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,660
accidentally that was a lyric or a title
of a song,

284
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:54,010
I would then sing the song.

285
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,400
So it was crazy.
But it got me seeing the way it was

286
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:03,940
completely alienating.
My friends and family really got me to a

287
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:08,030
place where I could write that story
about this really genial guy who's

288
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:13,050
actually very much an anti hero,
a case of beer a day.

289
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,010
Uh,
you know,

290
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,730
I could drink a fifth of Tequila a day.
Uh,

291
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,690
you know,
it becomes a drinking problem when it

292
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:25,720
affects your relationships with people,
uh,

293
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,500
when it affects your job or your school,
your grade point average,

294
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,590
uh,
uh,

295
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,770
you know,
affects your,

296
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,730
it's a drinking problem when you're
sitting on your couch at home,

297
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:40,480
drinking a case of beer all by yourself
and then you pass out and grabbed the

298
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:44,410
fifth of Tequila when you wake up.
So it's pretty obvious what my problem

299
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:45,244
was.

300
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,320
I wrote the lone ranger and Tonto
fistfight in heaven and the business of

301
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:53,930
fancy dancing a while drunk and
drinking.

302
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:55,060
So,
uh,

303
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:55,470
there's,
uh,

304
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,610
there's certainly a lot to be said for
my desperate years.

305
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,640
My Alcoholic Year is my active alcoholic
years as being the source of some pretty

306
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,300
good work,
uh,

307
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,660
for being the source of the two books
that established and made my career.

308
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,980
Uh,
but the thing is,

309
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:12,440
it's unsustainable.
Uh,

310
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,100
you know,
if you are using substances to feel your

311
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:17,950
creativity,
uh,

312
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,810
you're going to have a very,
very short artistic life.

313
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,870
You're going to be a sprinter.
And,

314
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,680
and,
uh,

315
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,000
by and large I wanted to become a
marathon runner and I can only run the

316
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:31,490
marathon if I'm sober.
You Kill Your brain,

317
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,290
uh,
you know,

318
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,690
please try to find me the successful
drug user,

319
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,420
you know,
you know,

320
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,590
try to find me the high functioning
alcoholic,

321
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,780
you know,
career person,

322
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,690
and,
and you could probably find in their

323
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:51,180
work when they were drinking,
when they were a,

324
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,430
I bet you could look at the downfall of
some amazing writers who wrote a one or

325
00:15:56,431 --> 00:15:58,220
two great books and then just fell
apart.

326
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,800
I'm pretty sure that's a related to
alcohol consumption.

327
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,390
So it's unsustainable.
Uh,

328
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,010
you know,
it's sort of like the environment,

329
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,830
uh,
you can only pour so much pollutants

330
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:12,740
into it before the temperature changes
dramatically.

331
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,420
So I think a drug and alcohol abuse is
like the greenhouse effect for riders.

332
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:20,901
Well,
I mean,

333
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:21,970
I'm an alcoholic.
That's,

334
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,260
you know,
my family is filled with alcohol

335
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,150
alcoholics.
My tribe is filled with alcoholics.

336
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,120
The whole race is filled with
alcoholics.

337
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,850
It's a,
for those Indians who try to pretend

338
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:33,620
it's a stereotype,
they're in deep,

339
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:35,080
deep denial.
Uh,

340
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,510
it's an everyday part of my life and as
a writer I use that a to write about it,

341
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:44,210
you know,
partly for fictional purposes and

342
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,240
narrative purposes,
but partly what the social hope that by

343
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:50,750
writing about it,
maybe it'll help people get sober and it

344
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:51,980
has,
I've heard from them,

345
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,590
uh,
you know,

346
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,150
the social function of art is very
important to me.

347
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,090
Uh,
it's not just for art's sake.

348
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,980
Uh,
I have a very specific,

349
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,770
very specific ideas in mind about what
it can do.

350
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:08,771
I've seen it happen.
So it is writing about alcohol that

351
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:11,010
helps me stay sober.
Uh,

352
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,510
and I think reading about alcoholism
helps other people stay sober.

353
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,040
I try to meet deadlines
I have,

354
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,010
I have,
you know,

355
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,900
more dependence.
Uh,

356
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:24,980
so it's a very,
very,

357
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,360
uh,
basic triangle needs that bottom part of

358
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:30,470
the triangle.
But,

359
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:32,660
uh,
well they're always surprising me.

360
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:33,860
The kids are,
I surprisingly,

361
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,340
if their insights into the world and of
course because they're my children,

362
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:38,930
I pay more attention to what they're
saying.

363
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:41,000
Then pretty much everybody else on the
planet.

364
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,150
I care more what my kids say on a daily
basis.

365
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:44,811
Then,
you know,

366
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:47,070
the smartest people on the planet,
you know,

367
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,480
and so I listened and their insights are
really surprising and the way in which,

368
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,740
how unfiltered they are and,
and,

369
00:17:57,741 --> 00:18:00,060
uh,
their obsessions and passions,

370
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:03,720
they don't apologize for any of that.
So I learned a lot from them.

371
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,150
You know,
it's also aggravating and irritating and

372
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,470
exhausting,
uh,

373
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,590
the sacrifices you make and you know,
you know,

374
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,320
sometimes it feels like my whole life as
a to do list.

375
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,880
Uh,
but,

376
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,773
but,
uh,

377
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,730
you know,
I think their passion for life really as

378
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,840
reinspired me.

379
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,240
No I don't,
I mean they're,

380
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,540
they're,
they're autonomous.

381
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,090
I certainly,
if they want to read my stuff and talk

382
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:33,410
about it later,
that'll be great.

383
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:35,060
But until then,
uh,

384
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,380
it was so funny though.
I was profiled on the layer news hour

385
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:43,640
recently and I was watching the rough
cut of it and my son came down,

386
00:18:43,641 --> 00:18:46,430
my eight year old and he was watching it
on the TV with me and it was a five

387
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:49,970
minute piece about poetry and I read a
couple poems and I read one very

388
00:18:49,971 --> 00:18:52,910
emotional,
one of my father's death and it was over

389
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:54,590
and my son looked at me.
He's eight years old.

390
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,424
They looked at me.
He goes,

391
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,070
Dad,
you're pretty good.

392
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,360
So that was a great moment.
It's funny.

393
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:07,280
This popped into my head,
so I'll go with it.

394
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:09,780
Shoeless Joe Jackson,
uh,

395
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,920
who was banned from baseball in 1919 for
allegedly fixing the world series a

396
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,880
country boy ended up being a great
baseball player,

397
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:23,510
one of the greatest of all time.
I'd like to talk to them about that

398
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:26,990
world series about the mysteries of
human nature because,

399
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,730
you know,
you're looking at the stats.

400
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,810
It's,
I'm pretty sure he didn't participate in

401
00:19:32,811 --> 00:19:34,100
the fixed,
but he knew about it.

402
00:19:34,101 --> 00:19:36,500
So I'd like to have the discussion with
morality,

403
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:41,150
which she will list Joe Jackson.
Well,

404
00:19:41,151 --> 00:19:44,540
there are just certain poems and novels
and stories that resonate forever and

405
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,610
ever,
uh,

406
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,031
you know,
poems.

407
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:50,960
I always return to Emily Dickinson
because I could not stop for death that

408
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:52,220
kindly stopped for me.

409
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,320
Uh,
no

410
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,800
theater,
Rhett keys.

411
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:57,290
I know a woman,
you know,

412
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,360
I knew a woman,
lovely later bones when small birds side

413
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,713
back at them,

414
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,403
James,
right?

415
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,770
Suddenly I realized that if I stepped
outside my body,

416
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,310
I would break into blossom.
So,

417
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,690
uh,
and then,

418
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:14,410
you know,
I can,

419
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,810
you know,
the end of Grapes of Wrath when Rosa,

420
00:20:16,811 --> 00:20:19,270
Sharon breastfeeds,
her child has died,

421
00:20:19,271 --> 00:20:22,600
but she breastfeeds to starving man.
That moment.

422
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,080
Uh,
so it's always individual works.

423
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,080
Uh,
even in life I don't,

424
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,240
I don't have heroes,
I believe in heroic ideas because the

425
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:35,710
creators of all those ideas are very
human.

426
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,120
And if you make heroes out of people,
you invariably be disappointed

427
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,350
as her Jack Keats a snowy day.
The book,

428
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,780
you know,
the idea of multicultural literature is

429
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:53,290
very new.
And so as a little Indian boy growing up

430
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,930
on the reservation,
there was nobody like me in the books.

431
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,250
So you always had to extrapolate.
But when I picked up a snowy day with

432
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:05,251
that inner city Black Kid,
that child walking through the snow

433
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:09,220
covered pretty quiet and lonely city.
Oh,

434
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,050
I mean,
when he was making snow angels and you

435
00:21:12,051 --> 00:21:14,020
know,
when he was getting a snowball fights

436
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:16,090
and when he got home to his mother and
it was cold,

437
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:19,000
and if you put them in a hot bath tub
and put them to sleep,

438
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,910
the loneliness and the love in that
book.

439
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,770
Oh,
just gorgeous.

440
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:27,190
So that picture book resonates with me
still.
