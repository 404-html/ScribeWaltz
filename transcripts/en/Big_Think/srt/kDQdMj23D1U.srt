1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,970
Yeah,

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,670
easily,
for example,

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,630
Jews,
the Jewish Egyptians were very,

4
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:21,240
very accepted.
The very prominent,

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,420
and I will give you some quick examples,
are the assistant of our Greek leader of

6
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:33,351
1990 revolution,
Sadza who was our group leader who made

7
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,390
the revolution against the British
occupation.

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,600
His assistant was Jewish,
Egyptian,

9
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,020
uh,
some of the founders of the Egyptian

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,320
economies war,
uh,

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,420
and that was our way to fight back
against the,

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,330
the English occupation to have our own
university and our own economy and our

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,600
own banks and the were Jewish families.
You see,

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,470
it was even some of the,
of the very,

15
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:09,471
very famous movie stars in Egypt.
The forties were Jews you see at the,

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,840
it was not even accepted to identify
Egyptians according to the religion that

17
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:23,421
was totally impolite to say,
or even to refeed that somebody ensure

18
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,110
Christian,
you'll see a,

19
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,240
there were options like any other
Egyptians who happened to be just like

20
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,270
the Egyptians who happen to be
Christians or Muslims.

21
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,450
So we had our very,
very great positive experience about

22
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:40,970
Jews with Jews.
And uh,

23
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,260
the problem with us was not.
The problem was was Israel,

24
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,730
you see,
and it is very dangerous to confuse the

25
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:54,480
two concepts.
I would say that some people in Israel

26
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,990
feel very comfortable to confuse,
to confuse,

27
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,960
to mix up the two,
uh,

28
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,140
concepts in the,
in the sense that if you are critical

29
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:09,141
against some Israeli policies,
so accordingly you are against Jews.

30
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,420
And this is terribly wrong,
terribly wrong.

31
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,220
You see,
because I am,

32
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,280
I believe that the,
I am very critical against the Saudi

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,170
regime and I believe it's a terrible
regime,

34
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,280
but this does not mean that I'm against
all Arabs or Muslims.

35
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,580
So I think that we never had a,
we never had really a problem or a

36
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:38,130
discrimination against Jews in the hole.
