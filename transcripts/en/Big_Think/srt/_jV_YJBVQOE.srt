1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,710
Okay,
as I mentioned,

2
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:08,100
I'm at Washington University,
which is in St Louis.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,020
It's actually quite a beautiful city.
I moved there from Oakland,

4
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:15,930
California was the place I had lived
before that and moving.

5
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:18,930
They're having only lived on both sides
of the country and never in the middle

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,080
and I guess moving in particular to the
city really opened my eyes to some of

7
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:27,780
the systemic racism that was apparent in
the city.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,620
It's a great place and it also has a big
divide,

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,310
in fact locally,
and I'm not sure if this goes on outside

10
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:38,220
of the city as well.
It's often referred to as the divided

11
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:42,270
city and there's even a line that
demarcates where that divide takes

12
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:44,580
place.
I live one block from that line and I

13
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:46,870
was seeing regularly,
um,

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,860
all kinds of things happened that were
really eyeopening to me.

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,320
Okay.
I think that the country's eyes got

16
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:57,180
opened even wider after Ferguson and
many other events that continue to

17
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:58,560
happen around the country.

18
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,450
I mean,
as a developmental psychologist,

19
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,310
I really took a lot of this to heart
because I was thinking about my kids and

20
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:09,570
the kids that I was seeing in my lab and
those kids that weren't coming into my

21
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:13,050
lab and then I know that lived across
that line and what should we,

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,720
could we potentially be doing both for
the kids,

23
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,260
but also looking at kids with some hope
for the future.

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,340
Now what we do know,
um,

25
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,190
sadly in children is that they're
already has implicit biases that you can

26
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:29,280
pick up and observing kids at five to
six years of age.

27
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,540
This is one example of a study that my
colleague Melanie killen did.

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,050
She is at University of Maryland,
so close to Baltimore.

29
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,730
And what she found is that different
children will interpret this scene,

30
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:43,700
these scenes very differently.
Okay.

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,840
And what she discovered in,
in this particular study is that black

32
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:53,841
kids actually are much more optimistic
about race than white kids already by

33
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,730
first grade,
which is the kid she tested in this

34
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:57,330
study.

35
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,690
The white kids were having much more
negative or pessimistic kinds of

36
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:04,290
interpretations than the black children
who are trying to have much more

37
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,110
positive interpretation and
interpretation that's positive,

38
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:07,944
for example,
will be like,

39
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,560
oh,
it looks like he fell off the off the

40
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:13,440
swing and the other kid was waiting to
see if he needed help.

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,770
Um,
a not so positive interpretation would

42
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:19,560
be something like,
I think he pushed him off the swing so

43
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:21,450
that he could use it.
Okay.

44
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,400
So what we were thinking about is how
might we go ahead and take action and be

45
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:29,190
looking at the kids,
what could we do earlier?

46
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,480
Are we already seeing that these biases
are developing already in the preschool

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,070
years?
What might we be doing?

48
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,960
Um,
other ways that we could step in and

49
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:38,120
intervene on this.
Okay.

50
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,630
So we know that babies notice
differences between people of all kinds.

51
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,190
Whether people speak different
languages,

52
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:46,950
have different color skin act
differently.

53
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,280
We also know that by three years of age,
children are already noticing power and

54
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:56,190
status differences and that by five or
six years of age,

55
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:58,320
as I said,
we're already seeing implicit biases

56
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:00,880
about these.
What is happening in the preschool

57
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,520
years,
and we wanted to ask a few questions.

58
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,190
I'm only going to show you two things
that we've been looking at this.

59
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,940
Okay.
Now our participants are.

60
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,880
Our kids that are in these studies are
at preschools all over the city of St

61
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,520
Louis.
I'm going to report today data that's

62
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:18,410
coming from kids that are on in racially
homogenous schools,

63
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:21,940
so their schools that are mostly all
black kids and black teachers or mostly

64
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:26,290
all white kids and white teachers,
but we're also testing at a number of

65
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,220
mixed schools that are in the city.
Most of the kids in the homogenous

66
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:34,990
schools also come from a pretty
homogenous neighborhoods of both races

67
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,600
and we put them in these two tasks,
accuracy task,

68
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:41,440
which is just having somebody named
those three objects and either saying

69
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:42,460
them accurately.

70
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,220
It's a cup,
it's a ball and it's a book or naming

71
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:47,560
them wrong inaccurately.
It's a pencil.

72
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,360
It's a fork and it's a shoe.
Okay,

73
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,070
and what we see in lots and lots of
studies previously by many colleagues of

74
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:58,630
mine and myself,
is that children prefer the person who

75
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,420
is accurate and they also refer to learn
from that person.

76
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,650
So we wanted to ask them,
here is all we did was change out the

77
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:10,180
race of one of these speakers and ask
them which one of these people would you

78
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:13,210
like to have as your teacher can.
We did that in accuracy tasks.

79
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,540
So one of these was always accurate and
one wasn't okay.

80
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,660
Then we also put them into a simple
teacher preference task.

81
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,210
We didn't give them any background
information.

82
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,240
We just asked which of these would you
like to have is your teacher.

83
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,860
And these were always different people.

84
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,360
I think I may have put the same faces
up,

85
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,900
but they're always different.
And what we found in these racially

86
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:36,340
homogenous schools is that both white
and black children were.

87
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,930
They wanted an accurate person to teach
them stuff and to be their teacher.

88
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,700
So it didn't matter.
Black,

89
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:44,920
white,
they wanted the accurate person.

90
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,870
That's who they wanted to be their
teacher.

91
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,210
However,
when we simply asked them,

92
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:51,550
which one of these people do you prefer
to be your teacher?

93
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,050
Both races have kids preferred the white
teacher.

94
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,780
I'll leave that there for a minute just
to sync.

95
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,100
These are three to six year old kids
now.

96
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,800
We also put them in a marshmallow task
with Eshkol range,

97
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,220
which has long been used to look at how
kids delay gratification.

98
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:10,930
That has all kinds of successful
outcomes,

99
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,720
but we wanted to look at something else
more recently.

100
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,990
Some findings have suggested that you
might get different effects in this

101
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:20,590
marshmallow test depending on how much
you trust that the speaker is going to

102
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:21,371
come back.
Okay,

103
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:25,630
so we wanted to use this as sort of a
measure of trust in the speaker and what

104
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,320
we did is present put kids again,
black or white kids,

105
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,650
and the only difference between them was
whether they got a black experimenter or

106
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:35,470
the wide experiment to do the
marshmallow task with them and this is

107
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:37,510
all they are.
They're sat down at a table in a room.

108
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,720
You're given a big,
enticing marshmallow and they're told

109
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,050
just wait,
I'm going to be back and if you don't

110
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:46,120
eat that before I get back,
I'm going to actually give you another

111
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:49,180
marshmallow so you'll have to buy and
they leave the room.

112
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,790
They're being filmed in there,
so we see what's going on and we know

113
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:56,791
how long they waited and what we found
again is that black waited exactly same

114
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:01,130
amount of time.
Didn't matter if the experimenter was

115
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:03,500
white or black.
The white kids,

116
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,950
we did significantly longer if the
experimenter was white.

117
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,250
Okay.
Both of these things suggest to us that

118
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:13,760
there is already something going on
starting at three years of age and up

119
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,330
and that there's a lot of work that
needs to be done to the snip these in

120
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:20,720
the bud while we still have these kids
before other things can be happening.

121
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,520
Okay?
Um,

122
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,130
now we are testing at mixed race
schools.

123
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,520
I'm hoping that some of this will come
out a little bit differently,

124
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,630
but we will learn from that and see what
exposure and interaction can do.

125
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,250
We do know that cross race friendship is
one of the best predictors of a lessened

126
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,850
bias across races and other social
groups.

127
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,760
Okay.
Quickly because I know I need to wrap

128
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:47,300
up.
I just want to present this idea that

129
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,500
what it must be like I'm in a world and
what if kids,

130
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,210
when when you are a minority and
everything isn't presented to look like

131
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:58,250
you.
This is what a black child typically

132
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,920
feels like when they go to the store to
pick her doll or when they go to the

133
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,640
bookstore to look at books,
looking for examples of things that

134
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:05,930
represent me,
that are like me,

135
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:08,570
that I can relate with,
that I can learn from and relate to.

136
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,520
And so what if white kids had that same
kind of understanding and it gave them a

137
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:18,521
better way or a more clear view of what
the world was like.

138
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,080
Okay.
Now there is one such organization that

139
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:23,060
I've been really lucky to partner with
in St Louis.

140
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:25,910
It's called stories and stories.

141
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,940
Is is introducing white families and
mixed race families to um,

142
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,720
more diverse books and helping parents
have conversations about race in their

143
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,960
home.
A black families tend to have much more

144
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:42,980
conversation about race because they
need to then white families that tend to

145
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:46,400
have difficulty talking about these
issues with their kids even if they're

146
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:49,130
well intended and want to.
It's challenging so they're giving them

147
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:51,680
the books and the resources with which
to do this.

148
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,550
And this is already really taking fire
and there's a huge wait list.

149
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:59,840
They've already worked with I think 500
and something families in the St Louis

150
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:03,020
area and there's 400 or so families,
at least on the waitlist.

151
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,470
They can't move along as fast as I can.
So I've partnered with them both as

152
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,530
member in the program,
but also I'm doing some of the research

153
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,230
to see the effect of exposure,
um,

154
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:14,540
through diverse exposure to diversity
through books.

155
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,760
If that can have any kind of impact and
change.

156
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,360
One important thing about this program
is that not only is as opposed to impact

157
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:22,340
the kids,
but it already has and we see the

158
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:26,060
effects of it impacting the parents so
that parents caring about this,

159
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:30,200
it's making them much more committed to
seeing change in the region and making

160
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:32,090
sure that their kids grow up thinking
differently.

161
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:37,210
I'll leave you soon with a quote from
Baldwin who said that I can't be a

162
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:41,180
pessimist because I'm alive.
To be a pessimist means that you have

163
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:43,550
agreed that human life is an academic
matter.

164
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,970
So I'm forced to be an optimist.
I'm forced to believe that we can

165
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:49,820
survive whatever it is we must survive.
Okay?

166
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,750
But we don't have to survive everything.
Some of the things we need to figure out

167
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,030
and we can change them.
I really have.

168
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,120
I'm having the audacity of hope for
racial equity,

169
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,370
uh,
to keep moving forward.

170
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,130
And I want to leave with this quote,
which is,

171
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,930
um,
when I was struggling not only with the

172
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:11,940
things that were going on in my city,
around me,

173
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,560
but then the,
uh,

174
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,410
campaigns and elections last year.
Sometimes I say,

175
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,690
why should we do anything?
There's no hope.

176
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,690
There's,
and this gave me some hope,

177
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,540
actually some optimism.
And if you can't read it,

178
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,460
there's one of his little creatures that
saying,

179
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,800
why so optimistic?
About 2017.

180
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,350
What do you think it will bring?
The other one says,

181
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:34,290
I think it will bring flowers.
Yes.

182
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,320
How come?
Because I am planting flowers and what

183
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:44,220
optimism can do is give us the faith
that eventually takes us to seeing some

184
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:46,440
improvement to seeing some achievement.
Okay.

185
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,220
Nothing is going to be able to be done
without the ability for us to be able to

186
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:53,910
imagine what isn't there,
how things could be changed or imagine

187
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:57,840
the ways in which things aren't already.
And that requires hope.

188
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,480
So for hope and optimism.
Um,

189
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,610
this is my view of how these come
together.

190
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,140
And I ask that you planted lots of
flowers.
