1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,490
Well,
there really are very few countries left

2
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:15,140
in the world that are capable of adding
to the world supply of oil.

3
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:17,960
Most of the oil producers now are in
decline,

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,990
so that handful of countries that are
able to increase oil are Azerbaijan and

5
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:29,351
Kazakhstan and the Caspian Sea area may
be Iraq in the Persian Gulf.

6
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:36,731
And we know what problems are faced in
Iraq and then Africa,

7
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,470
Algeria,
Libya,

8
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:41,240
Sudan,
and Gola,

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,300
Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria.
And not too many other countries really

10
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,580
may be Venezuela,
maybe Columbia,

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,940
but that's about it.
