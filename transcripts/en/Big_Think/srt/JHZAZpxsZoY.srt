1
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,530
You know,
the book is not played out,

2
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,440
the idea of what a book can be is not
played out in its form as it is with

3
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:20,460
paper and covers and um,
and there are things that can be,

4
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:24,630
that digital will never touch and that's
one of the things I wanted to do with

5
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:27,060
this and comparing it to a cassette
tape,

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,430
the old fashioned way of making a mix
tape,

7
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:30,264
which,
you know,

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,260
I love burning cds too,
but there is something far more

9
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:38,790
passionate and hands on and hard work
about making a mix tape on a cassette.

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,370
A,
it's too easy to revise with a CD and

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,040
today's technology makes it too easy to,
to,

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,650
to change immediately.
Uh,

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,220
you can cover your mistakes quicker.
I,

14
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:53,911
th,
I think,

15
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:56,640
uh,
I think it allows you to have the sheen

16
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:59,340
of perfection around yourself.
Uh,

17
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,180
and with a old fashioned book or an old
fashioned cassette tape,

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,130
you can actually see all the flaws and
imperfections and the bad choices.

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,210
Uh,
and I think there's something we lose

20
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:14,580
with technology when you talk about bad
choices

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,530
like costs $300,
number one,

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,180
I don't think anything that costs $300
can be called egalitarian.

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,210
You know,
how much of the world can afford a $300

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,260
reading device,
a one percent of one percent of one

25
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:35,700
percent that automatically qualifies for
economically elite status.

26
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,340
But what we're,
what's really going on here,

27
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:41,280
the reading public doesn't really know
about all they're concerned about and

28
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:43,590
all their defending is they're reading
convenience,

29
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,400
which I completely understand whether
it's because of physical disability or

30
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:50,940
because of personal preference or just
the newness of it,

31
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:53,880
why they love a digital book,
but they don't understand the economic

32
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,660
corporate pressures going on in the
publishing world and what's going to

33
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:59,190
happen.
And this is going to happen on the

34
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:00,500
Internet to,
uh,

35
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,880
we liked to pretend that the internet is
free.

36
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,021
Uh,
you know,

37
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:06,330
we like to pretend it's an opensource
culture.

38
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,430
But as culture changes,
as corporate,

39
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,490
old corporate models of distributing
information are changing,

40
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,640
you know,
I don't know why people assume that

41
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:18,570
corporations aren't going to take over
this medium as well because they can.

42
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,771
And,
and,

43
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:20,820
uh,
uh,

44
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,500
so what's happening in the book world
digital books is that these ebook

45
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,820
companies,
you know,

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,650
Amazon,
Barnes and noble,

47
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:33,090
others that are rising a,
they just don't seek to publish books.

48
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,710
They're going to end up seeking the
books to be chosen to be published.

49
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,190
So,
uh,

50
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,360
this economic model,
the way it's set up now is going to

51
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:47,361
favor a certain kind of book a and
publishers and being economically

52
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:53,760
motivated companies are only going to be
publishing those kinds of books and the

53
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:58,761
divide between pop culture,
pop writing and literary writing.

54
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:01,510
Is this going to increase and increase
and increase?

55
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,260
And it's going to make it harder and
harder and harder for first time writers

56
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:08,050
to get published in any form whatsoever
where they'll get attention,

57
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,940
who can find you,
uh,

58
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,410
who,
who's going to find anybody.

59
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,080
Uh,
nobody's really arisen out of the

60
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:21,410
Internet to become a major voice.
Uh,

61
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,740
they always end up getting a book
published and then the book makes them a

62
00:03:24,741 --> 00:03:27,320
major voice,
but nobody has.

63
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:28,230
I mean,
uh,

64
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,050
I'm trying to think,
uh,

65
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,910
you know,
I'm not Internet averse at all.

66
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,260
I'm doing this,
uh,

67
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:35,460
I mean I love the Internet,
but the fact is,

68
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:37,460
is that it's a giant,
giant,

69
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,660
unfiltered library,
which,

70
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,630
which has the strength and beauty,
but it's impossible to find people.

71
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,430
And you what we ended up doing anyways,
I go to about five sites,

72
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,540
uh,
you know,

73
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,540
and I think most people probably do the
same thing.

74
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:58,380
You create this little small town inside
the Internet and we end up in all of

75
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,560
these little tiny separate communities.

76
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,230
Uh,
Joan Jett and interview with Joan Jett,

77
00:04:03,231 --> 00:04:06,530
she said about the music industry.
She said the thing that's missing now is

78
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,740
anticipation.
They see said that nobody gets in a big

79
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:13,190
line outside of tower records anymore,
waiting for that new stones album to

80
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:16,430
drop.
And nobody stands in line outside or a

81
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,250
record store waiting to buy the tickets
for the WHO concert.

82
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,000
Uh,
there's a real lack of community on the,

83
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,381
uh,
you know,

84
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:27,620
in the Internet experience when it comes
to art and you can't tell me and it's

85
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:32,090
not true that communicating strictly
through the Internet forums community

86
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:37,091
and the way that being together does a,
you're missing all but one sense.

87
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,120
You don't smell people,
you don't really hear him,

88
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:41,700
you don't see him.
Uh,

89
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,440
and we're animals.
We're creatures of senses and the

90
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:48,050
Internet deprives you of many of those.
And,

91
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,913
and,
uh,

92
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,840
so,
uh,

93
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,360
I,
I know there's new art coming based on

94
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:56,120
this technology and some of it's
happening and it's exciting and

95
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:58,760
interesting,
but there's nothing wrong with the old

96
00:04:58,761 --> 00:05:02,570
art.
And I always worry and you see it with

97
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:05,060
certain Internet folks,
the way in which they're completely

98
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:09,380
willing to jettison their past and the
pursuit of something new.

99
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,330
And that's what I'm worried about.
