1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,790
I had been a journalist for about eight
and a half years.

2
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:08,880
I was kind of an accidental journalist.
I never really intended to be a

3
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:10,260
journalist side.
Uh,

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,470
was fortunate enough to fall into a job
at the New York times when I got out of

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,960
college.
And it was a great experience when

6
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:19,530
you're in your twenties to see the world
and meet interesting people and be

7
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:23,250
involved with interesting issues.
But as time went on,

8
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:24,480
I said to myself,
you know,

9
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:26,940
I never really thought about what I
wanted to do with my life.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,700
Um,
I'd like to see what it's like in effect

11
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:33,180
on the other side of the curtain to see
what it's like to actually be the one

12
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:35,370
doing the deals,
not just writing about the deals.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,730
And so I decided as kind of an
experiment to go try it,

14
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:41,310
thinking I would do it for a couple of
years and if it didn't work out,

15
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:43,070
if I wasn't any good at it,
if I,

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,290
if I didn't like it,
I could come back to journalism and I

17
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,880
ended up staying 25 years.

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,950
I think journalism today is in a very
interesting place.

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,470
Uh,
I wrote in my book about some of my

20
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:02,370
grievances being on,
on the other side of the line from the

21
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:06,630
journalist in terms of how I think
journalism has changed in the 30 years,

22
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,990
roughly since I was in Washington as a
journalist,

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
um,
where I think it has become much more

24
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:14,580
game of spinning and being spun much
more game of.

25
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:16,290
Gotcha.
Um,

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,500
and I think all of that is part of why
the tonality in our society is pretty

27
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,130
rough at the moment.
I think.

28
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,300
I don't blame journalists for all of it.
Uh,

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,880
I don't blame the government for all of
it,

30
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:29,580
but I think there is a shared
responsibility that right now isn't

31
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:31,440
being discharged.
Uh,

32
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:33,800
and I think there's been a bit of a
dumbing down of journalism.

33
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,420
I think the whole sound byte journalism,
uh,

34
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:39,060
the blogosphere,
the cable,

35
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,090
the hyperventilated,
cable TV journalism,

36
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:46,050
I'm not sure how great any of that is,
but I was just a few minutes ago having

37
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:48,480
a conversation with someone about the
other side of the coin,

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,620
which is you had this enormous pro
proliferation of journalistic outlets,

39
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:56,730
like big thing that didn't exist,
couldn't exist a few years ago.

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,190
And so in the course of trying to sell
my book,

41
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,170
I've been interviewed by all kinds of
media outlets that didn't exist and as I

42
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:06,060
said,
couldn't have existed a few years ago

43
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,820
and in,
in a way that's a kind of golden age of

44
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:12,630
journalism that there are so many more
ways now to communicate and learn

45
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:15,420
things.
So I certainly wouldn't hesitate to tell

46
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:18,240
a friend or a child to go into
journalism,

47
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,080
but I think you really have to pick your
spots and know what you're in for.

48
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,510
My whole career in finance was going
from bigger firms to smaller firms and

49
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,220
at each step,
step of the way,

50
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:36,420
all I wanted was to be part of a small
group of very talented people on every

51
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,720
firm.
I joined got bigger and so finally I

52
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,170
decided,
uh,

53
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,270
starting our own firm would be the next
great thing to do.

54
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:48,930
It was a point in time,
this was in the year 2000 when it was

55
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:51,390
relatively easy to start a firm.
There was a lot of capital,

56
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:54,810
there were a lot of investors around and
there's no,

57
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,830
there's no sense of accomplishment like
starting a firm or a business as I'm

58
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:04,420
sure you're finding a from scratch and
watching it succeed and grow and thrive.

59
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,320
If you want to be an entrepreneur,
which is a wonderful thing to aspire to,

60
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,630
you have to,
there are several things you have to

61
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:14,770
have.
First,

62
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,150
you have to be completely committed and
devoted to that enterprise or project or

63
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:21,460
whenever you take on.
It's not something to do in your spare

64
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:23,770
time.
It's not something to do while you have

65
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:25,540
a couple of other careers.
It's not something to do.

66
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,870
While you write your first novel,
it's something you've just got to do.

67
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,830
The second thing is you've got to have a
very strong constitution.

68
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,800
There will be bumps in the road,
there'll be ups and downs,

69
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,200
you,
they may well be complete failure.

70
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,140
Many entrepreneurial ventures fail.
Um,

71
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,690
you have to accept that that is part of
the game.

72
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,440
And failure is not the end of life.
It's not the end of the world.

73
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,840
Uh,
and you just have to be willing to roll

74
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:53,800
with the punches and take risks.
You have to basically be a risk taker.

75
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:58,330
Many people spend their entire careers
happily in established organizations

76
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:00,370
because they don't have the tolerance
for risk.

77
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,040
I frankly never thought I would have the
tolerance for risk.

78
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,920
I've always been part until we started
our firm of,

79
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,890
uh,
of an established large organization.

80
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,050
But having been part of now one startup,
I think there's nothing else quite like

81
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:14,801
it.
If it works,

82
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:16,600
and I could easily imagine doing
another.
