1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,700
Visual intelligence is the concept that
we see more than we can process and it's

2
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:17,160
the idea of thinking about what we see
taking in the information and what do we

3
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:21,000
really need to live our lives more
purposefully and do our jobs more

4
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:24,200
effectively.
What I asked the people in the art of

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,360
perception to do,
one of them is looking down at a piece

6
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:31,170
of paper and the other one is looking at
the painting and then they have one

7
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:34,800
minute to describe what it is that they
see to their partner and the partner has

8
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,520
to sketch what they hear and it's not
about the artwork.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,240
It's not about how well you draw.
It's how well can you describe a new set

10
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:45,750
of unfamiliar data?
How well do you listen and how well do

11
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:48,420
you take that articulation and transfer
it to your own language?

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,220
Yeah.

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,240
How many of you said there was a train
coming out of a fireplace and everyone

14
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:25,241
raises his or her hands and how many of
you referenced smoke or steam in your

15
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:28,850
discussion?
Lots of hands go up and then I asked the

16
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:32,210
question,
who mentioned who articulated that?

17
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:36,680
There are no tracks under the trade and
a few astute people actually raised

18
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:37,610
their hand and said,
no.

19
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:39,020
I said there were no tracks under the
train,

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,820
and then I asked who noticed and then
articulated that there was no fire in

21
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:46,820
the fireplace and hands go up,
not too many.

22
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,790
And then we talk about other aspects of
the painting.

23
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,610
How many people mentioned the woodgrain
on the floor.

24
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,980
Most people notice the wood grain on the
floor.

25
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,900
How many people mentioned wainscoting,
that kind of paneling on the walls,

26
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,390
and I always have some decorative arts
aficionados.

27
00:02:02,391 --> 00:02:02,820
Oh yes.

28
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,370
I know about wainscoting and then I say,
how many of you mentioned a mantle on

29
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:09,440
the fireplace?
Lots of hands go up.

30
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,860
Who mentioned candlesticks.
Lots of hands go up.

31
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,860
And then I asked,
how many of you said there were no

32
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:19,010
candles in the candlesticks?
And people say,

33
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:20,390
Oh nope.
Never got there.

34
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,560
And then I ask,
okay,

35
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:24,710
what really observant nerd said it's
1242 or eight.

36
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:25,700
Oh,
five on the clock.

37
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:29,780
Who got to mention the time?
And the reason I asked I have that line

38
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:34,700
of questioning is because this painting
illustrates a really very important

39
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:38,990
concept that I transferred from
emergency medicine to a much broader

40
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:42,380
application and the idea is called the
pertinent negative.

41
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,280
It's saying what isn't there in addition
to what is there to actually give a more

42
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:50,240
accurate picture of what you're looking
at.

43
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,200
So when you say I see a train coming out
of a fireplace,

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,700
and by the way there are no tracks under
the train and there is no fire in the.

45
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,620
Why would you attempt to say what's not
there?

46
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,340
Because in my third grade mind,
if you told me to draw a fireplace,

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,560
I would draw two sticks and a fire and
smoke in the fireplace unless you told

48
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:14,530
me not to.
And if you told me to draw a pair of

49
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:18,310
candlesticks,
I'll draw candles with flames unless you

50
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:21,640
tell me not to.
So the pertinent negative is this

51
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:26,080
wonderful concept that gives us a
broader way of looking at something.

52
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,490
Instead of looking at something like
this,

53
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:30,430
you look at it like this.
And here's the example,

54
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,950
an example of how you apply that in the
real world.

55
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,990
The pertinent negative in a medical
situation is when someone comes into the

56
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:40,930
emergency room and they have all the
symptoms,

57
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,780
it appears to the physician,
they have all the symptoms of pneumonia.

58
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,100
Pneumonia has three symptoms,
symptom one is present symptom to is

59
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:50,890
present,
but if symptom three is absent,

60
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,660
it's the pertinent negative.

61
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,300
You have to say symptom three is not
there,

62
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,780
therefore it's not pneumonia.
So in the real world,

63
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,910
outside of medicine,
how can we use this?

64
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,180
If we have an expectation of someone,
someone's behavior,

65
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,870
you expect them to behave a certain way
and then they don't.

66
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,310
You need to say it didn't happen.
You're evaluating someone on the job.

67
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:13,180
Well,
you did A,

68
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:17,190
B and c very well,
but you didn't do the e and f.

69
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,920
So it's looking at the affirmative and
looking at the negative and the

70
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:25,030
pertinent negative is a wonderful tool
missing missing persons cases.

71
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,670
You go to their homes,
what's not there?

72
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,640
The cell phone's not there.
The keys are not there.

73
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,850
The wallet is not there.
You're going to have a very different

74
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:38,020
search for that person if those things
were present instead of absent.

75
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,460
So this mughal painting gives us this
great opportunity to talk about not just

76
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:46,300
what we see,
but what we don't see to give the person

77
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:49,420
who can't see what we see a much more
accurate description of what they're

78
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:49,900
looking at.
