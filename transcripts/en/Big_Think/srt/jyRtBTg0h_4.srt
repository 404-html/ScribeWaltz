1
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,250
I think fashion is reached a kind of
critical mass,

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,310
literally dumb ass.
I'm

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,400
good.
Taste is no longer a privilege,

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,490
like in home design,
you can get fantastic looking things for

5
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:23,300
your home and for you to wear and you
don't have to pay a premium for that.

6
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:25,790
So I think that that's great that,
that great design,

7
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,580
great fashion.
Um,

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,000
is it all price points now?
So I think it's reached all levels of

9
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:34,940
society.
So there's a kind of egalitarian idea

10
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:37,190
that fashion is no longer for the
privileged few,

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,690
um,
which,

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,660
uh,
resonates in my democratic year with a

13
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:45,260
nice ring to it.
I think that fashion is big business.

14
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,740
Um,
let's not kid ourselves when you open up

15
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:52,460
fashion magazines and see the amount of
advertising and the amount of money

16
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:55,520
that's put in there.
Women buy clothes and continue to buy

17
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:56,440
clothes.
Um,

18
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,730
and men are getting very involved much
more.

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,390
The men's side of fashion is growing at
a large rate as well.

20
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,860
Um,
the cosmetics business,

21
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:08,960
all of that,
a part of beauty which is an extension

22
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:11,990
of fashion in a way in how you look and
how you are,

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,190
um,
health and the way we exercise,

24
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:19,940
all of that has to do with our
perceptions of who we are.

25
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:23,780
A slight cult of youthfulness and
wanting to stay young.

26
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:26,400
I think that has made fashion become an
even larger,

27
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,990
more important role.
Um,

28
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,160
because if we dress like a ladies,
we're going to feel and look like old

29
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:32,470
ladies.
So keeping on,

30
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,890
keeping fit,
looking beautiful,

31
00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:35,270
looking young,
staying young,

32
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,610
keeping current with what's going on in
the trends,

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,360
those are all part of a kind of cultural
shift and change were,

34
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,580
you know,
40 is the new 50 slash 50 is the new 60,

35
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:45,260
whatever.
Everyone's living a lot longer,

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,260
living a lot healthier and everyone's
allowed to,

37
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,700
I think tap into dressing in a way that
they never were before.

38
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,140
And the options are huge.
So you don't just have to have a chanel

39
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:57,974
suit,
you can,

40
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,960
you can do it any way you want to.
Um,

41
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,090
so I think,
I think fashion has become fun.

42
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,860
It's become acceptable,
accessible,

43
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,290
um,
and it means that good taste,

44
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,720
um,
everyone can have it.

45
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,890
I think some of them are probably a
little arrogant and snotty about it and

46
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:19,680
would love to see it on five foot 11
skinny,

47
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,960
beautiful model,
um,

48
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,800
but I can't help but think of Karl
Lagerfeld who's so smart in and his,

49
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,790
again,
reinvention of what Coco Chanel did and

50
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:33,180
liberating women from corsetry and
giving them a loose shape,

51
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:38,130
jackets and sweaters and all sorts of
things that we take for granted now that

52
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:43,050
women never wore a before she came along
to kind of liberate us from the Corset

53
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,943
of,
uh,

54
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,490
of the 19th century.
I admire Karl Lagerfeld's ability to

55
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:52,820
continually reinvent that wheel.
And I think one of his great successes

56
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:56,940
is that he accepts the modern,
if it's going to be a jersey girl with a

57
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:59,190
really expensive handbag,
fantastic.

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,650
You know,
if it's a Russian oligarchs wife who's

59
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:06,730
got gazillion rubles and she can spend
it on slightly gaudy taste,

60
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,760
why not,
um,

61
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,680
if it's the women of oil barons that can
now a dictate and pay for couture,

62
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,340
um,
a book,

63
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,790
I think if to say no to that is folly.

64
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,740
You can't change the future.
You,

65
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,830
I think his philosophy's always been and
to his great credit,

66
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,300
embrace what's new,
find out what's interesting about it.

67
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:32,950
Take from that,
learn from that.

68
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:35,200
Keep your ears open and watch what's
going on.

69
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,630
Um,
and don't be too arrogant or complacent

70
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:39,760
about it.
I think designers have to keep their

71
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,331
ear,
you know,

72
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:44,110
everyone gets tired and complacent and
thinks that what they do,

73
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,190
no,
they lose,

74
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,120
they lose touch with what's going on.
And I think he would be someone that one

75
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,430
could channel to really appreciate no
matter who's wearing it,

76
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,290
listen to their customer,
they're buying it.

77
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,124
You know,
you're,

78
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,630
you're making clothes,
you're not reinventing a,

79
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,320
the cure for life.
You're making clothing.

80
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:02,230
So whoever would work can wear it.
Does where it.

81
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,230
Gosh,
how lucky,

82
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,310
unfortunately,
that someone wants to buy what you've

83
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,480
designed or made.
