1
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,880
Bipolar disorder can have lots of effect
on a person's day to day functioning.

2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,710
Um,
so for instance,

3
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:16,680
again in the middle of an episode of
either mania or depression,

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,530
um,
people who are manic will often do

5
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:23,400
things that are really impulsive and
really out of character.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,550
And so issues of infidelity can come up.
For instance,

7
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:30,390
in a patient with media who's having a
sexual partner or sexual partners

8
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:32,580
outside of it,
the relationship in the midst of a manic

9
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:35,400
episode,
people will often spend money that they

10
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:38,400
really can't afford to spend in the
midst of a manic episode,

11
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:41,400
which you can imagine will cause a lot
of strain for them personally.

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,890
But also,
um,

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,750
in the context,
in the context of their families,

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,580
people in the midst of,
um,

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,660
mania often don't appear to be logical
and so they will go to work and we'll

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,700
have lots of irritability.

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,790
And you can imagine again that um,
coworkers are confused,

18
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:00,300
bosses are confused and especially if
they don't understand a lot about the

19
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:02,580
illness,
it can affect their work relationships

20
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,400
and their ability to maintain their
employment.

21
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,440
Um,
you can imagine that if it's hard to get

22
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:10,770
up out of bed and even go to the
supermarket and get your groceries for

23
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,900
the day,
that it can be very difficult to go to

24
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:13,734
work,
um,

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,310
and get all the things that you need to
get done either in your work life or

26
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:19,620
again,
or in your personal life.

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,340
People were port guilt or sometimes
feeling like they're worthless.

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,920
Um,
people will also report that they feel

29
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:28,560
like they're either kind of moving in
slow motion,

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,770
which is known as psychomotor
retardation and occasionally people will

31
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:35,100
report that they actually feel jittery,
which is known as psychomotor agitation.

32
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,660
Um,
in addition,

33
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:38,700
people report disturbances in their
sleep.

34
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:40,540
What's your most commonly,
um,

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,080
insomnia?
So either difficulty falling asleep,

36
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,590
waking up in the middle of the night or
waking up earlier in the morning.

37
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:50,820
Then one intends to occasionally,
this can be hypersomnia though where

38
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:52,110
people are sleeping,
for instance,

39
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:52,891
10,
12,

40
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:55,050
13,
14 or more hours per day.

41
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,750
Patients with bipolar disorder often,
um,

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,900
are resistant to receiving treatment,
especially during a manic episode.

43
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:10,370
And this is really part of the illness
in terms of not understanding that one

44
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:13,400
is sick,
bipolar disorder cannot be cured.

45
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,160
However,
people will often find that they will go

46
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,791
the,
you know,

47
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:20,810
periods of time without having any
illness or periods of euthymia.

48
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,250
It really depends on the individual and
how their clinical course goes,

49
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:29,090
as well as finding treatments that work
the mainstay of treatments or mood

50
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:30,740
stabilizers.
So these are moods,

51
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,330
medications that are used to keep
somebody from having most notably,

52
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:35,900
uh,
you know,

53
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,890
a manic episode or a depressive episode.
Finding the right treatment can

54
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:41,990
sometimes be a little frustrating.
Um,

55
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,110
and patients really need to hang in
there as their doctors tried different

56
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:49,760
medications to figure out what works
best with their neurobiology in order to

57
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,600
support a loved one who has bipolar
disorder,

58
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,930
it's really important to realize that
this is an like any other illness.

59
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,880
A lot of times people will think of
mental illnesses as being something

60
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:06,730
that's within the control of the
individual.

61
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,310
And the individual will often think that
as well,

62
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:12,550
feeling tremendous guilt when they do
have episodes of either mania or

63
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:15,010
depression.
And so the first thing is realizing

64
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:16,100
that,
um,

65
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,840
people don't choose to have bipolar
disorder and they would definitely

66
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:20,780
choose that,
um,

67
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,790
live with more mental wellness than
having this illness.

68
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,790
Um,
it's really important to be calm,

69
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,920
present and consistent with people with
bipolar disorder as well as supporting

70
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,380
them and maintaining their treatment in
the next 10,

71
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,220
20,
30,

72
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,550
50 years.
I really see a lot more research being

73
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:43,240
done to try to find treatments that are
effective and have less side effects

74
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:46,120
than some of the medications that we
have currently available today.

75
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,580
I really only see better things for the
future.
