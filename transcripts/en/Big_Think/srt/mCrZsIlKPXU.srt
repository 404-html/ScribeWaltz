1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,330
Sebastian copeland,
I a photographer,

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,360
a lecturer and an environmental
advocate,

3
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,430
jokingly referring to the age old
conflict between England and France.

4
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:27,424
And,
uh,

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,290
and my parents decided to challenge that
tradition and we're not very successful

6
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,580
at it.
So,

7
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:34,570
um,
I was,

8
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:37,150
my mother's British and my father's
French,

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,220
uh,
uh,

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,980
they separated and fairly early,
but luckily they've remained friends.

11
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,900
It was dysfunctional at first.
It's,

12
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:48,200
uh,
it's challenging at times for a child,

13
00:00:48,201 --> 00:00:50,900
I think to be a bicultural,
uh,

14
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,090
but it pays off in spades later on in
life.

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,770
And so it has given me some tools to
deal with a,

16
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:59,480
with a variety and discrepancies between
cultures and,

17
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,340
and,
um,

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,710
and as it is now,
I consider myself to be,

19
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:06,510
try cultural because I've lived in
America for a,

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,100
an excessive 25 years with nothing.
Yeah.

21
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:13,250
25 years or so.
So it just,

22
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:15,230
it's great to be able to,
first of all,

23
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:17,450
I'm bilingual and helps and then,
uh,

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,590
then try cultural in the sense that I
can navigate between these different

25
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:24,890
countries and feel I'm either not
completely at home,

26
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:26,780
but certainly not completely a foreign
island.

27
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,030
My father is a,
a,

28
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:31,700
is a classical conductor.
And,

29
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:36,050
um,
there is a long family lineage in that,

30
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:38,600
a discipline.
My great uncle was a,

31
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:41,570
uh,
was a very famous pianist who was

32
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:45,800
Toscanini's favorite pianist.
And so I was brought up in,

33
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:48,860
in an environment of classical music
and,

34
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:51,290
uh,
which translated later on in jazz.

35
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,390
And then of course,
through my rebellious stage,

36
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:55,490
I translated,
uh,

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,140
not surprisingly,
I suppose,

38
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:58,640
in a,
in punk rock.

39
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,110
So I had a sort of a fairly broad,
a range of,

40
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,230
uh,
musical exposure and a,

41
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,980
until this day,
I consider music to come any into two

42
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:11,170
jars.
And that is

43
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:16,570
[inaudible].
