1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,830
This same sky trend.
Technologies for linear synchronis

2
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:18,310
motors and the maglev,
uh,

3
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:22,120
are being applied to a wind
technologies.

4
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,100
What we're doing with our partner,
one cycle control and power conversion.

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,550
There's a couple aspects of this.
We are number one,

6
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,790
we're building a unit here in Irvine to
go up in palm springs to replace a 1980s

7
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,160
Norwegian,
a 58 foot diameter,

8
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,990
windmill,
65 kilowatts.

9
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,760
This should be going up in a couple of
weeks and we'll have to test it for a

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,640
couple months and then there's going to
be several hundred if they liked the

11
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:53,740
data they see.
In other words,

12
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,590
we do all this math and physics,
but now you've got to build stuff and

13
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:58,060
prove it.
So that's what we're doing.

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,900
So this technology,
we will eliminate the gearboxes where

15
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:08,500
you have a direct drive system.
40% of the lifetime costs of windmills

16
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,790
is the gearboxes they wear out.
The same reason on skytrain,

17
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,550
you don't want gearboxes and tires,
things wear out.

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,610
The other aspect is the power
conversion.

19
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,500
We can take low,
low speeds and high high speeds and

20
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:26,860
supply to the utility.
Southern California Edison.

21
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:30,880
In this instance,
proper frequency electric and was,

22
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,450
if all your s frequency is 60 cycle,
maybe they can accept between 50 and 70

23
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,760
while if they're great,
greatest mean,

24
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:42,760
pulled down to say 59.3 cycles a second,
guess what?

25
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:47,761
We're going to deliver 59.3 and this is
the one cycle control power technology.

26
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,690
What this enables is we can gather
energy at very low speeds and higher

27
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:57,130
speeds up to the limitations where you
have a good structural safety factor on

28
00:01:57,131 --> 00:02:02,131
the props.
We sidebuy sea side the geared type

29
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,660
system compared to our system.
In a year,

30
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:07,660
we should be able to sell about double
the energy to southern California

31
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,750
Anderson on the same wind profile on the
same hill.

32
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,200
This is going to be pretty hot.
We're getting a lot of interest in

33
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:19,201
financial interest in this technology
and it really actually gets better when

34
00:02:19,211 --> 00:02:24,211
we started talking three or five
megawatt wind mills,

35
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,220
the big ones,
and there's even 10 megawatt wind mills

36
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:27,940
up,
uh,

37
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,020
being designed not to.

38
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah.
