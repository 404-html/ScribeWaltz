1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,690
So I got pulled into economics in 2007
because of the 2008 economic crisis.

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,920
Mike Brown,
who had been the first cfo of Microsoft,

3
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:13,650
chief financial officer of Microsoft and
treasure of Microsoft.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,740
He came to Toronto in 2007.
It took my wife and I out to dinner and

5
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:25,071
said he's trying to put together a
research group to work on economics and

6
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:26,600
he would like me to be involved.
And I said,

7
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:28,620
I don't know anything about economics.
He said,

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,820
that's okay because nobody does and the
whole system is about to collapse.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,500
He said the the balance sheets of all
the big investment banks,

10
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:39,630
it's like they have cancer.
They're full of holes.

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,650
And I remember being very struck by this
because this is before anybody was

12
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:48,600
talking about this and so I started to
meet with a group of people that he was

13
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:53,601
pulling together to understand what was
going to happen and to understand if

14
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:56,490
there was any way to save the situation.

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,860
It was a very ambitious thing and of
course we failed.

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,830
But along the way,
I was motivated as a kind of public

17
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:06,831
service to get interested in economics
and what I found economics in a way it's

18
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:13,230
very easy for a physicist to understand
because it's very mathematical and the

19
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:15,960
mathematical models that they use a very
clean.

20
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:18,150
They're based on assumptions,
hypotheses,

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,840
and you can study them.
And then as I started it,

22
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,310
I began to understand some for myself
and more from just reading around

23
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:30,060
because the false with the standard
economic models with the standard models

24
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:33,030
of finance are well known.
There had been in the literature for

25
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:35,550
decades and decades.
So let me give some examples.

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,180
The Standard Model of economics is
called the neoclassical model and

27
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,020
assumes that markets are systems where
it's trading happens between consumers

28
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:49,350
and firms.
And there's certain simple models of how

29
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:53,880
that goes on and the ideas that these
come to equilibrium equilibrium.

30
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,810
Not In the physical sense,
but especially economic sense in which

31
00:01:57,811 --> 00:02:01,620
you reach a point at which the prices
are fixed,

32
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,980
such that market forces fix the prices
such that you maximize the happiness of

33
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:09,900
the consumers and maximize the profits
of the firms.

34
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,640
And in so-called equilibrium,
nobody can become happier or more

35
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:21,860
profitable without somebody else
becoming less happier,

36
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,470
less profitable,
and the ideology behind this,

37
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,890
not behind the mathematics,
because mathematics doesn't have an

38
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:31,410
ideology,
but behind the arguments that were made

39
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:36,360
and still are made from this model is
that mark has don't need regulation

40
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,100
because they have these natural
equilibrium where everybody benefits to

41
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:44,880
the maximum possible.
And if you're in equilibrium,

42
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:48,870
you can't do better.
Now there's a fault with this,

43
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:52,710
and it's an obvious follow has been
known since the 19 seventies from some

44
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:55,320
theorems approved by some economists
including,

45
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,770
um,
some of the founders of this field of

46
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,670
mathematical economics,
which is,

47
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:02,080
that does not one equilibrium.

48
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,980
There are many equilibria in fact,
is a vast number of equilibria.

49
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,390
And so which equilibria even assuming
that this is a decent model of the

50
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,650
economy,
the economy,

51
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:17,050
which is not clear,
but even assuming it's a good mile,

52
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,350
which equilibrium you're in depends on
the past history,

53
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,340
depends on regulation,
depends on politics,

54
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:26,920
depends on taste,
depends on changing tastes,

55
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:31,870
changing preferences.
And so history matters.

56
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:34,180
And what's called path dependence
matters.

57
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,600
This takes us outside of the
neoclassical model of economics,

58
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:42,601
but it doesn't take us outside of
economics because some wiser economist,

59
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:44,950
for example,
Brian Arthur had for years been

60
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:49,951
developing models and theories of path
dependent economy with a history does

61
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,390
matter.
People from the area of complex systems

62
00:03:55,391 --> 00:04:00,250
like Stu Koufman and provocative and
developing models of markets where the

63
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:03,160
history matters,
where there's not a single equilibrium

64
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:07,240
where there many equilibria and we're
change is paramount,

65
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:13,710
and another symptom of this is is the
idea that arbitrage isn't.

66
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,190
I mean in these neoclassical models,
when you go to equilibrium,

67
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:23,140
arbitrage is impossible.
Arbitrize and making a profit from

68
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:27,820
trading around a circle goods or a
circle of currencies without actually

69
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:31,900
producing anything and in equilibrium
that's supposed to be impossible,

70
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,370
but lots of firms and investment banks
and made fortunes off of currency

71
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:37,780
trading.
So why is that?

72
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,410
Turns out because you never really at
equilibrium.

73
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,160
So why is the notion of equilibrium so
powerful?

74
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,550
I think part of the answer is this idea
of physics envy that economists thought

75
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,810
that what they were doing was more
scientific,

76
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:56,980
has more corrected.
It looked like physics and physics had

77
00:04:56,981 --> 00:05:01,981
this timeless picture in which we're
really mattered as we were saying

78
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:04,630
before,
is the whole history of the system and

79
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:07,360
in physics there's also a big notion of
coming to equilibrium,

80
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:10,360
which is though however it's important
to say as a different notion of

81
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:15,361
equilibrium and somehow people in
economics got seduced into this model,

82
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,560
which again works in the small.

83
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,990
If you have a small little corner of the
economy,

84
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:23,530
a small market,
it may work for awhile to characterize

85
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:28,531
approximately what's going on.
Arbitrage is not always there.

86
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:32,050
It's not always.
I mean I recharge.

87
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:36,400
Opportunities do get eaten up the market
forces which do push you towards

88
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,500
equilibria.
There is some truth in it,

89
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,990
but the whole thing is a disaster.
If I can say that as an outsider and it

90
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:48,340
led indirectly.
It wasn't the only reason why

91
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,370
regulations were lifted on markets and
trading through the decades,

92
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,030
but when people were making arguments to
Congress,

93
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:03,170
to the president's office there that
would be that the economy would be

94
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:07,790
better off without regulation.
This was the quote,

95
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:12,791
scientific rationale for it and led to
the very unstable situation of the last

96
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:19,301
economic crisis and still a very
dangerous and unstable situation in the

97
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,530
world economy because,
well,

98
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:27,920
I'm not an economist.
I'm not going to pontificate about the

99
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,710
problems in the economy,
but one could see

100
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:37,450
how the idea of timelessness gave false
comfort to an unsuccessful scientific

101
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:42,470
theory in the realm of economists of
economics.
