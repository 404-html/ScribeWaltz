1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,080
What's so much of what happens in
schools,

2
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:16,520
it's about somehow not trying to
transgress on the interest of adults.

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,710
So,
uh,

4
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:21,710
from a symbolic perspective,
uh,

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,950
in order to ensure that everybody knew
that,

6
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:28,130
that everybody has skin in the game,
uh,

7
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,440
because,
uh,

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,680
many of the,
many of the schools that we chose to

9
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:37,620
close had been really toxic environments
in terms of,

10
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:41,810
of their outcomes for kids over time.
Uh,

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,060
because,
uh,

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,240
it seemed to us that if we were going to
create settings that we're going to work

13
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:51,020
for kids,
uh,

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,290
in a transformational way over time.
We needed to,

15
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,980
we needed to give people a chance in a,
in,

16
00:00:56,981 --> 00:01:01,730
in terms of starting new new communities
and settings that,

17
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,930
that,
uh,

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,200
had truly different cultures.
Uh,

19
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,570
we chose to close schools.
Uh,

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,140
it's,
it's unexplored in early hard endeavor

21
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,180
because one of the things that,
uh,

22
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,373
that,
uh,

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,980
uh,
every superintendent who tries this,

24
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,600
uh,
immediately learns is that it doesn't

25
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,190
matter how bad our school is.

26
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,400
Uh,
the community doesn't want to close.

27
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,890
Uh,
you have schools where,

28
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:30,710
you know,
25% of the kids are performing a

29
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:33,890
proficient and events or were,
you know,

30
00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:36,470
30% of the kids have,
have graduated.

31
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,050
And you have people coming to tell you
that,

32
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:39,890
that now,
no,

33
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,780
it's not.
It's not about the schools,

34
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:43,760
it's about the school not getting
support.

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,860
Uh,
there's also a sense in neighborhoods,

36
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,180
schools are very much part of the
history of neighborhoods.

37
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,373
And,
uh,

38
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,980
anybody who there's two closest school
in some way is,

39
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:00,020
is,
is violating,

40
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,990
uh,
uh,

41
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,180
uh,
a story arc for that neighborhood.

42
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,800
Uh,
people,

43
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,230
uh,
graduated from that school.

44
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,700
Uh,
uh,

45
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,540
quite often you have teachers who,
who attended the school.

46
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,670
Uh,
and there's always this,

47
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:21,140
this the sense that that the central
office has not done its job.

48
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,230
Uh,
which for us was,

49
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,820
was,
uh,

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,120
you know,
something that we,

51
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:29,930
we,
we admitted from the stars and this is

52
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:32,600
not about the schools per se.

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,980
This is about how a system has accepted
failure of a time.

54
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:39,380
And if we're,
if we're going to succeed,

55
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:43,400
then we need to understand that a,
that there has to be a process of

56
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:44,840
renewal.
And a,

57
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,900
and we need to give a new schools a
chance.

58
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,980
Uh,
so it wasn't hard for us,

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,680
uh,
in terms of making the decision.

60
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:57,050
It was hard to implement it.
Uh,

61
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:01,150
we closed a six last year.
Uh,

62
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,680
we're closing another five this year.
We just announced it on Tuesday.

63
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,060
Uh,
we'd already launched in that process

64
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:10,894
of,
of,

65
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,430
of having conversations with community
that,

66
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:15,330
that,
uh,

67
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,690
takes tremendous energy from staff.
Uh,

68
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,553
and,
uh,

69
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,371
you know,
we,

70
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:22,960
we,
it does by the way,

71
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:27,250
that there's this debate about whether
the way to improve school systems is to

72
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:29,830
close schools to turn him around.
I mean,

73
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:31,930
I think it takes everything.
Uh,

74
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,000
we closed some,
we turned some around in terms of,

75
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:37,240
of,
of bringing in new programs.

76
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,770
Uh,
but,

77
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:40,870
but the closure,
uh,

78
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:44,220
of the worst performing schools,
I think it's,

79
00:03:44,221 --> 00:03:47,380
it's absolutely necessary,
uh,

80
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,460
as long as we're providing something
that is better,

81
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,280
uh,
as part of the exchange.

82
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:55,540
So,
uh,

83
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,790
it's been a hard thing for us to do,
but something that I think is making the

84
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,690
district,
uh,

85
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,450
much better.
We've become predictable,

86
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:07,600
which is,
which is a really good thing in terms of

87
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,730
how,
how organizations work.

88
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,750
Uh,
uh,

89
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,060
you know,
principals understand that if,

90
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,150
if,
if the outcomes go down,

91
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,210
uh,
there are certain consequences and the

92
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:21,490
consequences are not simply about the
kids.

93
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,010
Uh,
it's about what happens to,

94
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,580
to an institution right now.
For example,

95
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm recommending the non renewal of a
charter.

96
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,520
Uh,
it will be the first time thought I

97
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:36,250
chatted is none renewed in,
uh,

98
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,010
in the district.
And the reason for that is that,

99
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,590
you know,
here's a school that has all the

100
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:44,440
autonomy in the world.
The district is advancing,

101
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,210
the school is regressing.
Well,

102
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,740
you know,
uh,

103
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,680
the school loses the charter,
uh,

104
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,290
in the same way that a traditional
school might be close.
