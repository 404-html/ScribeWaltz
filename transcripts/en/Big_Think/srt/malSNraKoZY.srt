1
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,370
I think it comes down to equality,
um,

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,490
which is I think such a silly thing to
say in 2008,

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,740
um,
but I think it comes down to sort of

4
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:20,770
civil rights,
the right to get married,

5
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:25,390
the right to file your taxes together,
hospital visitation rights,

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,710
um,
and,

7
00:00:26,711 --> 00:00:30,430
and I think beyond that is equality
including in the military with don't

8
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:31,270
ask,
don't tell,

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,090
which seems to always be a hot button
issue that pops up,

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,680
uh,
you know,

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,100
once a year or so,
but especially now with the presidential

12
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:40,170
debate,
uh,

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,890
and uh,
candidates taking a aside on the issue.

14
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,691
Um,
but I,

15
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:48,610
I think it comes down to basic civil
rights

16
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:59,230
because I think it remains even among
people who claim to support gay rights.

17
00:00:59,781 --> 00:01:04,490
I think it remains a taboo subject in
that while if we're saying the majority

18
00:01:04,491 --> 00:01:06,710
of America has no problem with gay
people,

19
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,030
I think that there's an asterisk that
position no problem with gay people so

20
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:13,400
long as you're not my son as long as
you're not my sister.

21
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,860
Um,
and I,

22
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:17,930
and I think the idea of introducing that
and into one's personal life,

23
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,660
um,
whether people will own up to it or not

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,390
remains an issue.
I think it's very easy from the bubble

25
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:25,910
of New York or la just say,
you know,

26
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:28,280
this should be a nonissue,
but there so much,

27
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,310
so many opinions and views in between
those coasts that don't necessarily

28
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:38,180
agree with that.
And I think it's very clear that I'm a

29
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,220
evangelical and a very conservative
religious groups,

30
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,000
uh,
maintain quite a bit of power in this

31
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:49,130
country because there are,
you know,

32
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:53,690
it's very clear that candidates are,
are leaning one way or the other one

33
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,810
when it comes to their approach of them.
And there are viewpoints,

34
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,270
uh,
have to be taken seriously on the

35
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:00,910
political spectrum.
Uh,

36
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,180
and that's,
you know,

37
00:02:02,181 --> 00:02:05,510
it's there that these things are going
to change.

38
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,170
I have,
I have a,

39
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,930
I have a personal issue with,
with the idea that some people can

40
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,510
tolerate homosexuality.
Um,

41
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,100
I do not tolerate women.
I do not tolerate black or Asian people.

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,560
Uh,
I embraced them as they would anyone

43
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:30,440
else.
And so I think right now we're sending

44
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:35,441
this message of a tolerance and I think
it is a stepping stone toward embracing

45
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:38,820
or even so much so that it's a nonissue.
Um,

46
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,300
I,
I think right now the goal needs to be,

47
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,890
um,
to,

48
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,980
to promote this as a normalized a sort
of behavior.

49
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:53,210
And I think that if we're taking these
sort of bandaid or sideways approaches

50
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,180
to get to a final result,
we're going to end up with something

51
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:59,550
that's still not viewed very well.
So the,

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,230
I think the message we need to be
pitching is,

53
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,440
um,
this sort of normalized behavior.

54
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,530
Gay people are just like straight
people.

55
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,540
They just leap with the same sex.
I mean,

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,640
that's really all it comes down to.
I think it's easier for me to say that's

57
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:17,890
such a simple message,
not only because I live in a very urban

58
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:19,210
area,
but I'm a gay man.

59
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,050
Uh,
you know,

60
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,050
on the same token,
I don't think it's very easy for,

61
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,071
um,
you know,

62
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:26,380
other folks in more conservative parts
of the country,

63
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,660
uh,
to accept that message.

64
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,990
You know,
I'm a little bit torn there because I

65
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:40,730
think Hollywood shouldn't necessarily be
a platform for any message,

66
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,390
but then I also believe it's foolish to
imagine that it doesn't,

67
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,740
um,
you know,

68
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,080
from,
from the very basic of cutting out

69
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:52,100
smoking for movies and what that did to
views toward people who smoke.

70
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,181
Um,
you know,

71
00:03:53,181 --> 00:03:58,181
I think we're moving beyond,
I like to think the token gay character

72
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,880
in movies and TV shows,
um,

73
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,630
but I don't think we're quite there yet,
but I think that's important to show

74
00:04:05,631 --> 00:04:06,570
that,
uh,

75
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,620
even in mainstream movies to have gay
and lesbian characters who are

76
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:15,290
normalized,
they're not the token gay character.

77
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,180
They are another character in that
movie.

78
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,081
Um,
and I,

79
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:23,081
and I liked the idea of sort of a plot
lines within a TV and film that deal

80
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:29,060
with gay men and women,
but don't necessarily focus on that as a

81
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:32,600
sole issue because then I,
I think it sort of creates a caricature

82
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,990
of what this is supposed to be.
So I,

83
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:39,200
I do think to an extent,
Hollywood does hold some responsibility,

84
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,370
but,
uh,

85
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:42,590
you know,
homophobia exists in that industry like

86
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:43,760
any other,
um,

87
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:46,490
while you know your agent or your
publicist can be gay,

88
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,020
uh,
don't expect to sign on to a movie as an

89
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,470
open gay person a and an expected big
paycheck.

90
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,250
It's very easy for me to,
as a movie goer to say Hollywood.

91
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:05,980
The institution needs to change their
ways.

92
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,450
But I also think if they've put a,
a openly gay character in a,

93
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,790
in a major motion picture,
uh,

94
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,790
I don't think it would perform as well
as the bar at the box office.

95
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:20,050
So I think we do need to take small
steps to reach that end all goal.

96
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:22,810
It's not going to happen overnight.
And I think it'd be foolish to assume

97
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:23,740
so.
But,

98
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,150
um,
you know,

99
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:30,151
I think the American public does still
have this cringe mentality when it comes

100
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:36,781
to the idea of gay men and women playing
leading roles or roles where they aren't

101
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,270
the gay character,
uh,

102
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:45,570
all the way to Hollywood that is fearful
of even opening up that possibility

103
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,570
because the investment is so large.
And,

104
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:51,640
uh,
in a studio wants to make that bet.
