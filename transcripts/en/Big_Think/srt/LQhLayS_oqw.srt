1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,821
Trolling,
uh,

2
00:00:00,821 --> 00:00:05,821
certainly the topic of the year,
if we were having this conversation in

3
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:09,870
1995 for one thing,
the screen would be about one 16th.

4
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:13,380
The size and the video quality would be
much poorer,

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,680
but it would be a very standard
configuration.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,660
The story would be,
hey,

7
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:21,210
there's now an internet.
People can say anything.

8
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:24,000
Sometimes it gets a little out of
control and maybe the government will

9
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:29,001
come in and try to regulate in some way,
but it's basically the government is

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,200
trying to stop illegal or really extreme
things from happening and otherwise it's

11
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,760
just a free for all out there.
I'm away.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,170
We go fast forward 10,
15,

13
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:45,171
20 years and we see an environment now
in which many many people want to

14
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:49,050
participate,
maybe have used.

15
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:53,820
They want to share and if you stick your
head up out of the gopher hole and it

16
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:58,170
happened to say something in temperate
or wrong or that others may disapprove

17
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:59,940
of,
they might not just say,

18
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:01,230
Gee,
I disagree.

19
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,610
Let's,
let's talk about this.

20
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:05,520
Or something.
They may decide to try to docs.

21
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:10,050
You find out where you live,
the names of the rest of your family to

22
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:13,110
threaten you with the goal of making you
feel insecure.

23
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:16,500
They might try to swat you,
tell the police that there's something

24
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:18,540
terrible going on in your house and
before you know it,

25
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:22,320
there's blue and red lights outside your
window and people ready to kick in the

26
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:26,340
door.
This is a strange state of affairs and

27
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:31,170
it's one I think with multiple causes
and that actually is susceptible to

28
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:35,070
pretty sustained study,
most of which hasn't happened yet in the

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,903
next few years.
I think it will.

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,350
That says what makes people want to
react that way.

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,450
My best cut on it at the most abstract
level is that when we are online,

32
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,550
we may be undertaking very different
activities and the people that we're

33
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:51,384
talking to.

34
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,870
One model for being online is I'm
entertaining myself.

35
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:57,440
I'm having fun.
I am in some form or another plane

36
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,760
again,
and if that's the case,

37
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,410
playing the game means picking aside and
that's a very different model from.

38
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,510
I'm online because I really believe
earnestly and something and I want to

39
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,630
convince you of why I'm right or have
you maybe convince me or find people who

40
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:19,470
are of like mind and we can talk about
strategizing about the thing that we

41
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:22,650
really care about.
Those are totally different activities

42
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:26,610
and when you try to mix the two,
it's almost like saying if there's going

43
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:31,611
to be a discussion between Seattle
seahawks fans and New England patriots

44
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:35,520
fans ahead of a superbowl,
can't we just settle this with a

45
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:39,870
discussion like can't we just earnestly
era our differences and come to some

46
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:43,230
compromise that the patriots should win,
but only by five points.

47
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,640
Like that's nuts.
The purpose of the conversation is sort

48
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:52,641
of just the chest thumping that comes
from the play of being a fan of a team

49
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:55,280
and trash talking to the other team and
then,

50
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,310
you know,
you play the game.

51
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,150
I think that for a lot of trolling
there's a sense that it's just not

52
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,390
impersonal.
We're just out to have some fun.

53
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,010
Others have referred to this as four
Chan culture and uh,

54
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,990
of course named after the site four Chan
for which this is the largely the

55
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:18,160
culture figuring out I think,
how to have people avoid category errors

56
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,900
might be a good way to relieve a little
bit the initial conditions that give

57
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:31,840
rise to a situation that you fast
forward and somehow death or rape

58
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,930
threats are being made.
Personal information is getting

59
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:39,931
scattered everywhere and the parties
behind it still or just like think it's

60
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:40,690
no big deal.

61
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,560
Like they just go to sleep at night and
tomorrow they'll find a new cause to get

62
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:48,520
involved in.
I imagine we will also see some of these

63
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:52,630
intermediary platforms that are commonly
used for many purposes like twitter.

64
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,590
They're going to start taking a heavier
hand at intervening when discussions get

65
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:02,560
rough and it might be as simple as,
uh,

66
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,240
being more willing to delete accounts,
which let's be clear that's going to

67
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,700
mean that others will be more willing to
try to import tune twitter to delete

68
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:12,010
accounts as part of the battle,
uh,

69
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,090
between people who are arguing about
something over the longer term.

70
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:20,090
I think we may see coming into view
something has been promised for awhile

71
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,120
and uh,
be careful what you ask for.

72
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:25,780
I think we're going to get it,
which is to say some form of singular or

73
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:30,280
multi-platform reputation systems.
Think how different ones,

74
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:32,590
twitter or facebook experience might be.

75
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,010
If the feed is populated on the basis of
people who are known to participate with

76
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,870
a bare minimum of civility.
Let's define it easily as don't engage

77
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:47,710
in serious imminent death threats and if
you do,

78
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,630
you might not have your account deleted,
but you will find that the way in which

79
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:57,631
you tweet will not have the same reach
as people who either through the twitter

80
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:02,821
platform or through behavior on other
platforms that has been deemed a civil

81
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:08,311
and productive.
Those will start to get reach to and I.

82
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,590
I will say that once people kind of know
the basis on which they're being graded

83
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,990
can have a really instant effect on
their behavior.

84
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,770
Some of us may remember the moment that
uber mistakenly made it easy for

85
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:28,471
somebody to find his or her own rating
as a passenger by drivers on Uber,

86
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,170
drivers rate passengers,
not just the other way around,

87
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,370
and people are much more self conscious
now maybe about how they'll behave in an

88
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,270
uber if they want to retain a good
rating so that they will be more likely

89
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:44,350
to be picked up when they need a cab or
a ride in the future.

90
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:50,010
Those reputation systems both hold
promise as a way of having trolling the,

91
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,940
if not punished,
not rewarded,

92
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:57,770
good behavior,
whatever that means is the eyes of the

93
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:01,760
people rating.
I'm a rising you up in the scales and

94
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:06,710
giving you more reach a and of course
also carries with it a whole host of new

95
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:08,840
and difficult questions about,
well,

96
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:12,090
who runs this rating system?
And one of the people writing me or

97
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:17,091
raping me by criteria that are unfair,
that might be based on the color of my

98
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:22,781
skin or my ethnicity or something like
that that we could find rating systems

99
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:27,230
doing.
Now we're just not exactly there yet.

100
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,450
Uh,
so we have to see what are the solutions

101
00:06:30,451 --> 00:06:33,410
that will come about problems like
trolling and one of the problems that

102
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:34,640
those solutions will raise.
