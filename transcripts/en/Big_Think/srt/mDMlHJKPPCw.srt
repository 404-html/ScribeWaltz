1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,470
Machine intelligence includes two main
areas.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,330
One is high performance computing,
all the chips you need to do the complex

3
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:19,130
math required and then artificial
intelligence within artificial

4
00:00:19,131 --> 00:00:21,740
intelligence,
all the breakthroughs are happening in

5
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:26,540
the area of machine learning and machine
learning includes the ability for

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,830
computers to think,
learn and act on their own.

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,290
There are a lot of great examples
throughout business government and the

8
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:39,650
nonprofit world as well.
For example,

9
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,360
in the u s government,
machine learning is completely changing

10
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:49,361
how census workers visit houses to
collect the census data.

11
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:55,570
These numerators in the past would just
use their own judgment on what routes to

12
00:00:55,941 --> 00:01:00,941
take and when to visit houses and of
course they often found people not home

13
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,080
and the upcoming 2020 descending hill
census machine learning will actually

14
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:11,081
give them the best routes and the best
predicted times to find when people are

15
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:12,200
going to be home.

16
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,160
When people ask me if machine
intelligence will affect them,

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,520
I turn the question back around and say,
could you imagine your life or your job

18
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:25,820
without the Internet?
And most people will say no.

19
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,590
And I say that's how machine
intelligence will become for us.

20
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,840
It's already,
uh,

21
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,070
involved in our personal lives,
whether it's Amazon recommendation

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:42,100
engines or Netflix recommendation,
but it will continue to spread not only

23
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:48,731
in our personal and entertainment lives,
but also in our day to day work lives as

24
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:53,960
well.
One example is it departments in

25
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:58,070
corporations,
many companies spend the majority of

26
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:01,430
their it budget on it,
operations,

27
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,150
operations and maintenance.
And it's a huge budget line item.

28
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,750
Machine intelligence is now able to
perform most or all of those mundane

29
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:16,991
routine activities that frees up an
entire skilled workforce to focus on

30
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,450
creativity and innovation beyond the
jobs that they're doing today.

31
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:29,060
So machine intelligence is not about
completely removing the person from the

32
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:30,140
equation equation.

33
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,830
It's about machines and humans working
together.

34
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,690
We never recommend that you completely
abandon your judgment as a leader.

35
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,020
Many times machine learning is wrong.
And as leaders we need to recognize that

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,010
and know when to ask questions and how
to adapt.

37
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,730
So judgment is still absolutely critical
in this equation.

38
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,690
An interesting example is automated
trucking company,

39
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,670
Otto.
It was formed by Google engineers and

40
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:05,050
within 10 months bought by Uber for $680
million.

41
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,680
Now,
what would make a company worth $680

42
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,300
million in 10 months?
Well,

43
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,360
auto developed a cab top device sells
for $30,000 and can fully automate any

44
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:24,270
18 wheeler truck built after 2013
in fact,

45
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,800
they've already made their first
delivery using a self driving truck.

46
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,140
It was 50,000 cans of Budweiser beer
last year.

47
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,580
Right now the truck can't handle every
situation.

48
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,140
It's really great on the highways,
but it has problems in bad weather and

49
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,220
on city streets.

50
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,060
So for now the drivers continue to ride
in the cab,

51
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,320
but when they're on the highway,
the drivers free to conduct whatever

52
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:56,080
activities they choose.
And I love the story of a driver doing

53
00:03:56,081 --> 00:04:00,440
yoga while going down the highway.
And then the driver takes over in

54
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:05,080
difficult situations,
there is no question that artificial

55
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:08,590
intelligence will replace certain types
of tasks.

56
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,400
There are tasks today that machines are
better at than people.

57
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,450
Tasks like organizing,
remembering,

58
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,740
finding patterns.
So those kinds of tasks will be replaced

59
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:25,120
by machines.
But people are still so much better at

60
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,290
creativity and framing problems and
reasoning.

61
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:34,630
So what will happen is that machines
will replace the row,

62
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,300
some of the rote tasks that people are
doing today.

63
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,440
And it's up to us then to figure out as
leaders,

64
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,590
what do we do with that talent and how
do we take advantage of the opportunity

65
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:48,700
that that gives us.

66
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,880
So it's not a matter of machines putting
people out of work across the board.

67
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:00,150
What goes hand in hand with that are the
new businesses that it will create the

68
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:05,731
new industries that it might spawn and a
whole new set of demands that aren't,

69
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:11,040
that don't exist today that um,
people will be,

70
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,070
be able to go into for a second or third
career.

71
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,820
One example of this is the data science
bowl.

72
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,330
Every year we put on the data science
bowl with Kaggle and we choose a really

73
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:31,831
hard social good problem.
Kaggle puts it out to its community of a

74
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,200
million data scientists around the world
and they saw they work as volunteers to

75
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:42,541
solve the problem.
Last year the challenge was around heart

76
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:47,551
health and this year it was around new
ways of predicting lung cancer and of

77
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:54,340
the top 10 winning teams,
many of them had no background in the

78
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:55,750
medical field whatsoever.

79
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,540
Prior to this competition,
they were able to learn with the medical

80
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:03,980
knowledge they needed through tutorials
and because they came at it from

81
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:07,070
different angles and different
perspectives,

82
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,940
they were able to make breakthroughs in
the lung cancer challenge.

83
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,210
The top 10 algorithms will improve by
10% the accuracy of predicting lung

84
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:19,160
cancer.
In fact,

85
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,430
one of the winning teams has already
secured venture capital funding to turn

86
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:30,911
that algorithm into a new business.
So that's an example of a business that

87
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,220
didn't exist previously and is launched
because of machine intelligence.

88
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,390
As a society,
we need to make sure we help folks whose

89
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:46,391
jobs will be taken over by ai because
there will certainly be tasks that are

90
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:50,360
no longer that no longer require a
person to do them.

91
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,990
They answer to that dilemma is to
retrain those folks into different

92
00:06:56,271 --> 00:07:01,271
skillsets that can be applied to the new
industries and the new companies and the

93
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:03,410
new jobs that are created.

94
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,680
So the best policy position that we can
take as a nation is to invest in

95
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:14,171
retraining those workers.
It doesn't help to deny the problem or

96
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,280
to think that it's way out when it's
already happening today.

97
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,490
We need to be proactive about retraining
that workforce so that we don't have a

98
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:27,590
class of people left behind.
And by the way,

99
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,160
this doesn't apply only to blue collar
type jobs.

100
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,830
For example,
doctors,

101
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,400
their jobs will be completely disrupted
and change,

102
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,550
will no longer rely on a doctor's
knowledge or experience to diagnose and

103
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:46,490
treat diseases.
Instead of doctors would become

104
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:50,840
interpreters of models.
The legal profession will be disrupted

105
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,130
no longer.
While we require people to do research

106
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,880
on precedents and caselaw machines will
be able to do that.

107
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:03,650
So it affects every walk of life and
every industry,

108
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,970
but we need to invest in the people who
are displaced so that we take full

109
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:12,050
advantage of that talent to use toward
greater ends.

110
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,500
One thing I'd say about barriers is that
anyone can learn machine intelligence.

111
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:23,060
Many people feel like this is something
they had to major in in school,

112
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,560
or they have to work at a tech company
to become an expert that's no longer

113
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:30,950
true.
Many of the leaders that we interviewed

114
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:35,300
for our book have no background in
machine intelligence whatsoever before

115
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:40,130
they took on these projects,
and so anyone can and should learn about

116
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:43,310
machine intelligence.
It will be that much of a game changer.
