1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,860
That's a very important question because
you have to learn to love whatever you

2
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:11,850
do like in the failures as much as the
successes because they'll probably be a

3
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:14,970
lot more failures than successes.
And so that's a very important lesson to

4
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:17,220
learn early on.
And I learned it early in my career

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,570
because my phd really got off to a
pretty poor star and so there's a long

6
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:23,370
period of time where I had to say,
is this worth it?

7
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:25,230
And uh,
many of my friends were just sort of

8
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:26,390
saying like,
you know,

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,810
you're already accepted into medical
school,

10
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:32,000
why do you even need this?
And I think I was just really like the,

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,270
the puzzle that I was sort of trying to
figure out what is a compelling enough

12
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:39,540
to me that I kept going with it.
So I think in science you have to be

13
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:44,100
very patient and you have to enjoy like
the process and it's nice to think about

14
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:45,210
where the process will take you.

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,690
But it's important to enjoy like each
aspect of the process itself.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,470
Um,
and so I think that we're lucky because

17
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:55,560
we're in a time right now that there are
so many tools available that there are

18
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:57,640
many discoveries being made,
so um,

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,550
you know,
there's just many opportunities to

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,950
advance the field and it's coming from
all directions,

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,800
so that's a lucky time,
but obviously there will be droughts

22
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:08,570
where we figured we've kind of tapped
the genome to its full potential and

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,670
looking for the next thing and the
difficulties with each aspect of

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,980
changing paradigms.
So they'll,

25
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,590
there will be periods have already
experienced some,

26
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:18,840
maybe not like the biggest I could
experience,

27
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:22,140
but it definitely experienced long
periods of failed work.

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,220
Um,
and I just,

29
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,610
I still enjoy it.
I just enjoy the day to day and that's

30
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:27,990
important to do,
like teaching.

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,760
I love teaching.
Yeah,

32
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,190
love.
That's one of the reasons why I didn't

33
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:35,400
look at.
I looked at being in an undergraduate

34
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:37,500
campus because I really enjoy teaching.
I think it's,

35
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,170
I think it's wonderful and you're very
lucky to be with such.

36
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,620
I mean all students are really exciting,
but it's really lucky to be with such

37
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,640
motivated students.
It's,

38
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:45,840
you know,
it's an easy job,

39
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:47,850
so it's,
it's really up to you.

40
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,350
Um,
you know,

41
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:52,500
if the students are engaged,
it's something you have to think about.

42
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,580
How do you engage them.
