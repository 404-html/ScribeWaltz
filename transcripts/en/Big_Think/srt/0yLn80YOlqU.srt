1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,430
Uh,
uh,

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,760
of the changes since nine 11 have been 
positive.

3
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:16,594
I mean an enormous amount of money has 
been thrown at the intelligence 

4
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:20,890
community.
So you,

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,520
you went from a period in the 90s where,
uh,

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,443
the peace dividend after the cold war 
was in many cases taken at the expense 

7
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:34,801
of the intelligence community and there 
wasn't much hiring going on and a lot of

8
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:35,944
early retirements are being forced and 
there weren't very many investments and 

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,403
place,
it really kind of hollowed out after 

10
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,640
nine 11,
massive amounts of money were thrown in.

11
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:45,630
Everybody went on huge hiring sprees and
what you,

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,793
I mean,
I don't live inside the community but 

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,350
touring it and bumping up against it.
What I,

14
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,190
my impression is that immediately after 
nine 11,

15
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:55,024
you had an extraordinarily talented 
group of young people volunteer to go 

16
00:00:58,061 --> 00:00:58,894
into the intelligence beauty,
probably the best generation of public 

17
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:01,990
servants and went into the government.

18
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,520
You know,
since the 60s,

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,370
people were motivated.
They were smart,

20
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:08,740
they were well educated and they were 
committed,

21
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,730
uh,
after nine,

22
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:11,860
11,
and then they,

23
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:12,723
but they went into the system.
The system really didn't know how to 

24
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:15,940
absorb them.
And a lot of them bounced out.

25
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,043
A lot of people became disillusioned.
There weren't a good senior programs or 

26
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,343
officers available to mentor them.
And so I think that sort of wave of 

27
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:32,290
young people as has been atrophied and 
maybe not,

28
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,190
um,
sort of,

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,580
um,
brought up to the way,

30
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:37,414
the way you would win in the meanwhile,
one of their experiences when all these 

31
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:40,624
really great people went in was that the
whole system kept being reorganized and 

32
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:46,600
then reorganized again.
And then the agencies,

33
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:47,434
we're all moving around.
And so I think the sense you have from 

34
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:51,214
inside is that there's still a lot of 
confusion about what is a career in 

35
00:01:57,731 --> 00:01:58,630
intelligence.
I mean,

36
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:03,100
how do you actually have a useful and 
successful and interesting career as a,

37
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,330
as an operative.
I mean,

38
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:05,230
analysts,
you know,

39
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:06,910
there's millions of analysts running 
around.

40
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,063
Um,
but as to the actual collection of 

41
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:11,674
intelligence,
which was what the problem seemed to be 

42
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,950
running up to nine 11,
I don't think the system is,

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,833
is,
I don't think the system is fixed at 

44
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:20,590
all.
I think it's still a mess.

45
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,810
Yes.
Sorry.

46
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:26,990
For

47
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,560
private firms,
I think that's a,

48
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,150
I think that's plain.
I think it's,

49
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:31,984
um,
I don't think that private contractors 

50
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,870
ought to be acting on the battlefield as
sort of proxies for or allies of the u s

51
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:44,050
military.
Um,

52
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,093
I think private contracting for 
logistics and for support and for 

53
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:50,020
technology,
um,

54
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,100
and maybe for some analysis,
uh,

55
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,093
can be part of a governmental system,
but to have private contractors in the 

56
00:02:58,241 --> 00:02:59,074
field tearing out the,
the sort of state craft of war or 

57
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,380
shadowy intelligence,
a warlike activity,

58
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,500
paramilitary or collection activity,
I think is a mistake.

59
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,263
Pardon?

60
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:18,571
You know,
he's a,

61
00:03:18,571 --> 00:03:19,404
he's a professional who I think was 
welcomed there when he was appointed 

62
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:27,030
because the turmoil of the previous 
regime had been pretty considerable.

63
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,343
He was a known quantity.
He was known to be sort of a friend of 

64
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:32,094
the CIA,
wasn't there to tear it down or kind of 

65
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:37,360
reinvent it the way some other directors
had,

66
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:38,194
had come in wanting to do.
But the basic problem that he faces and 

67
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:43,284
that the agency faces is that they 
basically had been reorganized out of 

68
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:47,754
their prestige and to some extent 
reorganized out of their parts of their 

69
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:53,120
mission.
And you know,

70
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,023
they've lost their place at the table.
Their place at the table with the White 

71
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,140
House is now taken by the director of 
national intelligence,

72
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:04,890
the new sort of tsar of all the 
intelligence agencies.

73
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,173
And that means the CIA is adjusting to a
completely different world in which it 

74
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:09,450
does.

75
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,640
No,
it no longer has direct contact with the

76
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:13,110
press of the United States every 
morning.

77
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,333
That's what made the CIA the source of 
all this mystique in our political 

78
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:18,180
culture was that,
you know,

79
00:04:18,181 --> 00:04:19,560
every morning,
first thing,

80
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:21,500
six 30 or 7:00
AM the president nodded,

81
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,343
states sits down with the director of 
the CIA or his designated briefer and 

82
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,304
they talk about the world.
And when the president wants something 

83
00:04:28,621 --> 00:04:30,970
done off the books,
uh,

84
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,330
he turns to the CIA and he says 
directly,

85
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,513
you know,
I want to,

86
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,740
I want to raid Cuba or I want to foment 
a descent in this country or that,

87
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,480
and that relationship of the president 
and the CIO is broken.

88
00:04:45,481 --> 00:04:46,314
It just doesn't exist anymore.
The CIA has now more like the FBI at 

89
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,363
works at one step removed.
It has a mission to go out into the 

90
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:56,100
world and steal secrets and occasionally
go out in the world and blow up bridges.

91
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,510
But it's doing that almost as a kind of 
separate like,

92
00:05:00,511 --> 00:05:01,260
uh,
like,

93
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,093
like the Federal Reserve that does 
monetary policy that they're divorced 

94
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:05,964
from,
from policy and decision making or if 

95
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,060
there's an intermediary and the DA and 
Dni.

96
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,283
And I think Hayden has not been able to 
quite resolve how this reorganization 

97
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,960
will play out in the,
in the life of the institution.

98
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,160
Well,
there's a very heated debate yeah.

99
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,950
Within the U s army and the military 
continuing now,

100
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:31,380
and I'm still,
I'm doing some work on this now.

101
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,090
Um,
and you know,

102
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,270
the,
the strain,

103
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,580
everyone agrees there was an enormous 
strain.

104
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,260
Uh,
the question is,

105
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,820
uh,
that are,

106
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,683
the questions that are debated are what 
are the strategic consequences of this 

107
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,400
strain.
Um,

108
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,893
and on the one hand you have those like 
Casey or a certain colonels and others 

109
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,450
who would emphasize the loss of combat 
capability,

110
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,273
uh,
the potential for a surprise elsewhere 

111
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:07,760
in the world that the United States 
can't respond to.

112
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,980
Um,
and,

113
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,653
and the general sort of inability of the
United States to say pivot from Iraq 

114
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,830
where things may be going better to 
Afghanistan,

115
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:22,430
where things are clearly going worse 
because there just is no,

116
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,090
there's no elasticity in the,
in the system anymore.

117
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:29,510
The resources are all on the,
in the field.

118
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,100
So that's one side.

119
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,790
The other side emphasizes as gates did 
and a speech a couple of weeks ago,

120
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,013
look,
we have armies to win the wars that 

121
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:40,250
we're in.
And you know,

122
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:43,270
I would rather break an army winning,
uh,

123
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,470
the war that we have to win than worry 
about some future scenario.

124
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,783
Nobody this.
So somebody was arguing with her the 

125
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,730
other day.
I says,

126
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,563
you know,
nobody worried during World War II that 

127
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:56,054
we were going to break the army and 
overemphasize figuring out how to beat 

128
00:06:59,091 --> 00:06:59,924
Nazi Germany.
And then we were going to miss Vietnam 

129
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:03,140
because we hadn't prepared for 
counterinsurgency.

130
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,523
No,
you,

131
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,503
that's what you have armies for is to go
all out to achieve the objectives you 

132
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:09,554
need to achieve now.
So then that depends on whether you 

133
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:14,770
believe finishing in Iraq with every,
uh,

134
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,530
brigade available is really in the 
national interest.

135
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,161
Uh,
and that,

136
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:19,994
and so in the end,
these arguments about strain and 

137
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:24,790
breaking the army,
uh,

138
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,730
there are kind of coded argument about 
whether the rock is still worthwhile.

139
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,700
I think the hud still important for a 
lot of them

140
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,760
reasons.
Uh,

141
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,660
you know,
starting with justice,

142
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:39,860
the fact that he's,
you know,

143
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:40,694
at large and,
and has more or less accepted 

144
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:45,830
responsibility for the attacks and no 
one's ever bothered to chase him down.

145
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,550
Um,
but more sort of relevant to the current

146
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:51,230
scene.
This,

147
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:55,220
we talked before about the 20 years of 
continuous leadership,

148
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,340
the ability to deliver messages to 
followers,

149
00:07:58,341 --> 00:07:59,174
to define the narrative of the war that 
he believes he's leading to identify 

150
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,430
targets to name countries,
but he's still matters.

151
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,740
It doesn't matter the way he did in 
1999,

152
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:07,574
but taking him off the airwaves and 
forcing al-Qaida to deal for the first 

153
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:13,070
time in 20 years with a succession 
crisis,

154
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,353
probably from the point of view of 
alcaide his adversaries would be a good 

155
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:18,080
objective.
Um,

156
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,720
so I think there are lots of reasons why
the,

157
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,440
the hunt for him still matters as to 
what al Qaeda is capability is,

158
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,240
uh,
this year.

159
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:31,370
Um,
I think all you can really do is look at

160
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:32,204
what the system is reporting by way of 
kind of threat reporting on the one 

161
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:36,434
hand,
and then what all the open source 

162
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:41,840
evidence from the last three or four 
years tells you about their capability.

163
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:42,674
And I think that in summary,
what it tells you is that they still 

164
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:51,071
have the intent to carry out what you 
might think of as sort of medium sized,

165
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,890
uh,
attacks against airplanes,

166
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,250
uh,
against,

167
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,060
uh,
subway systems against embassies,

168
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:04,740
military bases.
They have the capability to plan sort of

169
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:06,900
six to nine month,
fairly complicated,

170
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:07,734
fairly ambitious plans like the one 
that's on trial in London involving the 

171
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:13,770
attempt to blow up planes over the 
Atlantic in August of 2006,

172
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:16,740
the one that led to us not being able to
carry our toothpaste board airplanes,

173
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,560
that was their most ambitious plots 
since nine 11.

174
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,900
It was meant to be the fifth anniversary
plot.

175
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,870
It was meant to take down five to 10 
planes.

176
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:25,980
If it's exceeded,
you'd have,

177
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,843
we'd be living in a different world.
There'd be 600 or more dead Americans 

178
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:30,624
and Brits lying in the Atlantic Ocean 
and we'd probably be occupying the 

179
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:36,210
federally administered tribal areas and 
in engaged in a very vicious,

180
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:37,044
a counter insurgency campaign.
But that's been their most ambitious 

181
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:41,370
plot since.
And it's,

182
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:44,130
it's a couple of orders of magnitude 
short of nine 11.

183
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,600
So I think they'll probably,
I mean,

184
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,160
bin Ladin keeps an eye.
Al Kind keeps an eye on the calendar.

185
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:50,994
They know this is an election season.
I think he'll probably want to do 

186
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:54,504
something in 2004 what we can see in 
retrospect is that he didn't have the 

187
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:00,660
capability to do anything other than a 
media event,

188
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,943
but he appeared like an apparition on 
the weekend before the election and 

189
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,430
delivered this message to the American 
people.

190
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:09,264
John Kerry's still believes that this 
day was a factor in his defeat in a 

191
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:13,140
close election.
So at a minimum,

192
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:18,170
I expect them to attempt media events,
but if they have capability of,

193
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,720
they'll probably will use it during the 
fall season.

194
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,554
Yeah.
