1
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:08,950
I just think that the,

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,290
the criminal line withdrawn way too far.
I mean,

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,760
uh,
my,

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,470
uh,
my colleagues and friends who are in the

5
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:17,530
Chicano movement in the southwest often
say,

6
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:19,090
look,
we didn't cross the border.

7
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:20,680
The border crossed us,
right?

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,960
We were here then.
Then America came,

9
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:24,630
so don't call us immigrants.
Well,

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,500
similar thing happened with crime,
right?

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,110
It's not so much that we became more
criminal,

12
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,490
is that more things became criminal.
One way to think about it is that during

13
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:34,780
Jim Crow,
right?

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,710
Simply being black in public space with
criminal activity,

15
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,640
right?
So going to a movie theater and sitting

16
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:46,240
in the downstairs instead of upstairs
was a crime,

17
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,640
right?
Drinking out of the wrong water fountain

18
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:51,040
was a crime.
Fitting in the front of the bus was a

19
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,500
crime.
Now we look at those things now and

20
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:54,250
think,
well that's,

21
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,600
that's ridiculous,
right?

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,000
The d,
these are clearly just patterns of

23
00:00:58,001 --> 00:00:59,620
people's lives and behavior.

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,130
These are things that we think of is
freedom of choice and the right to

25
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:05,920
assemble.
And so how could we have thought of them

26
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:08,590
as criminals?
So the the line of what constitutes

27
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:12,130
crime is socially constructed can move
back and forward.

28
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:14,350
Right.
My parent's relationship with the

29
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:19,060
criminal relationship in the state of
Virginia where I grew up three years

30
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:22,270
before we came there,
so I mean three years before we moved to

31
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:25,150
Virginia,
my parents relationship was in fact a

32
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:30,151
criminal relationship.
So what I know for certain is that we

33
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:35,230
can change what constitutes crime.
And then in doing so we don't make a

34
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:38,650
world that is more dangerous.
I think we actually make a world that is

35
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:43,651
more free so we can say that we are as
unconcerned with inner city high school

36
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:51,271
kids smoking pot at the bus stop as we
are about Princeton kids getting drunk

37
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:53,800
to the point of killing brain cells.

38
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,500
Every Thursday night we can just simply
say,

39
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:59,680
you know what?
These are not activities that make us

40
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:01,930
afraid.
We are not afraid of young people were

41
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:05,260
not afraid of the choices that they're
making that we don't have to police

42
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:07,780
every single activity to the point of
incarceration,

43
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,960
that we can have laws on the book that
stamps sort of our,

44
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,360
our social code.
About what matters,

45
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,510
but that we do not have to police them
at the same level.

46
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,600
We don't in fact have to kind of fill
our jails with people who are doing

47
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,470
petty property,
excuse me,

48
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:24,700
petty drug crime,
right?

49
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,170
Petty drug crime does not require the
kinds of massive incarceration that it's

50
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:32,560
currently getting.
We can talk about property crime,

51
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:34,300
we can talk about sort of,
um,

52
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,530
you know,
physical crimes,

53
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,450
a rape and,
but those things,

54
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:40,690
by the way,
have all been into Kline as we have

55
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:43,990
grown our prison population in terms of
petty drug crime.

56
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,280
There is no war on drugs is a war on
sort of petty drug users.

57
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:51,100
And I think we could,
we could make a choice not to be in that

58
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:51,460
war.
