1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,540
You can't develop a perfect system.
Somebody's gonna fall through the

2
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:08,130
street,
through the cracks,

3
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:11,400
but they fall through the cracks in
Europe and Canada

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,780
below it.
I'm just saying this,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I like our system of innovation.
I like to fight who mapped the human

6
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:23,040
genome we did in America,
uh,

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,500
who's the one that discovered,
you know,

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,770
all the vast majority of new drugs in
the last five years that are so helpful

9
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,230
to curing illnesses,
Americans,

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,470
American research labs and American
companies.

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,610
A lot of the research companies are
coming to America because we do have a

12
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:46,611
cost structure that allow a company to
recoup their investment of their

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,330
research when it costs to take a drug
from the laboratory to the bedside.

14
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,480
And this is very important.
And,

15
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:57,660
uh,
I don't think you will find that kind of

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,840
support and they in a European system.
And that's why I think it's so important

17
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:07,830
for us to keep our,
our own competitive system.
