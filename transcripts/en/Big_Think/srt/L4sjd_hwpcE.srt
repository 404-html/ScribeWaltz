1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,060
You know,
I think the funny thing is at one point

2
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:11,450
in time I would have really sought and
definition,

3
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:14,270
I wouldn't have really sought to say
that I identify with these set of people

4
00:00:14,271 --> 00:00:19,100
more that identity and what has always
happened when I've tried to do that has

5
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:20,450
been,
you know,

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,820
being essentially slapped in the face
and look,

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,410
it's not that simple and it shouldn't
be,

8
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:26,330
that's important.
If you do try to simplify it,

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,210
you're doing great harm to yourself and
your understanding of the world.

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:30,200
So,
you know,

11
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:33,800
at this point in time I sort of put that
to the side and said,

12
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:35,690
you know what,
the characterizations,

13
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:39,230
the definitions are going to come and
whoever it is that's going to,

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,740
to,
to want you to fall into particular

15
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:44,420
line,
whether it for whatever purpose is going

16
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:46,100
to,
they're going to do that regardless of

17
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:46,610
what you say.

18
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,920
So for you,
you have to create that open space for

19
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:51,730
yourself.
And that space is not one or the other.

20
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:52,960
It will never be one or the other.
It's,

21
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:53,410
um,
it's,

22
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,730
it's a space that's,
that's infused with so many things.

23
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:58,250
But I think what's great about that as
well is that,

24
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,660
you know,
being,

25
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,460
being Nigerian and being American rate,
you understand,

26
00:01:04,461 --> 00:01:05,750
I don't think you begin to understand
that,

27
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,491
that it,
it,

28
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:08,720
it gets really,
really absurd because of being American,

29
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:11,540
right?
Is being influenced by so many different

30
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,880
cultures.
So many different traditions that have

31
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:15,550
come into this country from,
you know,

32
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:19,460
whether they were here to start with or
whether they have come in through

33
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:20,300
immigrants,
right.

34
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,510
Uh,
being Nigerian is very much the same

35
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:26,300
because the idea of being Nigerian is
influenced by all the different groups

36
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:28,070
and cultures and subcultures that go on.

37
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,810
And then you add to the fact that
there's a whole relation between Nigeria

38
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:34,010
and for example,
the UK,

39
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:38,840
which colonized in Nigeria and then now
growing connections between Nigeria and

40
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:40,340
the United States,
right?

41
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,370
And American culture through,
whether it's through hip hop music or

42
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:44,270
movies,
films,

43
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,280
whatever,
have come in and are now starting to

44
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:48,650
influence the way that people think.
So the idea of what it means to be

45
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:50,390
Nigerian is actually,
it's a very,

46
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:51,890
it's a very fractured thing.
It's a,

47
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:53,960
it's a Malandra things.
And it just,

48
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,040
it seems different.
Okay.

49
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:58,400
Because everybody in Nigeria tends to
have brown skin,

50
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,220
right?
That doesn't necessarily mean everyone's

51
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,080
the same.
Here you see the differences more,

52
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,280
right?
But at the same time,

53
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:05,480
people like to,
to,

54
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,610
to sort of smooth over that with,
oh,

55
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:08,930
we're American.
But you know,

56
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:10,580
American again is so many different
things.

57
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:11,690
And you know,
in the end,

58
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,970
if I say I'm American,
what does that mean that I am,

59
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,250
that means I've taken bits and pieces
from this.

60
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:19,010
I've taken bits and pieces from that and
put it into this identity.

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,061
So I just,
you know,

62
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:23,510
I'd say like for purposes of,
of travel and characterization,

63
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:24,830
right?
If I have to show a passport,

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,190
I'll show which passport is most
necessary,

65
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,800
but when it comes down to what I think I
am and how I perceive myself,

66
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:32,100
I think,
you know,

67
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,920
acknowledging that it's,
it's a whole,

68
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,090
like a multiplicity of things allows me
to better relate to myself and to other

69
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:44,240
people and to,
to better deal with the world as a

70
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:44,930
whole.
I think.
