1
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,613
Well,
it's been

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,600
two ways that the,
that this economic expansion,

3
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:18,601
it's subsidized by the environment,
one is just the sort of non market

4
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:22,390
consequences,
most notably say greenhouse gas

5
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:25,900
pollution at the all of us who use that
pollution,

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:30,901
but those who sell it to us,
particularly your responsible for a huge

7
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:35,110
environmental impact that they are not
paying for a,

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,670
but they're also,
that problem is compounded by the

9
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:44,671
addition of subsidies by governments.
And there's one estimate that the

10
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:50,161
environmentally perverse subsidies
internationally now amount to perhaps a

11
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,110
eight,
at least $800,000,000,000 a year.

12
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,840
And a,
this is an energy.

13
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:03,841
It's an agriculture and transportation
and that further distorts the price

14
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,470
mechanism.
And as a result,

15
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,050
we have these environmentally dishonest
prices.

16
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,670
This basic system then is compounded by
three other things.

17
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,310
Uh,
first is an enormous,

18
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,240
um,
is the way that corporations are set up.

19
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,240
We've now charter corporations and
established corporate law,

20
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,580
uh,
that says in effect,

21
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,000
uh,
the overwhelming duty of the corporation

22
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:36,670
is to maximize the wealth of the
shareholders.

23
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,130
This is the so called shareholder
primacy,

24
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,650
best interest of the corporation
principle.

25
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,580
Uh,
it's totally outmoded and in my view,

26
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,620
I mean we ought to be exploring
rigorously a system where the

27
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,490
corporation is governed by and beholding
to all of those that contribute to the

28
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:01,750
wealth that the shareholder,
that the cooperation produces.

29
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,910
And that would include local
communities,

30
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,910
it would include workers,
uh,

31
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,790
so it's a fundamental change in the way
that corporations are set up and the

32
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:14,791
incentives that they operate under.
The second pillar of this is less,

33
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,740
uh,
is our,

34
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,580
uh,
our pathetic capitulation to

35
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,590
consumerism.
Uh,

36
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,370
and that's,
of course it's manipulated endlessly by

37
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:31,990
advertisers and,
and marketing and we succumb easily,

38
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,700
uh,
and,

39
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,600
and,
and,

40
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,080
and off we go,
uh,

41
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,790
and that is certainly a huge pillar of
the system.

42
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,530
The,
the third,

43
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,540
a is government itself.
The state,

44
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,020
the state can raise extra revenues
without raising tax rates by growing a,

45
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,290
it can keep social issues on the back
burner by pointing to the expansion of

46
00:02:56,651 --> 00:03:00,500
the economy as a solution to social,
uh,

47
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,460
growth enhances the projection of power,
uh,

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,840
in international,
in a competitive international system.

49
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,290
So governments that are deeply hooked on
growth.

50
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,280
So this is the basic complex and it's
enormously powerful.

51
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,910
And the environmental community,
um,

52
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,200
this is simply a unable to cope with the
full burden of that system.

53
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,093
Well

54
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,240
already clear that if we had a world
that had environmentally honest prices

55
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:39,010
and indeed socially honest prices and
militarily honest prices,

56
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,440
prices would be a lot higher,
a lot higher,

57
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,670
both in general.
So the reaction of people would be to

58
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:48,370
shift good,
shift their activities out of the

59
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:51,160
market,
which in many ways is a wonderful thing

60
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:54,250
because it means we would be spending
more time with our families,

61
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:57,610
more time with our communities,
more time with the natural world.

62
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,790
And it would also mean the activities
that are environmentally destructive

63
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,040
would cost a lot more,
a lot more.

64
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,790
Uh,
and the effect of this is to,

65
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,740
um,
you know,

66
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,070
shift our consumer patterns towards
things that are environmentally

67
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,520
regenerative or benign.
Um,

68
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,120
but they're huge equity issues here.
Uh,

69
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,770
we,
um,

70
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,930
and that's why in the book I really,
um,

71
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,180
go approach in several ways,
the link between dealing with our

72
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,040
environmental issues and dealing with
the social justice issues in our

73
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:36,874
country.

74
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:41,350
Um,
we have a crisis of social inequality in

75
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:43,510
America as well as an environmental
crisis,

76
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,080
a soaring executive pay a and earnings
in is the top one percent of the

77
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:54,000
country,
um,

78
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,460
and a widening gap between the very rich
and the rest of the country.

79
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,120
Poverty rates at an all time high,
uh,

80
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,800
over 10 percent of the public facing
hunger still in our country,

81
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,470
if you can believe that,
uh,

82
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,780
in a one percent of the adult population
in jail,

83
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,460
a failing schools,
uh,

84
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,920
uh,
unprecedented proportion of the society

85
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,700
with a out health insurance,
uh,

86
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,560
and,
and just tremendous social insecurity

87
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:30,910
among most people in the country.
Half the families in the country make

88
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:35,510
less than about $45,000 a year.
The family,

89
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,520
it could be pretty big and they and,
and the average of that half is well

90
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:43,960
below 45 of course.
So basically,

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,780
you know,
we have a society with tremendous wealth

92
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:49,980
and tremendous capacity,
but it's very concentrated and it spent

93
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,650
on.

94
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,700
It's not spent on promoting social
wellbeing in our society.

95
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,641
So,
and,

96
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:57,890
and,
and the environmental pictures,

97
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,090
no prettier.
So what we really have is a system that

98
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:06,080
cares profoundly about profits and
reinvesting a large share of them and

99
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:09,620
growing.
He doesn't really care much at all about

100
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,480
people society or the natural world in
which it's embedded.

101
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:20,140
And that's why it's up to us as citizens
to use the main tool that we have,

102
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,950
which is government,
uh,

103
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,250
to inject a real values,
uh,

104
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,200
other values,
human values,

105
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:29,240
longterm values,
caring values,

106
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:32,600
compassionate values,
natural values into the system.

107
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,070
And,
and that's where we fail too often and

108
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:42,071
failed in a big way because our politics
are so enfeebled today,

109
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,310
uh,
and the corporate control of our

110
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:48,470
politics is,
is so strong,

111
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,280
uh,
that were failing.

112
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:54,500
And,
but the point is that we're all

113
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,840
similarly situated,
those who are trying to succeed in,

114
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,970
in,
in projecting values for about future

115
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:06,620
generations and about the natural world
into that system are failing just for

116
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:11,621
the same reasons that those who are
trying to project into that system or

117
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,400
inject into that system values about
social justice and social wellbeing and

118
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:18,360
social cohesion,
uh,

119
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,940
in our country and the same.

120
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,100
And so we all have,
uh,

121
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,850
we're,
we're,

122
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,121
we're,
uh,

123
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:30,440
communities of shared fate,
and yet we're not talking to each other.
