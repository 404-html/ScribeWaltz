1
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,970
Uh,
I think collectively we should be all

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,750
together at the table much more often
than we are because I think that the

3
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:19,751
table is a such a magnet for interaction
from the family onto world issues.

4
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,220
Uh,
it's Ford is a conduit to a venue that

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,540
we can sort of permeate each other's
thoughts and all that.

6
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,240
So at the table,
beginning with the family and the

7
00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:37,820
family,
eating together to the leaders,

8
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,670
eating each other's food at the table
and maybe discussing,

9
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:41,931
uh,
the point,

10
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:46,931
an issue over a nice bowl of pasta.
I think individually we should have a

11
00:00:49,101 --> 00:00:52,040
consciousness of herself,
of her body,

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,460
of living well and using food to get
them in a positive fashion.

13
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:02,480
You know,
using food to give us pleasure using

14
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:07,510
food to lose those few pounds.
Enjoyably not in a negative negotiation

15
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:13,030
because I think today food is a negated
a lot,

16
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,211
you know?
No,

17
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:14,700
no,
no.

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,860
Instead,
food is yes,

19
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:16,461
yes,
yes.

20
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:19,520
It's the right food is the right amount
at the right time.
