1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,423
Mm.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:11,090
Was a case recently in Florida where a
teenager was arrested for murder.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,460
He was a student at the University of
Florida and he was accused of murdering

4
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:18,860
his roommate and best friend.
They were living together for three

5
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:23,861
months and after three months he killed
his best friend and roommate because the

6
00:00:24,141 --> 00:00:28,760
murderer had a girlfriend and the
girlfriend dumped the murderer for the

7
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:29,930
roommate.
As it turns out,

8
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:31,940
when the kid murdered his roommate,
he had a problem.

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,670
He didn't know where to bury the dead
body.

10
00:00:34,671 --> 00:00:38,060
But as an 18 year old millennial,
he knew where to get an answer to his

11
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:39,440
question.
He asked Siri,

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,790
where can I bury a dead body?
And it turns out Siri answered his

13
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:48,440
question and proposed mines,
dumps reservoirs,

14
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,000
swamps,
and rivers.

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,550
So if you ask Siri where to bury a dead
body,

16
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:55,250
she will give you answers to these
questions.

17
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,750
So in the old days,
you know,

18
00:00:56,751 --> 00:01:00,920
we used to talk about Bonnie and Clyde,
but we've entered the age of Siri and

19
00:01:00,921 --> 00:01:03,950
Clyde were clearly algorithms will be
unnamed,

20
00:01:03,951 --> 00:01:07,460
co-conspirators and younger criminals
carrying out attacks.

21
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,150
A,
I is being used across the board in our

22
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:14,030
society via Algorithms.
Right?

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,140
And in fact most of these algorithms are
what are called black box algorithms.

24
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,850
There's a harvard professor called Frank
Pasquali who wrote a whole book on black

25
00:01:22,851 --> 00:01:27,200
box algorithms that talks about how
little we know about these algorithms

26
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:30,020
and what some of the dangers might be.
For example,

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,600
there's an algorithm that determines
your credit score,

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,210
fico,
what goes into it.

29
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,800
Exactly.
And precisely,

30
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,340
nobody knows.
There's an algorithm that determines who

31
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:43,490
gets selected for secondary screening at
the airport.

32
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,960
Maybe it's because you bought a one way
ticket babies cause she paid for cash.

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,680
Maybe it's because you have the wrong
religion or the wrong skin color,

34
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:52,190
right?

35
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:57,080
We don't know clearly at all what is
being encoded into these algorithms and

36
00:01:57,081 --> 00:02:00,290
so that opens up the door for them to be
abused.

37
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:04,040
We saw a examples of this on Wall Street
with Flash Boys,

38
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,410
right on rapid,
uh,

39
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,510
trading on Wall Street.
The fact of the matter is only a

40
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:12,050
minuscule amount of trading on Wall
Street is carried out by human beings.

41
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,340
The overwhelming majority of trading is
algorithmic in nature.

42
00:02:16,341 --> 00:02:20,060
It's preprogrammed so that if the price
of soybeans go down,

43
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,640
all of these additional steps will take
place.

44
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:26,810
If some event happens in the world,
traders will buy or sell based upon that

45
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:30,980
information and it all goes so fast.
There's no time for human intervention,

46
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:35,981
and we saw an implication of this
recently when the Associated Press,

47
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:40,580
twitter feed was hacked a few years ago.
Somebody took over the official AP

48
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:43,790
twitter feed and they put out a tweet
from the official site that said,

49
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,850
breaking news explosions at the White
House.

50
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,690
President Obama injured.
Now it turns out that never happened,

51
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,650
but all of the algorithms that are
monitoring the net looking for the

52
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:58,130
latest news that they can trade on,
picked up on it immediately from a

53
00:02:58,131 --> 00:03:02,410
trusted source and because they
perceived a terrorist attack that caused

54
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:07,030
the market a massive,
massive sell off in just three minutes.

55
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,060
Because of this one tweet,
the market fell $136 billion,

56
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,810
$136 billion evaluation was evaporated
in 180 seconds just because of one we

57
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,040
would tweet.
Now that was carried out by an

58
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,710
organization known as the Syrian
electronic army.

59
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,590
They're back trained and funded by the
Iranian government.

60
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,440
Now in this particular case,
they did that for the purposes of

61
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,300
mischief,
but they also could have shorted the

62
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:37,780
market at the same time and made a lot
of money on this.

63
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,070
So our algorithms are going way faster
than we realize and they're running

64
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:43,780
things that we don't even understand.

65
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,510
For example,
when you go for an MRI exam in the

66
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:50,020
hospital,
that Mri via its algorithms are actually

67
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,500
interpreting the data for your
radiologist in many ways before they

68
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:57,070
even read that.
When you fly on autopilot on an

69
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,650
airplane,
which is probably more than 90% of your

70
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:02,080
flight,
it's an algorithm that's running the

71
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:06,550
plane and all of those can be hacked.
Much of the attacks that occur in

72
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:09,250
cyberspace,
whether they be virus attacks,

73
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:12,340
ransomware,
denial of service attacks are all

74
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,050
scripted to run,
which means a computer hacker or a

75
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,470
criminal writes some code and the code
goes off and carries out the crime,

76
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:24,190
which means crime can scale and it can
scale exponentially.

77
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,890
And that's why we've seen some massive
uptick.

78
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,220
Yeah.
