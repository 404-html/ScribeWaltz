1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,540
No,
I finished up a celebrity apprentice.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,980
I finished,
uh,

3
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:08,070
I came home,
um,

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,293
I had,
uh,

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,580
a book of my reading list that was a
Daniel Kahneman's book thinking fast and

6
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,870
slow,
opened it up and started reading and

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,030
realized I was reading kind of two
things at once.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,680
An explanation of what I gone through on
celebrity apprentice and the best magic

9
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:28,350
book I ever read.
I don't think the annual condom and knew

10
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:31,080
he was riding a magic book.
I don't think he knew he was running

11
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,060
about celebrity apprentice,
but he might have,

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,220
when I was on celebrity apprentice,
I would see people who I knew fairly

13
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:39,820
well,
uh,

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,480
and I would see them acting in ways that
I found a wrong for their personalities,

15
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:50,430
inappropriate.
Uh,

16
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:51,620
I found,
um,

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,430
embarrassing at times and I couldn't
figure out why when you're outside of

18
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,230
the whole thing you say,
well,

19
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:00,900
they must be giving them a lot of
alcohol,

20
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:04,800
which alcohol is always available,
but most people in my team didn't drink.

21
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,390
So that doesn't work.
So maybe you're telling people that

22
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,840
crazy because it'll make better TV.
That wasn't happening either.

23
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,660
No one ever talked to me about that and
then I read,

24
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:18,480
and this is not economists work,
he was quoting someone else.

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,310
He just kind of brought it together for
me.

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,030
He talked about a ego depletion,
ego exhaustion,

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,560
and it turns out that if you just put
cameras on someone like you're doing to

28
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:33,561
me here and you asked them to talk,
they will speak a little clearer,

29
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:37,080
a little better,
a little more carefully than they would

30
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:41,730
if there were no cameras around,
but that only works up to a point and we

31
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:45,300
tend to think of or I always tended to
think about a new data about anybody

32
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:47,550
else.
I always tended to think of some

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,820
willpower as a character trait.
My mom would talk about,

34
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,611
you know,
pen,

35
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:55,770
you have to have willpower,
willpower,

36
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:56,040
you have.

37
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,010
Self control was very,
very important to my family,

38
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,800
very important and I thought of as a
character trait.

39
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,560
This is something that maybe I'm born
with some of it,

40
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,860
but I also want to develop and the mind
blowing thing about thinking fast and

41
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:15,360
slow reading that book was that it is
not a character trait.

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,410
It is not a,
a,

43
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,470
a quality,
it's a,

44
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,380
uh,
it's a muscle,

45
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,190
the ego,
the sensor that the,

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,940
the,
the thoughtful part of us that controls

47
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,340
us,
the self control is something that

48
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:37,050
requires effort and a lot of effort and
after you've used that for awhile,

49
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,330
if they may,
if you make someone very,

50
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:43,500
very careful about what they say,
four hours,

51
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,560
they walk by a piece of chocolate cake
and they're on a diet,

52
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:50,350
they'll still eat the chocolate cake.
When I was on celebrity apprentice with

53
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:53,820
the camera's on me all the time and
carefully watching my move,

54
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,050
I did not make any attempt to eat
healthy cheeseburger,

55
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:00,490
French fries every single lunch.

56
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,990
I just don't have the energy to use
myself control that way.

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,580
And for me,
when my ego breaks down,

58
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,440
when selfcontrol goes away,
I actually get very quiet.

59
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,420
What I tend to do is shut up and if you
watched celebrity apprentice,

60
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:23,410
as the day goes on,
I am a less provocative.

61
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,110
I am less confrontational when I am well
rested and working and full of self

62
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:34,600
control.
I am very aggressive.

63
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:38,020
It's what I do for a living.
When I get tired,

64
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,380
I get quieter.
I don't have conflicts with people.

65
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,630
I have to push,
uh,

66
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:45,850
to be an asshole.
Um,

67
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,320
other people who were very,
very nice and was images were very nice.

68
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,550
Uh,
the,

69
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,383
I mean they're,
um,

70
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,020
they're a public image,
is very pleasant and sweet.

71
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,570
After these cameras were on them,
you know,

72
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,200
for a five,
six hours,

73
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,820
all of a sudden that what I'm calling a
muscle,

74
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,420
that selfcontrol would just be exhausted
and they would just spew out anything

75
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:14,770
was popping into their heads,
really angry,

76
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:16,960
squabbling and yelling and pressure.

77
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,570
And it was a fascinating way to look at
it.

78
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,630
And it never crossed my mind that what
was happening was not some sort of

79
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:27,700
mental illness,
but simply a kind of,

80
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,110
um,
uh,

81
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,310
lack of,
uh,

82
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,130
selfcontrol caused simply by this ego
exhaustion,

83
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,430
which is very different.
I'm not saying that well,

84
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,140
the way I understood condiments book or
the section of the book is,

85
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:48,250
is not that they were physically tired
or even mentally tired,

86
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,570
but that self control,
that ego part was tired.

87
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,480
That part that says you will kind of
want to do this,

88
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,030
but you should probably do that.
Um,

89
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,370
it was fascinating.
And I,

90
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,190
the first thing I did when I read the
Daniel Kahneman book was I bought copies

91
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:06,240
for all the producers on celebrity
apprentice and send it to him.

92
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:06,521
He said,
oh,

93
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:07,750
by the way,
this is what you're doing.

94
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,870
You know,
and it's very funny that condom and

95
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:15,550
talks about all these studies that have
been done where they put people in a

96
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:20,551
room with TV cameras and had them do
tasks to watch how they acted and said,

97
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:22,570
you know,
they could have just saved a lot of

98
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,400
time.
They could have just turned on the

99
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:28,090
television.
Almost every show is a reality show and

100
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:30,090
they're all based on that technique
that,

101
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,600
that kind of Anti Hawthorne effect that
after your watched for a little while,

102
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,000
you do better.
And then it all falls apart.
