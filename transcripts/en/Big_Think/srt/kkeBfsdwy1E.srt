1
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,060
As part of big think mentor,
which is,

2
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:11,990
um,
big things,

3
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:16,991
lifelong learning channel on Youtube.
I'm Jason Gods and we're very,

4
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:19,820
very happy today to be joined by Maria
Konnikova,

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,780
author of mastermind,
how to think like Sherlock Holmes in her

6
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:27,560
workshop on big think mentor.
She teaches thinking skills from the

7
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:32,561
masters sleuth including observation
deduction and imaginative problem

8
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:35,750
solving among others.
And we're here as a followup to that

9
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:39,350
workshop with Sin Burgess who's a member
of big think,

10
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:40,760
mentors,
learning community.

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,080
Uh,
welcome Maria.

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,280
We're delighted that you're here.

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,230
Thank you so much for having me.
I'm excited for this.

14
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:48,120
I've never done a google plus hanging
out before,

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,560
so,
um,

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,860
and this is our first ever,
so bear with us if there's background

17
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:56,830
noise or any other technical
interruptions or you know,

18
00:00:56,831 --> 00:01:01,831
suddenly the Google plus animation of a
mustache or you're on one of us.

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,300
Um,
so I think what we'll do,

20
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:05,290
we'll start with,
you know,

21
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:09,160
essentially this is a follow on to
Maria's workshop on mentor,

22
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:12,400
which is called how to think like a
Sherlock Holmes.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,440
You can get there by going to
youtube.com/user/big thing mentor.

24
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,590
And we're asking followup questions.
Um,

25
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,310
I have some questions.
We've got other questions from members

26
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:27,160
of mentors community and we'll start
with,

27
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,390
um,
sid,

28
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,990
uh,
and said if you'd like to introduce

29
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:36,630
yourself would say a couple of words
about what brought you to mentor or

30
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,151
what,
you know,

31
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:37,990
what,
what you're,

32
00:01:37,991 --> 00:01:39,520
what you're up to.
Um,

33
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,390
and then,
uh,

34
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,580
and then go ahead and ask Maria your
questions.

35
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,220
Yeah,
I saw just,

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,053
I think

37
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,930
Sid Burgess,
I think I'm just kind of addicted to the

38
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:51,230
notion of trying to,
um,

39
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,810
hone a personal skills to try to,
you know,

40
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,950
improve your life and day to day,
uh,

41
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,890
just I enjoy the topic in general.
So I've been a big fan of,

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,410
uh,
of the channel and even before you guys,

43
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:02,630
uh,
uh,

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,370
went to a big thing for mentors.
I'm really kind of excited to be a part

45
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:06,570
of this.
Um,

46
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,120
yeah,
I had a question just to kind of kick

47
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:10,860
things off.
I really was curious,

48
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:11,723
uh,
what,

49
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,490
uh,
some of the mentors was wanting to get

50
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:17,320
out of this whole experience themselves.
Uh,

51
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:19,800
we,
we sort of are used to kind of receiving

52
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:22,920
this feedback or receiving this,
these good ideas,

53
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:24,840
but part of a,
part of the,

54
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:26,700
uh,
part of the brilliance of this whole

55
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:29,790
kind of community is,
is that everybody's kind of is getting

56
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,310
something out of it too as well.
So I was just kind of curious from your

57
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,560
what,
what are you looking to get out of a big

58
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:35,394
thing to mentor?

59
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,430
Well,
I'm looking to get out of it.

60
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:40,580
That's a wonderful question.
Questions just like the one that you

61
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:43,640
asked.
So when you really have,

62
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,820
um,
people who interact with you and who ask

63
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,490
new questions,
you've look at things in a different way

64
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:53,300
and it makes you think about topics that
you wouldn't think about otherwise,

65
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:55,880
which I think is really important.
So when I,

66
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,100
whenever I answer questions from
readers,

67
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:00,850
whenever I give talks,
answer questions from the audience,

68
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,871
there's,
you know,

69
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:05,140
there are always questions that repeat,
but there's always something new.

70
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,210
And I say,
Huh,

71
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,540
that's really interesting.
And then I start thinking about it and

72
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:14,200
it lets me develop my ideas.
It's kind of like the Holmes Watson

73
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:16,000
relationship actually to,
uh,

74
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,750
kind of bring it back to that.
I think that Watson really improves

75
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:23,500
Holmes's thinking and Holmes becomes
much better throughout the stories.

76
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:28,000
The more he interacts with Watson
because Watson asks provocative

77
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:31,210
questions,
he always forces homes to stop and think

78
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,200
why he's doing what he's doing.
And that kind of back and forth is

79
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:36,890
incredibly important,
um,

80
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,820
to keep your thinking sharp,
to keep yourself stimulated.

81
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,660
I don't think that anyone should ever
really work in a bathroom even though

82
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,620
writing is often a very solitary
profession.

83
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,190
But that interaction I think is
incredibly important.

84
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,810
Jason,
you want me ask my second question?

85
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,590
Absolutely.
Alright,

86
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,900
so the second one,
uh,

87
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,780
is,
uh,

88
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,290
it's one of the,
I've actually had a kind of mulling

89
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,020
around in my mind for a while as this
notion of,

90
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,790
of being too distracted and multitasking
and you brought it up in one of your

91
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,380
video.
So I really wanted to ask you this

92
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:14,630
specifically.
I enjoy going.

93
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,230
That's my favorite place in the world.
It really doesn't matter which one it

94
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:19,580
is,
is the coffee shop.

95
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,850
I just enjoy sitting in the coffee shop
and just kind of watching the world go

96
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:25,370
by and people watching as we like to
say,

97
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:28,820
but almost more than that too.
I just enjoy kind of just a,

98
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:32,990
almost in a sense of meditation,
just taking in all the sights and sounds

99
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:37,100
of whatever city that I'm in and trying
to process them almost simultaneously.

100
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,560
So I wanted to just ask you how,
how would you,

101
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,360
how would you describe maybe in a way
that would help help improve that,

102
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,890
uh,
that mental,

103
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,670
uh,
exercise and the way that differentiates

104
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:54,230
that from kind of the multitasking or
the endorphin driven kind of electronic

105
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,970
distraction?
Um,

106
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,410
uh,
that we hear a lot about.

107
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,450
Can you kind of,
you can maybe differentiate the two a

108
00:04:59,451 --> 00:05:01,390
little bit and maybe how we can focus it
on,

109
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,293
on the better one?

110
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,190
Sure.
So what you like to do is definitely not

111
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,550
multitasking.
Um,

112
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,040
that's kind of unitasking at its best
because you're doing something very

113
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,650
specific.
You're kind of watching or letting your

114
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:16,320
senses take everything in.
So I think the,

115
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,960
the myth about multitasking,
you,

116
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,490
you can't be looking at multiple things
at once and have that not be

117
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:27,810
multitasking.
You can't be doing multiple activities

118
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:29,640
at once.
So their brain can't be thinking,

119
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,320
okay,
I want to do this,

120
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:33,090
but also I want to do this.
Oh,

121
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,780
I'm watching these people.
But also I'm focused on what I'm going

122
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:40,110
to order at the coffee shop,
when I'm going to have for lunch,

123
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,750
what I'm going to do after I leave the
coffee shop,

124
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,200
what else I have planned for this city.
If you were thinking all of these things

125
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:48,300
at the same time and then you'd be
multitasking,

126
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,620
but if you're kind of in the moment and
just soaking everything in using all of

127
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:57,030
your senses,
that's really sensory taking in the,

128
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,300
in a very mindful fashion.

129
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,640
Um,
which is the purpose of,

130
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,870
uh,
of mindfulness.

131
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,920
So I think those are two very,
very different experiences.

132
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,540
And in order to really,
I think do get a lot of out of what you

133
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:15,230
do and get more out of that type of
people watching,

134
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:17,090
which by the way,
I think is really interesting and

135
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:20,480
fascinating.
And helps you develop as a,

136
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,650
as a person and develop your thinking
and develop your powers of observation

137
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,940
is really realize that that's exactly
what you're doing and do your best to

138
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:33,920
avoid distracting thoughts.
So if you see someone and that puts your

139
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:36,290
mind along the lines of,
oh,

140
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,630
hey,
that person reminds me of my friend x

141
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,450
and settling,
you're thinking about fed x in your mind

142
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:44,510
is going on a tangent,
realize that that's happening.

143
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:48,020
Stop yourself and come back to just
observing and taking everything in.

144
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,690
I think that's how you can make the most
out of that experience.

145
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,650
Okay,
great.

146
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:59,000
Um,
I have other questions from other mentor

147
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,750
members who would have liked to have
been with us today but could not for

148
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:04,010
technical reasons.
So,

149
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,540
um,
we've got Matthew J.

150
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,540
Clark is asking what are the current
theories about why tasks switching

151
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:16,740
causes fatigue?
And that's,

152
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,040
that's how he worded the question.
And unfortunately,

153
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,820
folks aren't here to do follow up,
but

154
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,610
of course,
so we know that attention is an

155
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,660
incredibly finite resource.
So there's really only so much of it to

156
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:32,230
go around and we can train our intention
so that we become better,

157
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:34,450
but we'll never be able to make it
incident.

158
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,370
And so one of the things that tasks
which in does is use that mental energy.

159
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:43,810
So you need resources to switch your
focus from one thing to another.

160
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,020
And the theory is actually is very
simple.

161
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,280
The more your mind is doing,
the more resources it needs.

162
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,210
And so every time you switch your
attention who are actually switching

163
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:57,700
circuits,
you're switching your focus,

164
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,420
you're switching kind of the neural
mechanisms behind it and that expense

165
00:08:01,421 --> 00:08:05,080
energy,
literally you can replenish it by having

166
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:06,940
glucose or other,
um,

167
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,390
other things that actually boosts your
energy levels.

168
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,820
So it's a very,
very literal thing that happens.

169
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:17,080
Your brain is actually getting tired,
you're actually using resources and

170
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:22,081
you're actually becoming less able to do
other things because you use those

171
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:26,290
resources for the task switching.
Now you no longer have them to pay

172
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,120
attention to the tasks that you're
doing.

173
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,680
There's a lot of really interesting work
that shows that people who multitask

174
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:37,681
frequently are less efficient at task
switching because they're always the,

175
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:42,430
they don't know how to take those
resources and really use them to their

176
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:45,490
full potential,
which I think is really fascinating

177
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,480
because it ends up that heavy
multitaskers become worse at the very

178
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:51,460
thing that they should be very good at.

179
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,090
Right,
right.

180
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:55,560
I've,
I've read some of that research and it's

181
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:56,970
fascinating because,
you know,

182
00:08:56,971 --> 00:09:00,780
the,
the sort of plugged in millennial folks

183
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:04,140
who you would think would be the best
step at this actually the more they

184
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:05,610
multitask,
it seems the worst.

185
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,370
Yup.
They become a worse that being able to

186
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:11,560
filter out distractions.
Um,

187
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,580
and that's a good thing if you want to
make sure that you're paying attention

188
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:18,220
to everything,
but you also get off task very,

189
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,630
very frequently in very easily,
which is not a good thing.

190
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,780
So not being able to filter out
distractions can make them worse at task

191
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:31,510
switching to the tasks you actually want
to be switching to,

192
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,120
if that makes sense.
Yeah.

193
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,971
Something I'd be like,
oh,

194
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:35,200
Hey,
there was this distraction.

195
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,400
Maybe I'll do that instead.

196
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,990
So in this regard,
do you think that sort of,

197
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:42,300
we're all doomed given the,
you know,

198
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:43,740
tech,
technological,

199
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,590
uh,
the sort of multitasking world that

200
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:50,100
folks are growing up in now?
Or are there things people can do,

201
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,270
you know,
to,

202
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,040
uh,
to counteract that?

203
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:53,970
I mean,
you know,

204
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:55,430
there's concerns about people being
addicted.

205
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,890
Sure.
No,

206
00:09:56,891 --> 00:09:58,900
I don't think we're all doing that all.
Um,

207
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:04,020
I think that technology is wonderful and
that we just need to be aware of how

208
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:08,340
much you will call it exerts on us and
how difficult that can be to avoid.

209
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,610
So what I would say is we need to learn
to train our attention.

210
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,190
Um,
because as with anything,

211
00:10:15,191 --> 00:10:19,510
attention is like a muscle.
It's an analogy that you hear all over

212
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:21,490
and over until they college is self
control.

213
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,870
Like a muscle,
you know,

214
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:24,340
everything.
Basically you can say,

215
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,990
hey,
it's like a muscle because it's an

216
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:28,930
analogy that works incredibly well.
So if you train it,

217
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:30,640
it gets stronger,
it gets better.

218
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,840
You are able to know why ticking.
You have more endurance.

219
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:39,940
And similarly with attention,
the more you train yourself to the task

220
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:43,030
and to only pay attention to one thing
at a time,

221
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,960
the longer and longer and longer you're
able to maintain your focus.

222
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,230
So what's happening when people say that
they cannot pay attention is that they

223
00:10:52,331 --> 00:10:56,860
haven't trained their attention.
They've forgotten what it is to have a

224
00:10:56,861 --> 00:11:00,190
single minded focus.
And because they haven't trained it,

225
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:01,930
their attention actually has gotten
worse.

226
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,410
So I think that people know when they
say they cannot pay attention,

227
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:07,740
they really can't.
It doesn't just happen over night.

228
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:13,030
Um,
and so what we can do is try to monitor

229
00:11:13,031 --> 00:11:16,570
ourselves and really learn to do one
thing at a time.

230
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,850
For me that's,
um,

231
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,280
there's been a lot that I've had to do
to actually maximize my own potential.

232
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,930
When I was writing mastermind,
I realized how Internet addicted I was

233
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,880
and I actually needed to install,
um,

234
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,390
freedom,
which is an internet blocking software

235
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:37,390
on my computer so that I wouldn't go
online.

236
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,380
And it was really hard for me.
But eventually I was able to stay off

237
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:43,540
mine for four or five hours at a time.

238
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,490
Um,
and I turned my phone off because

239
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:47,600
otherwise it'd be too tempted to,
uh,

240
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,390
check my internet on the iphone because
unfortunately,

241
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:55,110
freedom doesn't it get blocked all of
your devices and now I don't really need

242
00:11:55,111 --> 00:12:00,111
it as often because I,
I know I do it and I've already trained

243
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:04,860
myself not to.
It's still nice once in a while.

244
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:09,270
I think we all need to give ourselves
mental breaks and realize that the

245
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:13,540
Internet is your fault,
but sometimes it's good to just focus

246
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,230
and not let those email notifications,
those twitter notification.

247
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:20,090
Yeah.
All of those things that can just sucker

248
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,410
attention.
No,

249
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,610
not,
not them interfere.

250
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,370
Gotcha.
And speaking of attention for our

251
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:30,090
viewers,
the noise that sounds like the ocean is

252
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:32,370
a most likely some,
you know,

253
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:34,980
Maria lives in a fairly noisy
neighborhood.

254
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,700
Nothing we can really do about that.
So that's what that is.

255
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,751
Um,
okay.

256
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:42,630
Let me continue with people's questions
because I could,

257
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,950
I could do followups here all day.
Um,

258
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,460
Matthew also asks,
how can you habituate an input from one

259
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:55,461
sense so that it does not interfere with
the attention you give to another sense.

260
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,940
For example,
reading body language while having a

261
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:00,990
conversation?

262
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,810
Well,
I think that there are actually two

263
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:06,920
different issues here.
Um,

264
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,823
habituation.
Yeah.

265
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:12,610
Is it very specific term when it comes
to psychology and you don't do it,

266
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,520
it just happens.
It's something that's incredibly,

267
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,010
incredibly natural.
So as soon as it,

268
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,380
as there's a stimulus that you're
hearing,

269
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,740
often you'd be,
you do become habituated to it.

270
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,510
Um,
so for instance,

271
00:13:25,511 --> 00:13:28,600
one of my favorite examples comes from
my personal experience.

272
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,060
Um,
my freshman year of college,

273
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:36,090
I had a huge church right outside my
windows and the bells would ring and I'm

274
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,320
weekends.
It bells would ring.

275
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:40,510
And I was a college freshman.
I wanted to sleep.

276
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,900
Um,
and at first they always wake me up and

277
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,490
I got to the point where I didn't even
hear them.

278
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,850
I didn't realize that was for,
um,

279
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,230
we're ringing.
And it's not that I made a conscious

280
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:55,231
effort to habituate your brain learns to
lock out the noises that if serious all

281
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:59,500
the time and the same can be true of
vision.

282
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,150
So that's why you often,
you know,

283
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:02,710
if we tell us,
if you asked me,

284
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,970
no,
what do I pass on my waist work every

285
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,500
day,
I might not be able to answer think,

286
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,150
oh,
I know exactly what I pass,

287
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:13,960
but because I do it every day,
I don't pay attention to it because I've

288
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:17,780
become habituated to all those sites and
I may not,

289
00:14:17,781 --> 00:14:21,730
it may not even notice that a store has
closed or in the store has opened in its

290
00:14:21,731 --> 00:14:26,410
stead unless something draws my
attention to it and I'm out of my

291
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,190
situated,
um,

292
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,310
state.
So it just happens.

293
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,320
And what region do is actually not
habituated ourselves and try to is we

294
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:40,321
don't want to,
the active part is not habituation but

295
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,420
with standing habituation,
if that makes sense.

296
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,150
Gotcha.
Okay.

297
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,450
Okay.
Um,

298
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,800
so one other question from another
mentor member,

299
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,400
John.
Francoise,

300
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,250
Noel,
um,

301
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,320
asks Watson is really helpful to homes.
Do you have tools or ideas for,

302
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,240
you know,
solutions to create our own imaginary

303
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:10,241
watson or other ways to get a similar
benefit without having a watson if you

304
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:11,804
don't have one?

305
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,980
Yeah,
that's uh,

306
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,090
it's interesting and I'd stopped short
of saying have imaginary people

307
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:21,530
conversations in your heads just because
that you could take that a little bit

308
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:25,040
too far,
but you can learn to kind of argue with

309
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,120
yourself and to always,
um,

310
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,650
that's actually how I get a lot of my
thinking done.

311
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,030
You know,
I say,

312
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,440
okay,
this is what I think,

313
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,151
what,
what,

314
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:37,220
what's the counter argument to that?
Or why do I think that way?

315
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,450
So force yourself almost to be in a
debate or mindset always.

316
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,050
It doesn't just make you more critical
of yourself and make some critical all

317
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:48,410
of the information that you're taking in
of everything that you're reading is

318
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:53,120
everything that you are watching of all
of the constant news and other inputs

319
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:58,121
that you get every day isn't just don't
take it in as candid as you give him and

320
00:15:58,731 --> 00:15:59,061
say,
oh,

321
00:15:59,061 --> 00:15:59,960
that makes sense.

322
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,870
Rather always play devil's advocate.
Say,

323
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:04,340
wait,
that doesn't make sense because we're

324
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:05,480
not in a,
in a large way.

325
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:09,830
That's exactly what Watson does.
And the other good thing to do is get

326
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:14,831
yourself a watson and the sense of get
yourself someone you know with whom you

327
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:17,680
can discuss things,
someone who listens to you.

328
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,210
Um,
it's really good to talk things through.

329
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,470
And I think you often find that when you
see gaps in logic,

330
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,790
when you say something out loud,
that'd be store.

331
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,870
Um,
you never really voiced.

332
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,300
And so one of the ways it can do that
is,

333
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,730
is you think that you know what you're
doing.

334
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,790
Actually pretend that we need to explain
it to someone else and explain it out

335
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:42,680
loud or you can even write it out.
So writing is,

336
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:45,770
it was a good exercise.
Do what you can say he did.

337
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,720
I really understand this because writing
shows gaps in logic very,

338
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,900
very strongly.
So if I write something and I'm like,

339
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,460
wait,
that little bit of sense in my head,

340
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:56,530
but on the page,
it's settling.

341
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,390
Doesn't make sense.
I have to try to figure out why that's

342
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,550
the case and anyone to do that.
Um,

343
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,430
do you don't need anyone else.
You don't want to talk to yourself.

344
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,650
You don't need to imagine conversations,
all you have to do is write out your

345
00:17:09,651 --> 00:17:13,110
argument as if you were explaining it to
someone else or write out their thinking

346
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:15,050
is a few words to someone else.

347
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,090
That's interesting.
Yeah.

348
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:19,730
That's why it can be helpful to keep it
a journal.

349
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:22,810
I know that I've experienced that in
writing a journal that you,

350
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:26,030
you start writing,
you know your thoughts about things and

351
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,880
you're surprised to like,
uh,

352
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,880
your perspective on them is completely
different from what you might have

353
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,850
thought it was in your head.
So,

354
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:38,210
um,
so I have a couple of questions of my

355
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:39,250
own.
Um,

356
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:44,350
and maybe in the interest of time I'll
ask just one of them and then see if it

357
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:47,810
has a follow up.
Um,

358
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,280
and uh,
and we'll,

359
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:49,920
we'll,
we'll,

360
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,790
we'll close out.
I'm looking over here at another

361
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,010
computer.
That's why I'm not looking at everyone.

362
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,160
Um,
many of the points you multitasking.

363
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,553
Yes,
I am.

364
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,800
It's he media multitasking.
Um,

365
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,690
very well.
Um,

366
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,920
many of the points you make in the
workshop add up to the fact that we

367
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,530
can't trust our own common sense.
That,

368
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:12,750
and,
and in your book of course mastermind,

369
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,570
um,
our minds make up stories.

370
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
They're biased to pay attention to some
things and ignore others.

371
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,820
Uh,
and in order to solve problems more

372
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:23,100
effectively,
we need to examine our assumption

373
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,160
assumption's rigorously and consider the
data in ways that don't necessarily come

374
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,140
naturally to us.
Um,

375
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,650
which is very counterintuitive in some
ways to at least,

376
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,690
uh,
the culture I grew up in American

377
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:38,090
culture of,
you know,

378
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,140
trust yourself,
you know,

379
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,960
and trust with sort of your common sense
in a sense.

380
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,070
Um,
not only is this practically hard as

381
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:51,120
we're biased to trust ourselves,
it might also be emotionally hard in

382
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:53,840
that many of us construct our identities
and sense of self worth,

383
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,930
security,
et Cetera,

384
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,890
around self trust,
around trust in our own sort of common

385
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:02,130
sense.
What are your thoughts about how to

386
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,980
manage,
like if somebody is training themselves

387
00:19:04,981 --> 00:19:08,940
to be more skeptical and more critical
of their own thinking,

388
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,960
how to manage that transition
emotionally and otherwise?

389
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:18,350
I think that's a really interesting
question and I think that the way,

390
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:22,530
the way that I view it is it's not,
don't trust yourself.

391
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,760
It's don't trust yourself when you have
no reason to do so when you have no

392
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:30,750
experience in something.
So experts can trust all of their

393
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:34,170
instincts and their common sense in
their areas of expertise.

394
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,620
And the problem comes when non-experts
have a book common sense opinion that

395
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:45,060
really is just coming out of nowhere.
And we do that all the time.

396
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:47,120
There are areas where we're expert,
um,

397
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,000
but then we do the exact same thing in
areas where we're not really experts.

398
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,510
So if you think for instance,
I see this person and he's acting

399
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:57,000
shifted to me,
my common sense as he's doing something

400
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:59,370
wrong,
oh you shouldn't distress that.

401
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,090
That common sense because you're an
expert in looking at people and in

402
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:06,120
reading body language,
you've done that your entire life.

403
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,870
So something as simple as that who
actually aren't an expert in you should

404
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:13,710
listen to yourself even if you're not
really sure why you think something

405
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,130
might be picking up on cues,
the triggers.

406
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,530
Ask Yourself,
why do I think this person's acting

407
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:23,250
suspicious?
Am I actually reading body language or

408
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:28,251
am I using non expertise?
Am I putting someone else in my putting

409
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:33,990
someone else in this situation and this
person just reminds me of someone I

410
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:36,000
don't like.
So now I think they're shifting.

411
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,110
So you have to,
it's not about not trusting yourself per

412
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:43,050
se.
It's about examining the reasons for

413
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:45,510
your assumptions and always saying,
okay,

414
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:50,511
am I actually making this judgment based
on some sort of expertise or am I like

415
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:54,790
one of those people who makes a decision
about whether or not I'm going to hire

416
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:58,340
someone in the first 30 seconds of an
interview just because I liked them or

417
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,710
didn't like them?
Um,

418
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:02,080
in which case there's no expertise
there.

419
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:04,300
You,
you don't know anything about the

420
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:05,300
person.
Um,

421
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,710
so I think it depends on the judgment
and it depends on what you're using to

422
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:10,650
get there,
if that makes sense.

423
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,050
It makes sense.

424
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,470
Okay.
So I think,

425
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,330
yeah,
I'll ask one more question and then

426
00:21:20,331 --> 00:21:21,600
we'll,
and then we'll turn it over to said,

427
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,730
this is about,
uh,

428
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:29,620
the value of creativity and imagination.
How well two psychologists at this point

429
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,030
understand creativity.
I imagine it's not something,

430
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,720
it's not a subject that gets,
you know,

431
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,170
heavy research dollars thrown at it.
Um,

432
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:46,630
uh,
have their insights yet yielded anything

433
00:21:46,881 --> 00:21:49,070
that you would think of as a sort of
practical,

434
00:21:49,071 --> 00:21:53,030
useful approach to teaching or enhancing
people's creativity,

435
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,090
um,
beyond letting your mind do its thing,

436
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,320
you know,
daydreaming,

437
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,283
etc.

438
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,440
Yeah.
I think what we're starting to

439
00:22:00,441 --> 00:22:03,050
understand creativity,
but it's a really,

440
00:22:03,051 --> 00:22:08,051
really hard thing to study because there
are many different types of creativity.

441
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:10,160
There are many manifestations of
creativity.

442
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:14,000
It's not like an overarching entity.
You are or you are not creative.

443
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,530
You're creative in different ways.
And there are different ways of having

444
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:20,350
creative insights.
Um,

445
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,080
so psychologists are a little bit
limited in that they have to study

446
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:27,560
things in a laboratory and so they have
to have an artificial paradigm.

447
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,240
And so they try to figure out,
well,

448
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:32,750
okay,
how can I proximate creativity.

449
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,640
Um,
so that's why you get a lot of these

450
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:39,641
studies that look at the Eureka moment,
the Aha moment where you are able to

451
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:42,020
kind of put things together in a new
way.

452
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,510
That's one way that you can study
creativity.

453
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,540
But it's a V and we're learning a lot
about that.

454
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,630
We're aligning how people can become
better at that.

455
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,460
But once again,
that's a very,

456
00:22:52,461 --> 00:22:57,170
very specific type of creative thinking
and being good at those kinds of Eureka

457
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,860
problems is not the same thing as being
more creative.

458
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,640
Um,
overall what we do know,

459
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,370
um,
that's something that everyone can do is

460
00:23:07,371 --> 00:23:12,371
that for whatever reason,
being in nature helps people become

461
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:15,890
better at problem solving.
So being surrounded by trees,

462
00:23:15,891 --> 00:23:17,160
by water,
um,

463
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:21,230
kind of those types of things for
whatever reason,

464
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:23,750
make people better able to,
um,

465
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,490
to have insights into think of
imaginative solutions.

466
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,640
So it's not just a Eureka moment,
it's also,

467
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,020
you know,
you'll become better eyebrow

468
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,780
brainstorming.
The quality of your brainstorm ideas

469
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,860
becomes deeper.
Um,

470
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,750
and the more that we actually,
the more we learned to pay attention,

471
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:47,050
the more we focus on things.
That's the other part of the puzzle.

472
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:50,030
There's is this,
this focus part of creativity.

473
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,350
People always say that it's,
um,

474
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,490
taking the breaks and those breaks are
incredibly important,

475
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,080
but you have to realize that for homes
and for any other creative person,

476
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,160
there's also a lot of hard work that
comes before and you can't distract

477
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:07,730
yourself while we're doing that.
So homes does have these bouts of

478
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:10,280
intense thinking,
young concentration where he's really

479
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:13,040
mulling over the problem before he takes
his break.

480
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,250
He takes his brake,
he already has a lot of that work to

481
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:18,410
through.
And whenever you hear of,

482
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,440
you know,
people like [inaudible] or anyone else

483
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:26,441
who is often used as an example of
breakthrough creativity and they spent

484
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,870
weeks,
hours,

485
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,630
you know,
years sometimes mulling over problems.

486
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,610
And so then the insight comes in a
second.

487
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,150
But there are different parts to that.
So I think we can train our

488
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:41,450
concentration,
we can take more walks in natural

489
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,260
habitats and those are the things we
definitely know can help.

490
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,910
Um,
it's a field that's,

491
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,910
that's getting more and more attention.
I think people would really love to know

492
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:53,470
how to become more creative.
And the good news is that you can be,

493
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,930
you can become more creative.
And I think that everyone has the

494
00:24:56,931 --> 00:25:00,410
certain degree of creativity in them.
It's not the type of thing,

495
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:01,880
you know,
you can't say,

496
00:25:01,881 --> 00:25:03,320
oh,
I'm not a creative person.

497
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,770
I don't think not creative people exist.
Hmm.

498
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:11,660
Great.
So listen up all you people who like me,

499
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,660
who think of yourselves as creative and
live in big cities,

500
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,260
time to get out into the park.
Um,

501
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,780
and one of the most interesting points I
think,

502
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,850
you know,
Maria that you make in your book,

503
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,650
um,
mastermind and,

504
00:25:24,651 --> 00:25:26,750
and in the big thing,
mentor workshop,

505
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:28,860
how to think like Sherlock Holmes,
um,

506
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,300
is this fact that this is that true?
Like homes is a creative problem solver.

507
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:41,930
That he does take information and
recombine it in imaginative ways.

508
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,500
You know,
we tend to associate creativity falsely,

509
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,570
um,
with the arts.

510
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,300
Uh,
only often and,

511
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,730
and,
and think of science and,

512
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,310
you know,
being a detective as somehow more kind

513
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:56,390
of rational,
linear,

514
00:25:56,391 --> 00:25:58,130
analytical,
not creative.

515
00:25:58,131 --> 00:26:00,740
And I think that's a really,
really important point that you make.

516
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,060
Um,
okay.

517
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:02,894
So,
uh,

518
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,000
with that said,
um,

519
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:07,250
said,
did you have any follow up questions

520
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,350
you'd like to ask before we,
uh,

521
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,900
four we wind this up.
Uh,

522
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,820
oh,
I have a simple one and maybe it just

523
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:15,470
got to be good way close.
I'm kind of curious.

524
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,371
Uh,
Maria,

525
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:20,570
did you ever have,
or what was an Aha moment for you?

526
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:21,970
I've been reading any of the,
uh,

527
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,880
home stories.

528
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,810
What was the Aha moment

529
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,430
or was there a particular Aha moment for
you reading any of the stories where you

530
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,221
just,
you know,

531
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:32,300
we're just kind of hits you and you're
like,

532
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:33,980
oh,
that makes perfect sense.

533
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,530
And the way that he was approaching a
problem?

534
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,680
Well,
I definitely had an Aha moment when I

535
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:44,250
realized that I wanted to write about
homes and started really reading all the

536
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:48,900
stories and I was,
it was more of a reading all of them in

537
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:51,780
very close succession very,
very closely,

538
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:53,340
you know,
underlining,

539
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,310
highlighting,
writing notes in the margins,

540
00:26:56,311 --> 00:26:58,720
kind of doing this very close reading.
Um,

541
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:02,640
and my Aha moment was that Sherlock
Holmes really is a different type of

542
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:04,980
thinker.
The thinker that I remembered from

543
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:08,160
childhood.
And I think that he's often portrayed as

544
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:11,670
being,
because he's so imaginative and creative

545
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,290
and warm and if not a cold machine at
all.

546
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,680
And it was very,
to me it was one of those,

547
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,410
Huh.
Why do people always think of him as

548
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:25,000
this logical Automaton,
uh,

549
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:28,200
as,
as a computer when he's anything,

550
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:29,820
but when all of the things that may
come,

551
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:33,180
Sherlock Holmes are things that a
computer can't accomplish.

552
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,090
And that to me was exactly,
exactly.

553
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,770
It was really eye opening because even
from my childhood,

554
00:27:43,771 --> 00:27:47,070
from reading the stories,
I didn't remember that I instead had

555
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:50,350
that kind of stereotype of peace,
this computer,

556
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,030
just this perfectly logical person.
He's anything about it.

557
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,170
Yeah.
Okay,

558
00:27:57,171 --> 00:27:57,951
great.
Um,

559
00:27:57,951 --> 00:28:02,510

I want to thank everyone out there in
