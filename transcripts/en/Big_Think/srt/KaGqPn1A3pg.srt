1
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,250
First of all,
I wear my seatbelt.

2
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,050
Uh,
it is

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,300
changed my personal habits in a way that
I think are important.

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,770
Uh,
I think it has a

5
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,350
more fundamentally given me a
perspective on life,

6
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,890
uh,
that each moment that we're given is an

7
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:38,970
important one.
Then you want to use those,

8
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:40,080
uh,
moments,

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,880
uh,
as,

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,110
as ably as you can,
whether it's with your family or your

11
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:47,910
friends or,
um,

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,700
in your,
in your working life,

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,600
in all aspects.
Uh,

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,970
uh,
try to,

15
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,350
to seize the moment because those can
come to an end at any point in time.

16
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,080
Um,
life is a,

17
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,260
is a real luxury,
uh,

18
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,010
that one shouldn't take for granted.
So philosophically,

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,260
spiritually,
um,

20
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,060
I think I've grown,
um,

21
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,670
by the experience and,
uh,

22
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,400
I guess the last thing I know is that,
is that,

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,970
um,
I always knew that you had to do things

24
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,290
or things where we're not always of your
own creation.

25
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,950
I'm alive because a lot of good people
help me get a chance to be alive in a

26
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:38,400
certain city in,
in the circumstances that evolved.

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,830
And if they hadn't been there,
um,

28
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,690
I could have been the smartest guy.
I could have been the richest guy.

29
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:48,120
I could have been anything.
It still wouldn't be alive.

30
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,510
Uh,
it's because a lot of other people make

31
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:56,511
things happen that I think all of us
have a chance to be a happy,

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,480
successful,
um,

33
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,483
be who,

34
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:04,160
yeah.
