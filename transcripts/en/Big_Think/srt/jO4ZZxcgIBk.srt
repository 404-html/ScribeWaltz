1
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,740
I would love someone else when they see
it and not only say it's beautiful,

2
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,380
but hopefully to say that
the experience went beyond that.

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,610
I mean,
because beauty in the art world

4
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,460
particularly let's say in the,
in the kind of academic world is,

5
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,440
is a dismissive term,
which,

6
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:39,970
uh,
essentially would mean a decorative.

7
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,390
And I
say to students,

8
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:47,230
I say,
well,

9
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:51,760
I hate to tell you guys,
but you could make it as rigorous as you

10
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:53,920
want.
You can make it as theoretical as you

11
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:54,754
want,

12
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,223
but

13
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,990
don't make it that hermetic.
Let other people in,

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,510
you know,
remember,

15
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,830
who are you talking to?
You just want to talk to yourself.

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,420
You want to talk to a few art
professionals or as Barnett Newman said,

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,760
do you want to hit the ball out of the
field?

18
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,130
I think that's really important.
I think that is a really important part

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,070
of being an artist.
You know,

20
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,380
I always had a sense of
who I was talking to

21
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,150
in my work,
who my audience was.

22
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:34,650
It was always very limited.
It's the voices in our head.

23
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:39,000
We all have voices in our head and
that's what I mean by the kind of,

24
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:41,520
uh,
the weight of consciousness,

25
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,290
who those voices are,
how they change over the years.

26
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:51,291
They change sometimes in my head,
those voices a matter of fact,

27
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:57,510
most of the time,
unfortunately those voices are very

28
00:01:57,511 --> 00:02:02,511
harsh.
They say render really,

29
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,753
um,

30
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,670
very astringent criticism.
Know which any artist will tell you that

31
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:14,600
they're there.
They're their own worst critic.

32
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:18,050
I don't have to read criticism to know
everything that's wrong with my work.

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,140
Does not,
never a critic who said something bad

34
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,380
about my work that I didn't disagree,
that I disagreed with

35
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,970
because I knew when I read it
that I could do it better.

36
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,510
As a matter of fact,
when I've read good things,

37
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,570
it kind of upsets me.
I don't know why.

38
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:44,280
It's just the way I am.
When you're talking to students,

39
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:45,061
you tell them,
you know,

40
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,590
when the end,
you can do whatever you want,

41
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:49,770
but,
but don't let these terms and don't let

42
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,110
the,
the,

43
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,540
the,
the academic part of being an artist,

44
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,920
the kind of graduate mentality,
the graduate school,

45
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,260
uh,
oppress you because that's exactly why

46
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,050
you became an artist.
You know,

47
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,690
it's kind of a peeling back of layers.
It's,

48
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,900
it's hopefully a path to some kind of,
some kind of liberation,

49
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,463
uh,

50
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,110
some kind of map of how you could find
your way out of the,

51
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,070
what I consider the unnecessary
suffering

52
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,670
that goes on in a lot of our minds all
the time.
