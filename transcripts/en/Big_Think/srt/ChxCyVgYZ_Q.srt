1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,490
Everything really kind of depends on the
budget.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,660
If Congress passes adequate
appropriations for the war,

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,710
uh,
for the new fiscal year beginning in

4
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:22,140
October,
regardless of how angry they are,

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,440
regardless of how much verbiage shows up
and the congressional record or in the

6
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:31,110
statute,
uh,

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,140
and Petraeus has given a reasonably free
hand for another year,

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,360
I think the chance of exiting with some
degree of stability might be fairly

9
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:45,570
good.
If that doesn't happen,

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,950
uh,
if the forces in the field are crippled

11
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,370
by appropriations cuts,
um,

12
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,150
um,
that could be very bad from the point of

13
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,620
view of either being able to prevail
over a okayed in Iraq or,

14
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:03,454
uh,
um,

15
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,590
being able to leave any kind of a stable
situation behind.
