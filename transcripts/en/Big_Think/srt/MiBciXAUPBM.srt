1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,240
Okay,

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,540
personally,
today I'm in a very interesting

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,480
stereophonic Ka Ka Ka conversation,
uh,

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:14,630
in,
in,

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,050
in one ear.
Alright,

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,620
I hear beautiful symphonic music.
It,

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,290
it comes from a person like a Gordon
Brown in the UK.

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,540
It comes from a person like,
uh,

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,560
the crown prince of Abu Dhabi who says I
want to build in Abu Dhabi where were,

10
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,570
were,
were today.

11
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:44,070
This the beginnings of an idea capital,
a full idea capital.

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,610
I talked to lead leaders like a Gordon
Brown and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed.

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,350
And I hear from them first of all that
they embraced the notion that the world

14
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:57,510
of the 21st century is going to be a
world of,

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,440
of ideas that that education and
education has the highest level.

16
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,380
It's going to be the key to unlocking
that and,

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,560
and that they see as the future of their
societies investing heavily on the

18
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:17,360
public sphere,
investing heavily in,

19
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,010
in,
in higher education and access to higher

20
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:23,330
education for,
for every talented student and,

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,270
and for system that builds to plus the
students as far up the talent,

22
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,370
talent pyramid as,
as,

23
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:30,330
as they can be pressed.

24
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,300
On the other hand here in the United
States,

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,350
I hear very,
very few of our political leaders

26
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,070
grasping that concept and dedicating
themselves to it.

27
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,180
You hear a person like Mike Bloomberg in
New York who,

28
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:48,300
uh,
it sees the fact that,

29
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,160
that maintaining New York as,
as one of the few idea capitals of the

30
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:57,060
world is key to the city's future and
building the infrastructure

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,990
educationally from kindergarten right
through the leading research

32
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:05,991
universities we have in the city is,
is pivotal to New York maintaining it's

33
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,670
positioned.
But,

34
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:11,700
but what you begin to see dangerously
is,

35
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,970
is most of our political leaders
actually on the other side of the

36
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:19,320
equation.
So in the other ear,

37
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:22,150
in the stereophonic world in which I
live in,

38
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,830
in the other ear,
I hear kind of grading a total music

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,290
coming from the political leadership,
uh,

40
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,840
in,
in the United States where,

41
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,320
where they've begun to demagogue around
issues of higher education.

42
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,660
So you hear a constant connection of,
of,

43
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,503
of,
you know,

44
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,150
healthcare costs and the cost of higher
education.

45
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,030
A very simplistic,
appealing and the talking point message,

46
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,720
especially to the middle class for whom,
uh,

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,380
uh,
the higher education costs are all seem

48
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,770
to be skyrocketing.
And uh,

49
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,940
it,
it,

50
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,670
it's very easy to run past the fact
that,

51
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,670
uh,
at,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,131
at,
at,

53
00:03:05,131 --> 00:03:09,160
at most of the great universities of
this country where tuition,

54
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:10,300
yes,
is going up,

55
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,400
uh,
it,

56
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,010
it,
it's,

57
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,940
it,
it's going up because of the pressure of

58
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,260
providing the kind of quality education
you have to provide the,

59
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,380
it's going up because the cost of books
and technology are going up.

60
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:26,380
It's going up because knowledge is
expanding and it's more to cover and

61
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:28,240
therefore you have to hire more faculty
to do.

62
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:32,290
And it's going up because every single
reform you want to make to provide a

63
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:37,150
better education as students to come to
you involves lowering the student

64
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:39,520
faculty ratio,
which means increasing your personnel

65
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:40,330
costs.

66
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,060
And universities are essentially when
you,

67
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,350
when you boil everything down,
essentially irreducibly,

68
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:50,830
they are socrates and the tree and the
student.

69
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,320
And,
and it's,

70
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:55,540
it's,
it's the problem of the live string

71
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,390
quartet.
You know,

72
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,450
how the personnel intensive a system.
That's what a university is.

73
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:06,180
It's personal intensive faculty.
Students are,

74
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,260
if you,
if you have a live string quartet,

75
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,380
you don't,
you can't use technology,

76
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:14,290
you can't,
you can't take the music because then

77
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:18,640
it's not live.
You can't cut your personnel costs.

78
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:20,530
That is not a quartet,
a,

79
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:23,320
you can't play the music faster because
then it's not really the music.

80
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,680
And that's what we're in,
is engaged in,

81
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,180
in a high class education.
So,

82
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,100
so,
uh,

83
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,430
the politicians in the United States as
they,

84
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,450
as,
as they appealed glibly to the,

85
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,400
you know,
the cost of higher education,

86
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,320
I began to pound that which makes this
country very special.

87
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,530
I mean higher education is the pride of
this country.

88
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:53,650
If they act as if there's some kind of a
monopoly out there among the 6,500

89
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,860
actors in higher education,
diversity as we are,

90
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,410
that is involved in a conspiracy to
build the middleclass of their money.

91
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,000
You know,
this could not be more wrong and it

92
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:13,630
could not be more shortsighted.
So here I am in the stereophonic

93
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:18,631
conversation where outside the United
States people are getting the idea that

94
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:19,560
what,
what,

95
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,780
what you need to have the,
the,

96
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,390
the,
the future to own the future,

97
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:29,170
to be one of the idea capitals in this
matrix world of idea capitals.

98
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,850
You need great higher education.
And here in the United States we're in

99
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:35,150
the process of,
of,

100
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:35,830
of,
of,

101
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,640
of a devaluing that.
So we're in the process of,

102
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,240
in a world where we dominate today,
and I guess this isn't a good metaphor

103
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:49,060
to use given the present state of the
Yankees,

104
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:52,540
but I'll use it anyway speaking more to
the glory of the franchise.

105
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,590
Over time we're in the process of
turning the Yankees into the mud hens.

106
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,490
Well now the rest of the world is saying
we're,

107
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:02,420
we're,
we're,

108
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,750
we're,
we're going to create what you have and

109
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:08,960
if you look 25 and 50 years after,
it's a very dangerous world for the

110
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,070
United States.
How do you change that?

111
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,250
You change it by issuing the clarion
call,

112
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,770
uh,
to,

113
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,450
to,
to the political leadership to begin to

114
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:19,010
take the long view.
Even though,

115
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,100
even though it may not be the
politically effect,

116
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:22,490
the view.
