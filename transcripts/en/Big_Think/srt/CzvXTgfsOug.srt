1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,723
Oh,

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,660
so jocelyn bells,
it's the lady who discovered pulsars

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,360
that they've got the Nobel prize.
And she was here talking to the students

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,950
just a couple of years ago because she's
now a very distinguished scientist.

5
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,190
This,
she discovered pass,

6
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,090
but 40 years ago.
And,

7
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:34,210
and uh,
anyway,

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,220
uh,
students for asking,

9
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:38,260
how are you?
Sorry you didn't get the Nobel prize.

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,371
And she said,
Oh,

11
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:41,020
no,
I've been all my life.

12
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:44,320
I've just been famous for not having no,
but the Nobel prize,

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,740
that was actually much better.
I think she's right.

14
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:51,574
I mean,
you know,

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,340
it's much better if people ask,
why didn't you get the prize?

16
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,490
It's much better than if they're asking,
why did you get it?

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,520
Well,
I would say bringing up six kids and who

18
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:07,360
are all productive citizens and.
