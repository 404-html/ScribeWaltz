1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,850
The autism flat,
and I do think that it is accurate to

2
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:13,851
say that the information technology
industry made other countries,

3
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:20,100
particularly the United States recognize
the changes that had taken place in

4
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:24,930
India and recognize the potential
because of course it was for some time

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,200
the largest,
uh,

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,390
exchange between India and the United
States was in the IT industry.

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,970
And of course this is not only because
we are on opposite sides of the globe.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,473
So,
uh,

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,790
you know,
the day or night factor plays very

10
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,470
nicely for walk in both countries,
but also because a fairly large number

11
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:49,650
of Indian origin Americans in Silicon
Valley,

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,860
we're making their mark.
They were part of the innovative ideas

13
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,770
that were germinating in the silicon
valley.

14
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:03,771
They were part of the way the connection
was made between Bangalore and the

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,910
Silicon Valley.
And so,

16
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:09,240
uh,
I think that maybe the recognition by

17
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:10,110
the,
uh,

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,120
by the,
uh,

19
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,130
United States came as the relationship
in ICT expanded.

20
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,693
Uh,
but,

21
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,100
uh,
I think that there are lots of other

22
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:24,390
areas in which as well we have the
institute for Economic Exchange.
