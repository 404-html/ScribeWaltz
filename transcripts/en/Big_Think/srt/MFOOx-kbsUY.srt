1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,450
What are my feelings about serendipity
versus gumption?

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,870
Uh,
luck versus elbow grease?

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,100
When do you give up on your dream when
you throw in the towel,

4
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:18,800
et Cetera?
Um,

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,430
there's an old quote that I attribute to
Tom Waits,

6
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:24,640
but I believe,
uh,

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,130
it might go back to socrates.
Um,

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,040
luck is when opportunity meets with
preparation.

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,141
And,
uh,

10
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:39,141
I've always found that deeply moving
because Megan and I talk a lot.

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,430
My wife and I talk a lot about how lucky
we are.

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,110
Um,
we're,

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,140
we're both blessed with whatever it is.
She's beautiful and an,

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,470
uh,
an incredible actor and smart as a whip

15
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:58,110
and,
and a really talented singer.

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,790
Um,
I can carry a great deal of luggage and,

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,660
uh,
I can experience extreme temperatures

18
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:11,040
for a long time without any sustenance.
Um,

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,070
we have our gifts and somehow our paths
have taken us to places where people

20
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:20,490
said we were looking for someone who can
carry luggage.

21
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,100
Uh,
we're doing a play about a donkey.

22
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,560
You're the guy.
And,

23
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:28,110
um,
and so,

24
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,560
I mean,
so much serendipity plays into it.

25
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,140
I,
I lived,

26
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,500
uh,
I chose to live like an asshole for some

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,410
years.
And it's a tough choice.

28
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:43,650
It's its borders on irresponsibility.
You know,

29
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:46,980
I,
I would be just this side of broke,

30
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:51,540
so sometimes I'd run out of money and
I'd have to borrow a month's rent from

31
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:55,500
my friend,
but I would then find carpentry work and

32
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:58,830
pay my friend back.
So I was just this side of being a

33
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:02,610
deadbeat.
I was flirting with dead beat ism.

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,480
And it's a big question in Hollywood and
a lot of people make a lot of money off

35
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:11,160
of people's dreams.
You know,

36
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,580
you can pay a great deal of money for
headshots and for acting classes and

37
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:23,331
coaching and life coaching and personal
training and all that stuff.

38
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,250
Um,
and that they'll all tell you.

39
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,180
And,
and there,

40
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,440
there are really gross people who claim
to have the secret,

41
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,250
uh,
come to my acting workshop and I'll have

42
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:38,340
three casting directors.
They're from,

43
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,890
you know,
one of them was an assistant on 50

44
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:43,800
shades of grey matter,
um,

45
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,110
and w whatever the case may be.
It's a question people wrestle with all

46
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,450
the time.
Will I ever make it?

47
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,830
Is it ever going to happen for me?
When should I throw in the towel and

48
00:02:55,831 --> 00:03:00,831
moved back to Cleveland and see my
family and my children and my

49
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:05,110
congregation?
And I'm a priest with kids and

50
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:07,240
Cleveland.
And so,

51
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:11,110
uh,
all I can say is it's,

52
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:12,190
you know,
it's very,

53
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,520
it's a very personal thing to each their
own.

54
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,010
You got to keep working hard.
Um,

55
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,000
we've talked about having a discipline.
If acting is your bag.

56
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,950
Um,
you know,

57
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:28,951
I always tell people if they say,
how can I get my kid to where you are?

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,960
I say take up woodworking but also find
whatever stage,

59
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:39,091
find the biggest stage you can that you
can get onto and perform in front of an

60
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:44,070
audience,
whether you're doing standup or theater

61
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:47,350
or musicals or sketch comedy,
um,

62
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,250
or,
uh,

63
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,950
start shooting stuff.
You know,

64
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:55,630
now we live in an in an age where you
can literally start your own TV channel

65
00:03:55,631 --> 00:04:00,580
right now using your gadgets and a,
and just let the world tell you,

66
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,630
you know,
um,

67
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,920
shoot videos.
Show them to people and they'll tell you

68
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,230
if you should keep doing it.
And if you're good,

69
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:10,540
if something's meant to happen,
when you,

70
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,210
when people see you on stage or they see
your videos,

71
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,800
they'll say,
holy,

72
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:17,420
you know what?
I'm going to somehow help you.

73
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,850
That was amazing.
I didn't,

74
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,200
you can tap dance.
You can play the Tuba that face you

75
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:24,310
make,
whatever it is.

76
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,620
I've never seen anyone drink that much
beer.

77
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:29,110
In 90 seconds I'm going to call my
friend.

78
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:32,560
He has a show called Jackass.
We're going to get you on your way.

79
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,083
And so,
I mean,

80
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,640
I started in the theater.
Uh,

81
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,670
I was terrible at acting.
I wanted to be an actor.

82
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,060
I thought I had something that I could
entertain people.

83
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,240
Um,
so I got into theater school in Illinois

84
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:49,480
and I was terrible.
I couldn't get cast with good reason.

85
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,530
The reason was I didn't trust myself.
Um,

86
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,050
I thought I was boring.
So I was from the country.

87
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,420
And so I tried way too hard to be
someone cooler than myself,

88
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,770
which of course just was,
was what they call bad acting.

89
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,060
But I was able to build scenery.
I was very athletic,

90
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:14,080
so I choreographed fights and the
theater paid me.

91
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,290
I found that there's so many jobs you
can do in the theater.

92
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,140
You can work in the box office,
you can sell concessions,

93
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:22,540
you can sweep,
there are many places,

94
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:26,110
almost anywhere you would want to work
in a creative position.

95
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,240
You can start there sweeping and curate
your sweetening.

96
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,300
Don't,
don't look down on if somebody is like,

97
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:38,560
well you could start as a janitor if you
want to work at Nike and you can get in

98
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:40,420
there as a janitor,
MPR,

99
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,360
show people how creative you're sweeping
is.

100
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,830
Nobody ever moved to that cabinet.
Move that damn cabinet and sweep under

101
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:49,900
it and let someone be like,
Oh yeah,

102
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,950
I just,
I assumed that everyone has the quality

103
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:58,250
of work that I do.
Let people see how committed you are to

104
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,290
two exceptional work when people,
because when you don't do a good job

105
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,060
sweeping,
I noticed that too.

106
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,300
And I say,
I'm not going to trust that person on

107
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:08,810
their own.

108
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,930
They always need to be told to move the
cabinet and sweep under it.

109
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,843
So,
I mean,

110
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,770
if you maintain that sensibility,
it makes you first of all make sweeping

111
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:22,190
a lot more fun.
Sweeping can be drudgery or it's an

112
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:26,540
opportunity to like have fun whistle a
song in your head.

113
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,090
You can dance with a broom.
They're really fun.

114
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,680
Um,
in fact,

115
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:35,681
maybe that's a a video line I should
think about putting out all different

116
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:38,630
genres of music,
all different brooms,

117
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,200
sweeping for pleasure.
Um,

118
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,580
but when you,
once you do that,

119
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:48,581
once you are locked into that mindset,
then you're open to when opportunity

120
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:51,950
comes along,
you've done the work.

121
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,770
You know,
if somebody wants to cast me as a

122
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:58,310
superhero,
this is sort of a truism in my life.

123
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,310
I've,
I've often said I'm athletic,

124
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:06,050
but I have often carried 30 or 40 extra
pounds and I think,

125
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,030
man,
I'd love to play a superhero.

126
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,080
And if someone would cast me,
then I'll go to the gym and get super

127
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:13,820
buff.
Well,

128
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:17,750
if I would just go to the gym and
maintain a discipline there,

129
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,790
then when someone said,
oh,

130
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:23,720
he's funny and he's the right type for
the superhero,

131
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,520
and check out those crazy less that,
then the work is done.

132
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,240
That's what,
sir.

133
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,240
So serendipity involves it.
Serendipity has greatly helped by,

134
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:36,590
uh,
by elbow grease.

135
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,330
And that reminds me of another quote
from Thomas Jefferson.

136
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:44,264
I think

137
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,050
that I won't remember.
Good look.

138
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,650
Okay.

139
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:58,450
Something in the vein of a good luck is
hard to come by,

140
00:07:58,451 --> 00:08:00,250
but,
but when I work hard,

141
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,690
I f I find a much more susceptible to
experience luck.

142
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,950
He didn't say that I said it.
Nick Offerman said that quote.

143
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,470
Put that on a coin.

144
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:18,720
Okay.
