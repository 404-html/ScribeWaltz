1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,920
It's very interesting because I have
worked with both chimpanzees and

2
00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:13,880
dolphins and they're both incredibly
intelligent,

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:19,510
complex beings and it is difficult to
say who is more intelligent.

4
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,800
In fact,
when you get to the level of working

5
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:29,560
with an animal of that complexity,
it's very difficult to,

6
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:34,010
to rank them or to say who is more
intelligent than who,

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,000
uh,
it's easier to read chimpanzees because

8
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:40,880
they look like us.
They're our closest living relatives and

9
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:44,480
their body language and facial
expressions are very much like ours.

10
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:49,010
It's more difficult to read dolphins
because they don't have facial

11
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:51,110
expressions.
They don't look like us.

12
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,251
Um,
so,

13
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:57,251
so there is a difference in how we can
perceive their intelligence.

14
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,430
But I would have to say that having
worked with both,

15
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,970
they are a strikingly a bright.
Both of them.
