1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,590
Yes,
if it was a desert island scenario and I

2
00:00:11,591 --> 00:00:16,591
like to take one font with me,
I guess it would be Helvetica though

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,250
though it has its limitations.
I think it's incredibly versatile and,

4
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,450
and gets the job done.
And I also think it's,

5
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,610
I think it's one of the few typefaces
that will really survive the test of

6
00:00:33,611 --> 00:00:35,080
time,
um,

7
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,280
you know,
beyond the next several decades,

8
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:40,930
if not into the next century.
I think.

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,690
I think there's just something that was
just really done right when that type

10
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:48,110
face was put together and not just that.
I think it,

11
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,540
the,
the conversation that,

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,040
that sort of,
um,

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,900
of,
uh,

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,740
grew around Helvetica,
especially over the past,

15
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:59,020
uh,
five years ago has really solidified as

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,720
a timeless classic.
So that's the one I would take with me.

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,080
Um,
it's,

18
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,560
it's certainly not the only one,
but,

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,270
but if,
if press,

20
00:01:07,271 --> 00:01:08,104
that would be the one.

21
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,510
Well.
Um,

22
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,050
I think,
um,

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,530
you know,
our colleagues over at the Guardian are

24
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:22,430
doing a really great job,
um,

25
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,550
with their news presentation.
And I think,

26
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,670
um,
um,

27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,940
the art director over there,
um,

28
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,350
uh,
who's,

29
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,243
uh,
Mark Porter,

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,810
Mark Porter over at,
at the Guardian,

31
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:37,730
I think he's doing a terrific job with,
uh,

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,800
the news presentation.
He's a guy who came from a print

33
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,290
background.
He was a art director from the newspaper

34
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:48,310
for a long time.
And what I really like about that

35
00:01:48,311 --> 00:01:52,030
example is he was,
you know,

36
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,060
quite modest in coming to the web and
really understood that it required him

37
00:01:57,821 --> 00:02:00,790
to really immerse himself for a year,
if not,

38
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,710
you know,
several years to really get the medium.

39
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,110
And the results are really,
really,

40
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,430
I think,
quite amazing.

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,710
Um,
it's a very,

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,240
um,
very nicely controlled evenly,

43
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,040
um,
sort of,

44
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,690
uh,
sort of executed,

45
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,990
uh,
news experience over there that,

46
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,880
that at the same time really respects
users' needs and goals and responds to

47
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:25,090
them.

48
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,740
And so I think,
I think that's terrific.

49
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,810
You know,
at the same time they have a different

50
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,030
economic situation,
then the times does,

51
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:32,980
which I'm quite jealous of.
They don't,

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,020
they don't have to accommodate the,
the advertising units that we do.

53
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:38,854
So,
um,

54
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,020
so part of that is jealousy.
Um,

55
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:45,280
I also think over it and why mag.com New
York magazine's site,

56
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:46,120
I think,
um,

57
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,010
Ian Adelman,
uh,

58
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,890
the design director there is doing a
really terrific job,

59
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,990
um,
uh,

60
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,820
making,
um,

61
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,430
a site that's not that different from
ours,

62
00:02:57,431 --> 00:02:59,910
but is I think infused,
um,

63
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,990
a lot more,
I think,

64
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:03,430
um,
uh,

65
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,790
sort of playfulness then the times is,
and,

66
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,700
um,
um,

67
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,480
has just done a terrific job over the
past few years.

68
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,000
Um,
uh,

69
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,190
creating,
uh,

70
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,420
a site that's really full of character
and I think really,

71
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:22,110
really accurately translates the,
the personality of the print magazine to

72
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:25,990
the web without being slavish to the
print side.

73
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:31,300
Yeah.
