1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,340
James Martin,
and I'm a Jesuit priest and author of

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:12,341
the Jesuit Guide to almost everything
becoming a jesuit.

3
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:14,810
It's kind of a long process.
Uh,

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,420
you start a as a jesuit novice,
which is two years,

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,610
uh,
in a place called the Novitiate,

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,250
and you do a combination of prayer,
uh,

7
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:25,860
and working with the poor in the middle
of all that,

8
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:26,491
uh,
two years,

9
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:28,980
you'd do a 30 day silent retreat,
um,

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,730
based on what are known as the spiritual
exercises of sending Nicholas Loyola,

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,340
which is kind of an imaginative,
um,

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,880
placing yourself in the gospel scenes
and sort of accompanying Jesus through

13
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:40,710
the Gospel scenes imaginative.
Like,

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,330
uh,
after the Novitiate,

15
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:45,510
you take a what are called your simple
vows of poverty,

16
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:47,930
chastity and obedience.
Um,

17
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,920
after that you do what's called first
studies,

18
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:53,550
which is a combination of a philosophy
and theology.

19
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,950
Um,
and then following that you do three

20
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:58,530
years of full time work,
which is called in the Jesuits,

21
00:00:58,531 --> 00:00:59,580
a regency.

22
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,500
Uh,
most jesuits like to,

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,610
um,
teach.

24
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:04,110
They'll teach in a high school
somewhere.

25
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,520
I worked a overseas at a,
in the Jesuit refugee service helping

26
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:12,990
refugees in east Africa.
Start small businesses for themselves.

27
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,150
So after that three years has done a,
you go to theology studies and a you

28
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:20,670
three or four years of theology studies
and if you're a priest,

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,680
um,
you get ordained at the end.

30
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:26,310
There's Jesuit brothers as well on
people who are jesuits but are not a

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,230
call to the priesthood.
Uh,

32
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:31,980
and then after ordination you work full
time for a couple of years.

33
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:34,620
I'm working in a Catholic magazine and
finally,

34
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,560
uh,
at the end of probably five or six years

35
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:39,810
after that,
you take what are called your final

36
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:42,210
vows.
So the whole process is pretty long.

37
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:45,810
It took me a 21 years to become a
jesuit,

38
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:46,644
which,
uh,

39
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,650
I think it was a little too long for my
taste.

40
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,850
But that's,
that's pretty average.

41
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:52,380
It takes about 20 years to,
uh,

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,610
to become a full fledged jesuit.
Uh,

43
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:55,830
I like to say it's,
um,

44
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,380
it's like being a made man in the mafia
or getting tenure at a university or a

45
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,490
becoming a partner.
You know,

46
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:04,200
you've been in for awhile,
but uh,

47
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,380
but you've,
you're finally finally fully accepted.

48
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:08,940
So it's a pretty long process.

49
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,960
Poverty is one of the three vows that we
take.

50
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:15,580
We take a vow of poverty,
chastity,

51
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:16,750
and obedience.
And,

52
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:17,680
uh,
you know,

53
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:19,780
initially stand Ignatius Loyola,
uh,

54
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:22,030
when he had his conversion experience,
he,

55
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,700
uh,
was injured in a battle,

56
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,340
uh,
and was taken home to recuperate and

57
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:29,800
started to think about doing something
else with his life.

58
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:35,020
He became very aesthetical and gave up
everything and really live like a

59
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,820
hermit.
Lived in a cave,

60
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:39,550
let his fingernails grow long,
his hair grow long.

61
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:43,990
And ultimately he realized that this
wasn't really doing her much good and he

62
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:46,120
needed to moderate some of this.
Um,

63
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,340
he ended up going back to school to
learn.

64
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:49,270
And so he thought,
well,

65
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,720
jesuits should be free of material
possessions,

66
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:54,380
but they don't have to live,
you know,

67
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,890
like they're hermits.
Like they're living in a cave and eating

68
00:02:56,891 --> 00:02:58,150
twigs and things like that.

69
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,100
It's not a,
it's a complete poverty.

70
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,260
So Jesuit poverty is really about
freedom.

71
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,450
It's about the freedom of not owning
things.

72
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,180
It's about the freedom of living simply.
Um,

73
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,180
and it's also about the freedom to not
let anything,

74
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:12,730
any possessions come in between you and
God.

75
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,560
Um,
at the same time,

76
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,750
it's supposed to help us identify with
the poor,

77
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,000
uh,
where we do a lot of work with the poor.

78
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,650
Um,
and uh,

79
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:24,490
we're supposed to try to live as close
as possible to,

80
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,710
um,
what's indignation is calls a,

81
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:28,810
a family of slender means,
you know,

82
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:31,120
people who don't have a lot.
And also,

83
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:33,220
um,
it's supposed to model Christ.

84
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,791
Uh,
I mean,

85
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,160
Jesus,
when he lived on the earth was living

86
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:39,910
very simply as a very simple man.
And so those are the three things.

87
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,840
It frees us up for service that it makes
it makes it so we don't have a lot of

88
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:46,750
possessions to kind of like tie us down.
Uh,

89
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,640
it helps us identify with the poor,
uh,

90
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,050
and it's an imitation of Christ.
It's really trying to follow Christ in

91
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:53,884
more closely.

92
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,720
Yeah.
Chasse that he's the most difficult

93
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:00,940
thing to explain about religious life.
I mean,

94
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:04,600
most people think it's crazy or
unhealthy or a natural,

95
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,220
you don't have to.
The sex abuse crisis,

96
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:09,010
people think that a,
the sex abuse crisis came from jazz city

97
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:10,570
or from celibacy.
Um,

98
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:11,590
but it's really,
as I see it,

99
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:14,140
a different way to love a,
it's certainly not for everybody.

100
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,040
I mean,
clearly,

101
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,500
you know,
most people are called to romantic love

102
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:20,180
and married lives and having children.
Um,

103
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,290
but for some of us,
a,

104
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,050
it works and,
and really what it is,

105
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:26,320
it's a loving many people freely and
deeply.

106
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:29,410
You're not attached to just one person.
You don't have an exclusive

107
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:32,620
relationship.
So you're free to love many people,

108
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,770
which is not to say the people who are
married or are in a romantic

109
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:37,540
relationship,
can't love many people.

110
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:41,080
It's just to say that this is what works
best for people in religious orders.

111
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,540
And I find it very freeing.
Um,

112
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,300
I find people can be freer with me,
uh,

113
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:47,081
in a sense.
You know,

114
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:48,970
when I become close friends with
somebody,

115
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,360
they're not wondering,
is he becoming friends because of sex?

116
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:54,130
You know,
does he have an ulterior motive?

117
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:55,480
Something like that.
Uh,

118
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,760
men and women can feel comfortable with
you.

119
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,701
Uh,
and really a,

120
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:00,160
in a practical level,
uh,

121
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:02,200
it makes you a lot more mobile.
Uh,

122
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,550
you're not in a sense worried about what
your wife or husband,

123
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,440
um,
is going to be thinking about.

124
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,800
You're moving or taking a new job.
So it can be very freeing,

125
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:14,800
but it really freaks people out.
Let me chastity really,

126
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,780
you know,
in a culture that values sex,

127
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:17,710
you know,
and rightly,

128
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,450
uh,
so much.

129
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,940
Uh,
it really disturbs people,

130
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:23,500
but I think,
you know,

131
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,520
uh,
for those,

132
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:26,050
um,
people who are called to it,

133
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:28,330
it can work very well if you live at in
a healthy way,

134
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,140
meaning if you have friends and have
healthy work and healthy prayer life.

135
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,150
Um,
so I'm all for it,

136
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:34,670
but,
uh,

137
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,710
it's not for everybody.

138
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,220
I worked for GE for six years and,
um,

139
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,920
I had studied the Wharton School of
business beforehand,

140
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,450
uh,
before entering Ge.

141
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,740
And,
uh,

142
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,490
after about six years I started to
realize that this really wasn't for me.

143
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,301
Um,
you know,

144
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:55,750
business was a real vocation as it were
for a lot of my friends.

145
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:56,321
And,
uh,

146
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:57,710
I just got more,
more miserable,

147
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:58,670
you know,
the workload got,

148
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,760
um,
more difficult as anyone who works in

149
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,280
the corporate world knows it can be
really stressful.

150
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,510
And I saw some friends of mine really
enjoying the work a while.

151
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:11,270
I just seem to get bored by it.
Um,

152
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,390
at the same time I was getting all these
stomach problems and,

153
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:16,400
uh,
sort of stress related illnesses.

154
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:21,320
One night I came home dead tired after
this long day of work and I sort of

155
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:24,350
plopped down on our couch and turn on
the TV.

156
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,300
And there was this pbs documentary about
a guy named Thomas Merton who was a

157
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:30,920
trappist monk,
a cloistered monk,

158
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,500
and um,
I had never heard of him.

159
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,140
And the documentary really just
captivated me.

160
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,670
Um,
the look on his face,

161
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,050
uh,
just,

162
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:39,960
just,
uh,

163
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,280
spoke this great sense of joy and peace
and calm and consolation.

164
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:47,900
And it really called out to me.
And,

165
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:49,250
uh,
that was so interesting,

166
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:52,580
that one documentary that I went out and
purchased his autobiography,

167
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:53,950
the Seventh Story Mountain,
uh,

168
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,300
which is pretty well known in Catholic
circles.

169
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:58,430
I'd never heard of it.
I devoured it.

170
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:00,650
I read it in a couple of nights and,
um,

171
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,980
I really couldn't get it out of my mind
that that's what I wanted to do.

172
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:05,900
Something like what he did.
I didn't,

173
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:08,390
I wasn't particularly religious.
Um,

174
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,430
I was Catholic,
but I wasn't Super Catholic.

175
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,260
I never thought of anything like that
before.

176
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,640
And I read a lot about Thomas Merton,
and one day I went up to my parish

177
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:18,290
priest and I said,
you know,

178
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,970
I think I'd be interested in being a
priest,

179
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:24,140
which was kind of weird because he had
never even met me before.

180
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,461
And he said,
well,

181
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:28,430
you know,
you should talk to the local diocese.

182
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,290
Um,
and you might want to talk to the

183
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:34,040
jesuits who were up the street at
Fairfield University in Connecticut.

184
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,020
That was the only connection I had to
the jesuits.

185
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,980
So I visited the jesuits at Fairfield.
They gave me some,

186
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:40,730
uh,
you know,

187
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,210
vocational,
uh,

188
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,630
literature,
kind of promotional literature about the

189
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,150
jesuits.
And I read it and I thought,

190
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:48,860
this is crazy.
You know,

191
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,470
actually ripped it up,
threw it away and thought,

192
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,880
this is insane.
You know,

193
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,680
this is not,
this is not who I am,

194
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,211
but,
you know,

195
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:58,400
I read some more and,
and continued to read.

196
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:00,950
Um,
around the same time I started to go to

197
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:04,460
a psychologist because of all these
stress related stomach problems as a

198
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:08,690
result of work.
And so I'm reading and thinking and

199
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,060
going to the psychologist at the same
time.

200
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,280
And finally one day he said to me,
well,

201
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:14,120
you know,
you're in this,

202
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,340
uh,
business world and you don't seem very

203
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:18,800
happy,
so what would you do if you could do

204
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:21,230
anything you wanted to do?
And I thought for a moment,

205
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:21,801
and I said,
oh,

206
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,670
I'd be a Jesuit priest.
And he said,

207
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,161
uh,
well,

208
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:27,290
why don't you?
And I thought,

209
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,080
yeah,
why don't I so,

210
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,520
uh,
it made sense.

211
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:33,170
And I thought,
well,

212
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:35,870
this is really something that I'm
actually interested in.

213
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:38,270
Why am I doing something that I dislike?
You know?

214
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,490
So I called the jesuits and,
um,

215
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,800
they didn't know who I was and I said,
I'm ready to enter.

216
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,783
And,
uh,

217
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,990
they were nice enough to sort of start
me on the application process,

218
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:51,440
which took a couple months,
but a couple of months later I was in,

219
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:53,120
so it was pretty rushed.
Um,

220
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,430
but I just say looking back on it,
it was probably,

221
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:58,380
well,
it was the best decision I've ever made.

222
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,510
Well,
I have to say St Ignatius Loyola,

223
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:08,511
the founder of the Jesuits who lived
from 1491 to 1556,

224
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:09,720
uh,
you know,

225
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:12,420
his spirituality,
which can be summarized as finding God

226
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:13,810
in all things,
um,

227
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,620
or being a contemplative in action.
The person who is,

228
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:21,930
has a sense of awareness in the midst of
a very busy world has really changed the

229
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:23,350
way I live my life.
Um,

230
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,121
I think,
you know,

231
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:26,790
for me,
say in Ignatius's is kind of the model

232
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,260
for all jesuits.
Um,

233
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,580
but I don't just like Jesuit saints.
I also like a saint therese of Lisieux

234
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:37,050
who was a 19th century Carmelite nun who
lived,

235
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:38,790
uh,
what she called her little way,

236
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:42,810
which was basically doing small things
with great love for God.

237
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,070
Um,
I love,

238
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:45,960
uh,
blessed blessing John the 23rd,

239
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,350
um,
who was pope from 1958 to 1963.

240
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,850
Uh,
cause it was so funny.

241
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,010
Basically,
um,

242
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,330
one joke from John,
the 23rd,

243
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:58,830
a journalist asked him once how many
people work in the Vatican and he said

244
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,750
about half of them going know.
So,

245
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:03,000
I mean,
he shows you can be someone with a sense

246
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:04,340
of humor and be a saint.
Uh,

247
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:08,180
and then finally Thomas Merton,
the a fellow whose book I read who Kinda

248
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,810
got him,
he started on religious life.

249
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:12,120
So those are my,
I'd say top four.

250
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,150
You don't need to believe in God to find
his insights useful.

251
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,580
Um,
it helps to understand the totality of

252
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:24,990
his message because a jesuit
spirituality without God or without

253
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,280
Jesus,
you know,

254
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:29,820
we'll only make partial sense.
But that being said,

255
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,770
um,
Saint Ignatius knew that people were on

256
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:33,170
different paths,
uh,

257
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,820
in their life to God and different paths
in general.

258
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,440
And so many of the insights are really
useful to people who are,

259
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,540
um,
not only devout believers,

260
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,870
but even doubtful seekers,
people who are agnostic or atheist

261
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:46,704
stuff.
For example,

262
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,980
he talks about how to make decisions,
um,

263
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,630
living freely,
uh,

264
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,410
how to be a good friend,
um,

265
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,360
how to work well,
uh,

266
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,890
how to be,
uh,

267
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,520
in a healthy relationship with somebody.
So there's a lot of things that you can

268
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:01,980
take from the way of sand,
ignatius,

269
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:04,130
that are applicable to anybody.
Um,

270
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,510
but it really to understand it in its
totality,

271
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:08,730
you have to see it as sort of a path to
God.

272
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:11,160
So I like to say that,
um,

273
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,800
anyone can benefit from the way of
setting niches,

274
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:18,570
but to get to the final and you really
do have to keep your eyes focused on

275
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:19,404
God.

276
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,150
A lot of,
uh,

277
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,350
ignation spirituality talks about
desire.

278
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,140
Um,
and that's sort of a,

279
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,630
a bad word and some spiritual circles
because some people equate it with just

280
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:31,790
selfish wants,
right?

281
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,820
Like,
I want a new car,

282
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:35,100
I want a new iphone,
I want a new pc,

283
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:36,320
something like that.
Um,

284
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,850
or they think of it as sexual desire,
which is,

285
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:39,601
you know,
oh my Gosh,

286
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:41,550
God forbid we should talk about sexual
desire.

287
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:41,951
I mean,
that's,

288
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,020
that's healthy,
right?

289
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,560
But desire on an even deeper level,
um,

290
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,690
is the desire that we have to be who we
are to be our true selves and the desire

291
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:52,790
for God.
Um,

292
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
and there's also desires that,
uh,

293
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,940
lead us to our vocations and what we
want to do in life.

294
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,590
So for example,
um,

295
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,600
uh,
a married couple might discover their

296
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:06,370
vocations through desire.
So the desire for sexual intimacy,

297
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:08,950
for uh,
emotional intimacy,

298
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,750
um,
for a,

299
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:13,930
a sort of connectedness,
I mean that brings them together.

300
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,030
People understand that in terms of
desire,

301
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,750
desire works the same way in terms of
our jobs and our vocations.

302
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:20,860
Um,
uh,

303
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:24,730
someone who was interested in a video
might be interested in it because they

304
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:26,680
feel this attraction to it.
It's really interesting.

305
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:30,250
They feel this desire for it.
Someone who's a doctor might find,

306
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,880
I'm talking about medicine and the body
and things like that,

307
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:35,140
just really attractive.
So,

308
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,640
so desires is really important thing to
pay attention to and ultimately our

309
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:40,530
desires.
Um,

310
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,483
I believe,
um,

311
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,570
our deepest desires are God's desires
for us really and,

312
00:12:45,571 --> 00:12:48,130
and the deepest desires we have to be
our true self,

313
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:51,790
to really live out who we're meant to be
and what we're meant to do are the ways

314
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:56,590
that God has of drawing us to happiness
and also the ways that God has of

315
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:57,371
drawing us,
I think,

316
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:59,680
to fulfill God's desires for the world.
So,

317
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,020
um,
I don't think we should be too hard on

318
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:05,170
desire and the spiritual life or in any
part of life.

319
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,030
Yeah.
I don't think we can find true

320
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:11,310
happiness.
Uh,

321
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,060
you know,
this side of life.

322
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:14,200
I mean,
there's always going to be certain

323
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:16,840
suffering and struggles.
Everybody has problems in their life.

324
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,703
Um,
but I think,

325
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,220
um,
you can attain a great sense of joy and

326
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:24,670
peace if your life is centered on God.
Now that sounds really cheesy,

327
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,410
which does that mean?
It means,

328
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,120
uh,
in the ignition,

329
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,490
a way of looking at things,
the Jesuit way of looking at things,

330
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:34,090
a lot of freedom and detachment from
things that keep you from being

331
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:37,300
connected to God.
It means that being grateful for the

332
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:39,440
things that are blessings in your life,
uh,

333
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,300
it means as a contemplative in action,
being aware of all the blessings you

334
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,910
have in life,
but a certain amount of suffering is

335
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:48,790
inevitable in anyone's life.
I think any religion,

336
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,310
any really healthy religion will tell
you that.

337
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,173
Uh,
so,

338
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,460
you know,
full joy I think is only achieved with

339
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:55,780
God.
Uh,

340
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:56,950
you know,
in the afterlife,

341
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,850
uh,
God willing.

342
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,590
But I think you can experience a lot of
joy in your life today on earth.

343
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,083
Thank God.

344
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,500
Sometimes your own shows where people
are aggressive or confrontational.

345
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:15,010
And it's a important to remember always
to be charitable because,

346
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:15,791
you know,
when I'm talking,

347
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,060
it's not just representing me or talking
about my book.

348
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:21,670
I'm also for better or worse
representing the church.

349
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,900
And so if I come off as being
argumentative or mean or snappish or

350
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:27,160
whatever,
then people will say,

351
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:27,431
well,
look,

352
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:28,450
the Catholic church,
you know,

353
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,710
once again,
you know,

354
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:30,910
they're being,
uh,

355
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,150
whatever.
So charities,

356
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,570
the first thing,
um,

357
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,520
and uh,
you know,

358
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:38,740
I sometimes get nervous about the,
um,

359
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,870
the topics that people choose to bring
up.

360
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:42,220
You never know what they're going to
bring up.

361
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,870
Uh,
but on Kobe or it's a lot of fun.

362
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,733
I mean,
he,

363
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,260
he himself as a Catholic,
so I know that he understands what I'm

364
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,200
talking about.
Uh,

365
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,660
he's funny.
Um,

366
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,250
one of the great challenges of being
that chose just not laughing.

367
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,390
I mean,
he's so outrageous sometimes and so

368
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:59,900
unpredictable that the things he says
just make me laugh.

369
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:01,390
One time I was on and,
um,

370
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,590
we were talking about the recession and,
uh,

371
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,640
how people find God in the midst of
difficult times.

372
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,140
And I said that,
uh,

373
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,080
were sometimes more open to God's,
uh,

374
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:14,510
activity in our lives when we're more
vulnerable,

375
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:16,070
which is true because,
you know,

376
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:19,340
when our defenses are down,
we can let God and more easily,

377
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,440
which is,
which happens when people are sick or

378
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:23,870
when they're going through difficult
times.

379
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,490
Uh,
and he said,

380
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,100
you make God sound like an opportunistic
disease.

381
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,070
And I thought,
I guess I do,

382
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,260
but it was hard not to laugh because it
was so silly.

383
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,191
Um,
but yeah,

384
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:35,750
I really enjoy being on the show.

385
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,610
You know,
on the one hand are people who say that

386
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,860
Anti Catholicism is just as bad as
antisemitism or homophobia or racism.

387
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,440
It's not clearly,
it's not as virulent and not as

388
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:51,320
prevalent on the other end are people
that say it doesn't exist at all.

389
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,221
You know,
but,

390
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:53,860
but it does basically.
Um,

391
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,930
I think a lot of portrayals of nuns and
priests,

392
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,880
uh,
on TV and in the movies or

393
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,560
stereotypical,
um,

394
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,020
you know,
post sex abuse crisis frequently when

395
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:06,710
you see a pre show up on a TV cop show,
you know,

396
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:09,950
he's usually a pedophile.
A nuns are usually portrayed as like

397
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,350
ninnies basically are stupid.
I mean,

398
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,600
I always say,
here are women who kind of built the

399
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:17,750
Catholic healthcare system in the United
States and ran universities and,

400
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,420
but when they come on TV,
they're,

401
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,500
they're portrayed as being idiots
basically.

402
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,380
So there some subtle Antica phalluses
when that,

403
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,700
um,
I think,

404
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:27,110
uh,
you know,

405
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:31,640
you hear people taking pot shots at a
priest for being celibate or being

406
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:34,520
pedophiles are being insane or whatever.

407
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,250
So I think there's a lot of stuff that
slides by,

408
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,840
uh,
you know,

409
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:43,100
on TV and in the movies that would never
be allowed to happen with other groups.

410
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:44,840
You know,
I mean if you portrayed it rabbi or an

411
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,470
email like that,
people would rightfully complained.

412
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:51,290
But in a way,
I think because we live in a largely

413
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,910
Protestant culture,
um,

414
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,730
I think because of the sex abuse crisis,
and I think because of,

415
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:56,750
uh,
you know,

416
00:16:56,751 --> 00:17:01,220
some suspicion about the Vatican and
Catholic theology in a sense anti

417
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,530
Catholicism is more acceptable.
In fact,

418
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:06,140
one person once called it the last
acceptable prejudice.

419
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:08,120
So it's there.
Um,

420
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,590
but I think we need to keep in sort of a
context exactly what that means.

421
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:15,380
It's not,
it's not as virulent as it as some other

422
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:17,390
stereotypes are,
but it is present.

423
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,420
I think it's gotten worse because of the
sex abuse crisis.

424
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,171
Uh,
I mean,

425
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:27,260
I think things are said about priests
and Celibacy,

426
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,220
uh,
which are,

427
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,960
you know,
stereotypes basically.

428
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:33,770
So you take a very small population of
priests who have committed these crimes,

429
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:35,240
then you magnify it and you say,
well,

430
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:37,430
that applies to all.
Praise then and,

431
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:37,731
uh,
you know,

432
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:38,990
I reached out in,
in,

433
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,840
uh,
mainstream newspapers and on tv and you

434
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:44,240
hear jokes and things like that.
And you know,

435
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:45,470
as a priest myself,
you know,

436
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,050
who keeps his valves,
uh,

437
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,980
it's offensive basically.
And I often say to people,

438
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,810
you know,
would you say this about rabbis?

439
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,520
You know,
would you say this about the moms?

440
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:56,670
And the answer is no.
But somehow people think,

441
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,700
um,
because of the sex abuse crisis,

442
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:01,830
it's okay to stereotype all Catholics.
You know,

443
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,030
all Catholics are like this.

444
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,000
All bishops are like this,
all priests are like this and which

445
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,790
would never fly for any other religious
groups.

446
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:12,791
So I just think it's a basically unfair,
I think he's really started to do some

447
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:18,300
really important things.
I think is meeting with the victims,

448
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,240
uh,
during his visit to Deanna to the United

449
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,730
States was a historic and really
unprecedented.

450
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,010
Uh,
I think though that there's always more

451
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:29,850
that can be done for the sex abuse
crisis in 2002,

452
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:31,810
the US bishops met in Dallas,
uh,

453
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,770
to formulate their a zero tolerance
policy,

454
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:36,630
which I think was necessary.
Um,

455
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:37,920
but I think that,
you know,

456
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:41,130
the clerical culture that gave rise to
that a sex abuse crisis,

457
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:42,900
which is essentially,
you know,

458
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,370
a few very sick men,
uh,

459
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,460
who were moved around from parish to
parish,

460
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,271
uh,
you know,

461
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:49,680
by some bishops,
um,

462
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,750
you know,
for fear of quote unquote causing

463
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:54,930
scandal that that's more of a cultural
type thing.

464
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,480
I think that needs to be addressed.
So I think what the church needs to do

465
00:18:57,481 --> 00:19:00,420
is to have a culture of much more
transparency.

466
00:19:00,421 --> 00:19:01,171
Uh,
and frankly,

467
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:03,660
you know,
when these guys do these things,

468
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:05,820
they need to be kicked out.
And then in the United States,

469
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:07,100
that's already happened.
Um,

470
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,720
so I don't think you'll see it in the
United States.

471
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:12,630
You might hear reports of ones that
happened,

472
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,280
you know,
maybe in the sixties and seventies.

473
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:15,300
But,
you know,

474
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:18,000
going ahead,
there is the zero tolerance policy.

475
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,130
Um,
I think other countries are starting to

476
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:21,340
realize that now,
um,

477
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,210
what needs to be done,
it really needs to be just sort of taken

478
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:27,000
out root and branch and blamed on the
right sources.

479
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:30,150
It has nothing to do with celibacy,
has nothing to do with,

480
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:30,930
uh,
you know,

481
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,460
gay clergy,
anything like that.

482
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,890
Neither of those two things lead to
pedophilia.

483
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,330
It has to do,
I think with this culture of secrecy and

484
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,180
the wrong headed notion that we
shouldn't quote unquote cause scandal by

485
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,790
revealing some of these things.
So,

486
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,380
so I hope the Catholic Church really
takes the lead,

487
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,530
um,
in showing other organizations about

488
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:51,120
this because,
you know,

489
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:53,310
I mean most sex abuse takes place in
families,

490
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,010
you know,
their sex abuse in schools or sex abuse

491
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:59,280
in children's organizations like the boy
scouts and the girl scouts.

492
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,850
So I think that the Catholic Church has
an opportunity here to really take the

493
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:07,440
lead and be in the vanguard of
preventing children from being abused.

494
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,730
Glenn Beck's comment really betrayed,
I think a fundamental misunderstanding

495
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:16,320
of the Gospel.
Uh,

496
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,490
uh,
you know,

497
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:22,490
Jesus in the 25th Chapter of the Gospel
of Matthew basically says that the

498
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:26,550
litmus test for how we're going to be
judged at the end of our lives is not

499
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,340
what church we pray in,
how we pray,

500
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,100
even how often we'd go to church.
It's how we treat the poor.

501
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,410
I mean,
it's pretty cut and dried.

502
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,690
You know,
if you want to enter into heaven,

503
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,070
treat the poor.
Well,

504
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,660
um,
now,

505
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,510
uh,
social justice is a way of looking at

506
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:44,310
what keeps people poor.
Uh,

507
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,020
and as the church and its 2000 year
history has reflected on Jesus's

508
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,500
commandment to serve the poor and love
the poor,

509
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,710
it's realized that we need to look at
what keeps them poor.

510
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,480
Uh,
it's not enough to just give someone a

511
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:57,550
handout.
As important as that is,

512
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,250
it's important to,
to look at what keeps the people poor.

513
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,030
So someone told me the other day the
Gospel story of the,

514
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:04,751
um,
uh,

515
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:08,770
the Good Samaritan where the guy sees
someone by the side of the road who has

516
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:12,250
been beaten and he takes care of him.
He brings it back to an end.

517
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:14,890
He dresses his wounds.
He gives him money for the,

518
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:16,060
uh,
for staying overnight.

519
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:17,330
In the end.
Uh,

520
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,650
someone said to me today,
we'd also be looking at why that road is

521
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:22,240
dangerous.
You know,

522
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:24,040
what is it that makes that road
dangerous?

523
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,130
Um,
how can we fix the situations that lead

524
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:29,080
for crime and things like that?
So,

525
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,050
so that's what social justices,
it's basically working for justice

526
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:33,430
society.
Now,

527
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:35,710
how anybody can be against that is
beyond me,

528
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,100
frankly.
He compared to people who support social

529
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:42,490
justice to Stalin and Hitler.
And,

530
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:44,860
uh,
I just found that,

531
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,760
frankly outrageous,
there've been people other than me that

532
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:49,540
have,
uh,

533
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,400
talked about this and he's responded by
saying,

534
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:52,630
well,
I didn't mean this.

535
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,570
I what I meant was this.
I meant that charities,

536
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,630
okay,
as long as it's not,

537
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,341
uh,
you know,

538
00:21:57,341 --> 00:21:59,260
a sponsored by the government.
But,

539
00:21:59,290 --> 00:21:59,951
you know,
once again,

540
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:03,160
how else does the community respond?
Uh,

541
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,140
socially,
other than through governmental

542
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:05,771
policies?
I mean,

543
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:09,220
you can do things individually,
you can do things in church,

544
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:10,600
but I mean,
we have,

545
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,550
we have all sorts of public works,
you know,

546
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:16,210
in terms of social security and Medicare
and Medicaid and,

547
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,010
you know,
even like public transportation.

548
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:19,750
I mean,
that in a sense is providing for the

549
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:21,490
common good.
Um,

550
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,280
so I still think he basically,
um,

551
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:28,000
just doesn't like the idea of helping
the poor.

552
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,520
And,
uh,

553
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,590
I think oftentimes this critique of
social justice is really just a thinly

554
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:35,590
veiled excuse for not wanting to deal
with the poor.

555
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:37,390
And a lot of people find the poor,
uh,

556
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,210
as Pope John Paul said,
irksome intruders,

557
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,400
you know,
into our comfortable life.

558
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,830
But you know,
what good is the gospel if it doesn't

559
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,260
disturb you as supposed to disturb you?

560
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,750
Yeah,
it's very hip to be spiritual but not

561
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:53,830
religious.
Um,

562
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,080
almost everybody I know says their
spiritual now.

563
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:57,130
That's good.
I mean,

564
00:22:57,131 --> 00:22:59,350
spiritual is good.
Spiritual means the,

565
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:02,110
you have a relationship with God.
Spiritual means that you,

566
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:05,020
you connect with God.
That a spirituality is an important part

567
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:06,730
of your life.
That you try to lead a good life.

568
00:23:06,731 --> 00:23:11,380
He try to be in concert with a what your
relationship with God tells you,

569
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:12,600
which is terrific.
I mean you,

570
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,070
you have to have that,
um,

571
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,710
religious on the other hand,
uh,

572
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,350
in current parlance is bad because that
seems to say that,

573
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:21,700
oh,
I believe in this,

574
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,620
uh,
organization that has all these

575
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:27,010
hidebound dogmas and beliefs and I would
never be able to,

576
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,410
um,
belong to an organization that tells me

577
00:23:29,411 --> 00:23:30,730
what to think.
Things like that.

578
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,730
Um,
the problem with being spiritual but not

579
00:23:33,731 --> 00:23:36,820
religious is that you're not part of a
community in a sense.

580
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,040
Um,
and so there's no one to sort of bump up

581
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,470
against to tell you when you might be a
little off track,

582
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,030
um,
as well.

583
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,130
Um,
you're not really able to connect,

584
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,880
uh,
in your spiritual life with other

585
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:50,750
people.
There was a great saying from Isaac

586
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,070
Hecker,
who was the 19th century,

587
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,080
uh,
American priest and he said,

588
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:56,110
religion enables us to,
um,

589
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,420
connect and correct.
So we connect with other people were

590
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:00,890
naturally social animals.
Right?

591
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:03,110
And we like to worship in common.
That makes sense.

592
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,210
We connect with one another,
uh,

593
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:06,740
and were corrected.
Uh,

594
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:07,574
I mean,
uh,

595
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,260
you know,
if I have a direct line to God,

596
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,450
right?
That means that by definition,

597
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,970
anything I think or say is from God.
Right?

598
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:18,770
And that's as we know a problem.
So being spiritual without being

599
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:21,620
religious means that you're lacking kind
of the wisdom of the community,

600
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:23,540
you know,
as well as the support of the community.

601
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,380
You know,
when you're,

602
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,000
when you're sort of struggling,
um,

603
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,030
being religious without being spiritual
is just as bad.

604
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,390
Being religious without being spiritual
just means all you're doing is following

605
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:34,190
the rules.
You're just following the rules.

606
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,760
You're just listening to the community
and yet you're not reflecting on things,

607
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,570
uh,
yourself.

608
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:43,570
So the one thing is what Jesus was
warning against being religious without

609
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:44,810
being spiritual.
You know,

610
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,820
does some of the religious authorities
of his day when I'm warning against,

611
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,450
is being spiritual without being
religious,

612
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:54,020
which is much more common today.
So I think it's not an either or.

613
00:24:54,021 --> 00:24:55,010
I think it's a both end.

614
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:03,240
The worst career advice I've ever had
was when I was at the Wharton School,

615
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,770
uh,
studying business.

616
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,663
And,
um,

617
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,180
I went to my faculty advisor and,
uh,

618
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,430
you know,
a wharton students are supposed to be

619
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:15,300
focused really on the business.
And I said that I would be interested in

620
00:25:15,301 --> 00:25:18,840
taking an American poetry class.
And he said that the stupidest thing

621
00:25:18,841 --> 00:25:20,400
I've ever heard,
he said,

622
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,130
don't take an American poetry class.
It's a waste of time.

623
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:27,630
No one will care if you ever studied
American poetry when you want to get a

624
00:25:27,631 --> 00:25:31,020
job at ge.
So I would strongly advise you not to do

625
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:33,150
that unless you want to be thought,
uh,

626
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,940
you know,
not serious about your job.

627
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,240
So fortunately I didn't take his advice
and it's one of the few courses I

628
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:42,030
remember very well from school.
Um,

629
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,680
the best career advice I've ever gotten
was from that psychologist who said,

630
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,820
uh,
what would you do if you could do

631
00:25:47,821 --> 00:25:48,750
anything you wanted to do?

632
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,050
I think that's a question I ask a lot of
people and it's very clarifying for

633
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:56,760
people because frequently have these
expectations put on us by family,

634
00:25:56,761 --> 00:25:58,500
by friends.
You know what you should do.

635
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,830
A friend of mine called that a shooting
all over yourself.

636
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,410
S h o u.
L.

637
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:04,410
D.
I.

638
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:04,410
N.
G.

639
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,580
Um,
rather than saying,

640
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:06,570
you know,
what are my desires?

641
00:26:06,571 --> 00:26:08,700
What do I like?
What gets me excited?

642
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,590
Um,
and I tend to think that,

643
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,820
um,
you will do better at things that you're

644
00:26:14,821 --> 00:26:17,310
really interested in because you're
going to spend more time with that.

645
00:26:17,311 --> 00:26:20,700
You're going to read about it outside of
work and you'll be enthusiastic about

646
00:26:20,701 --> 00:26:22,410
it.
So when I was at,

647
00:26:22,411 --> 00:26:23,910
uh,
at Ge,

648
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,170
uh,
working in business,

649
00:26:25,171 --> 00:26:27,270
I realized that the people who were
going to do well,

650
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,980
where the people who loved it,
you know,

651
00:26:28,981 --> 00:26:31,020
my friends would read the Wall Street
Journal and say,

652
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:32,130
Oh,
this is fascinating.

653
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,140
And I would say,
how can you read that stuff?

654
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:34,771
You can say it like,
oh,

655
00:26:34,771 --> 00:26:36,510
this is fantastic.
How can you not read it?

656
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,830
And so this notion of,
you know,

657
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,220
following your desires,
I think is really important.

658
00:26:41,221 --> 00:26:41,701
And,
you know,

659
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:44,610
what would you do if you could do
anything you wanted to do is probably

660
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:48,000
the best career advice or the best
question I've ever been asked about my

661
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:48,420
career.
