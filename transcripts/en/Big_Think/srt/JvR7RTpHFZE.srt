1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,970
The work of stellar archaeology really
goes to the heart of the,

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,370
we are star dust.
Um,

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,740
when we are children off the stars
statement,

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,130
you've probably heard it all,
but what does it actually mean?

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,870
We are mostly made all humans and all
life forms that,

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,900
that we know off made mostly of carbon
and bunch of other elements,

7
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:30,740
but in much lesser quantities.
Where does this carbon come from?

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,251
Well,
are,

9
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:34,580
you could say it comes from the earth
and yes,

10
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:38,900
that is true,
but how did it get into the earth?

11
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:42,320
Right?
And so that is where astronomy comes in

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,590
because there are multiple so-called
nucleo synthesis processes that creates,

13
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,630
um,
elements,

14
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:54,080
heavy elements.
They are fused lighter ones into heavier

15
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:57,680
ones,
starting with hydrogen for four hydrogen

16
00:00:57,681 --> 00:01:02,681
atoms come together and fuse into a
helium atom and a few throw helium,

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,960
three helium atoms together.
You get a carbon nucleus and a,

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,270
this is how carbon is created and we
are,

19
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,890
um,
establishing how much carbon was created

20
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,510
at various times in the universe and
through which processes and through

21
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:22,550
which,
and in which types of stars.

22
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:23,541
And,
uh,

23
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,740
in what evolutionaries,
um,

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,430
phases of the stars.
This all happens.

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,060
And so this is how we can piece together
the chemical evolution of the universe

26
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,120
that is really the basis for any
biological evolution to take place on

27
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,960
earth.
And,

28
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:44,720
um,
I find it really exciting to,

29
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:47,030
um,
to go back and really look at the,

30
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,300
at the constituents of life separately.
And we have studied not just carbon but

31
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:57,761
also nitrogen and phosphorous and sulfur
and oxygen and iron and all the

32
00:01:58,581 --> 00:02:00,590
different elements,
um,

33
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,790
through our work and sell archeology.
And actually if you come to think about

34
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,810
it,
the Wa,

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,291
uh,
the,

36
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:06,890
the,
uh,

37
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,890
the body is not just made of carbon but
also a lot of water and there is

38
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,650
hydrogen and oxygen in the water.
And a while we know oxygen also comes

39
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:21,200
from the stars.
You add another helium nucleus to a

40
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:23,510
carbon nucleus and you get an oxygen
nucleus.

41
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,790
But the water,
uh,

42
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,430
the,
the hydrogen protons,

43
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:33,490
they were all formed in the big bang.
So we actually carry about 10% of our

44
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:35,480
body weight,
um,

45
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,180
in,
in us that that is big bang material.

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,860
The protons were all recycle up numerous
times throughout the stars.

47
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,060
Um,
but the actual protons were made in the

48
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:48,410
hot,
Big Bang when all the subatomic

49
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:51,800
particles actually came together and
formed protons and neutrons.

50
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,920
And so that we are,
we are not just children off the stars.

51
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,910
Actually,
we are also children off of the Big Bang

52
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:01,720
and think it's really nice once in a
while too,

53
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:06,190
to reflect on that and,
and really realize how much we are

54
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:08,680
actually connected to the cosmos.
