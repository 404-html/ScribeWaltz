Flow genome project.
What we've discovered when people want

2
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:06,810
more flow in their lives,
the number one thing we can tell them is

3
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:10,410
that there is a flow cycle.
So the old idea about flow was that it

4
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,270
was a binary,
it was like a light switch.

5
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:14,280
You were in the zone or you were out his
own.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,200
What we now know is that flow is a four
part cycle and you have to move through

7
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:23,490
all four parts of these cycle of the
cycle before you can return to the flow

8
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:24,324
state itself,

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,070
the neurobiology,
that flow side.

10
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:39,310
When the actual research came out of her
Benson's work at Harvard,

11
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:42,760
he kind of laid the foundation for it.
But what we've discovered is that the

12
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:45,310
front end of the flow state,
there's a struggle phase.

13
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,010
This is a loading phase.
You are loading then overloading the

14
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:51,640
brain with information for a baseball
player.

15
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:56,320
This is learning to swing a bat and a
ball for a writer planning a new book.

16
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:59,050
This is when you're doing interviews,
this is when you're reading,

17
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:01,300
it's when you're diagramming structure
and things like that.

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,800
It's very unpleasant as a general rule.
So even the flow may be the most

19
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:09,640
desirable and pleasant stayed on earth.
The actual flow cycle itself starts with

20
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,670
a very unpleasant state known as
struggle from struggle.

21
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:15,640
You move into a release.
This literally means you want to take

22
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:17,020
your mind off the problem.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,100
So what happens in flow is we are
trading conscious processing,

24
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,980
which is slow,
has very limited Ram,

25
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:25,420
right?
The working memory can only hold about

26
00:01:25,421 --> 00:01:30,070
four items at once and it's very energy
inefficient for subconscious processing,

27
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,060
which is extremely fast.
It's very energy efficient and has

28
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:37,360
pretty much endless ram.
So to do that you have to move from

29
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:39,820
struggle.
You'll have to let stop thinking about

30
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:41,500
what you were trying to think about.
Basically,

31
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,200
you take your mind off the problem,
you go for long walks.

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,140
Gardening works very well.
Building models works very,

33
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:49,780
very well.
Albert Einstein famously used to row a

34
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:52,420
boat in the middle of Lake Geneva and
stare at the clouds,

35
00:01:52,421 --> 00:01:54,550
right?
Once you can take your mind off the

36
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:56,020
problem and it won't.
By the way,

37
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:59,340
one of the only things that you can't do
to move through release is watched

38
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:01,720
television.
It actually changes your brain waves in

39
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:02,920
a way that will block flow.

40
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,850
But once you move from release,
there's a,

41
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,040
actually underneath the surface neuro,
biologically there's a global release of

42
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,610
nitric oxide,
which is a gas is signaling molecule.

43
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:15,550
It's found everywhere in the body.
This flushes all the stress hormones out

44
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:18,670
of your system and replaces them with
kind of feel good performance.

45
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:23,170
Nancy neurochemicals like dopamine and
Serotonin and endorphins which underpin

46
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:26,800
the flow state as well.
You're in the flow state itself.

47
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:29,800
This is the third stage and the struggle
and on the back end of the flow state

48
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,190
there is actually a recovery phase and
this is really,

49
00:02:33,191 --> 00:02:34,270
really,
really critical.

50
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:38,890
So you go from this amazing high of flow
to a very deep low that shows up in

51
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:41,450
recovery.
A lot of this is that all those feelgood

52
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,300
neurochemicals that drained out of your
system,

53
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:47,200
it takes certain vitamins and minerals
and sunlight and things like that to

54
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,100
rebuild them.

55
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,360
So the recovery phase on the back end of
the flow state is actually very,

56
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:55,930
very unpleasant as well.
And if you really want to hack flow,

57
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,690
you need to learn how to struggle better
and you need how to learn how to

58
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:01,270
recover.
And one of the most important things in

59
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:05,140
recovery is you have to,
you need some emotional fortitude,

60
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:07,420
some grit.
You have to basically hold onto your

61
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,790
emotions,
not get stressed out at the fact that

62
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,150
you no longer feel like superman.
And the main reason,

63
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:17,410
what two reasons for this is one,
if you get too stressed out and feeling

64
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,390
low,
you're going to start producing

65
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:21,010
cortisol.
Little bit is fine.

66
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,940
Too much of it blocks the accelerated
learning that comes with flow.

67
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:27,910
So you will actually,
you'll get the short term benefit of the

68
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:30,840
flow state itself,
but you won't get the longterm benefit,

69
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,530
the accelerated learning that you get in
flow.

70
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,650
The other problem is if you have to move
from recovery back into struggle and

71
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,060
you're bummed out at no longer being in
flow during the recovery phase,

72
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,350
it's very hard to get up for the
difficult place of struggle that

73
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,810
follows.
