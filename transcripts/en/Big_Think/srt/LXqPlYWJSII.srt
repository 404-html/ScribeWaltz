1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,090
What's an event?
It's a difficult question.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,270
Not because we lack definitions,
but because there are too many

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,190
definitions.
In my book,

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,640
I focus on event in the sense of
something extraordinary takes place.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,620
But with all this,
uh,

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,980
a wide span of what we call an event,
I think an elementary structure can be

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,420
described in formal terms within a
certain field of phenomena where things

8
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:40,431
go on the normal flow of things from
time to time something happens,

9
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,610
which as it were retroactively changes
the rules of what is possible in the

10
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:53,541
sense that something happens,
it is generated by that situation.

11
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,280
Of course,
it's causally produced by that situation

12
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,060
back in a way,
it changes retroactively the whole

13
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:06,720
situation.
It's a miracle in the sense of the event

14
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:11,721
would have been an aspect which is
stronger than its own causes.

15
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,340
For example.
Now come a couple of examples that I

16
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:20,400
hope we will all like in literature.

17
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,700
Why is Kafka Franz Kafka the one that we
all know and love and event?

18
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,730
Of course she has predecessors.
We can say that Kafka implicitly or

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,760
explicitly relied on a whole series of
other artists like Edgar Allen Poe,

20
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,370
the story of Ski Visium,
Blake and so on.

21
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,030
But it's not a simple as that because
when you try to isolate in those earlier

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,420
authors what makes them predecessors of
Kafka,

23
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,900
you can see that that dimension Kafka
before Cafca is perceptive and only one

24
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:06,771
staff that is already here as a bar has
the Argentinian writer as he put it in a

25
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:11,250
wonderful,
concise way.

26
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,370
Truly,
Eh,

27
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,920
all authors,
writers have predecessors,

28
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,370
a truly great writer in a way creates
his own past his own predecessors so

29
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:28,440
that uh,
yes there are people who influenced him,

30
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,640
but you can see this influence only once
he is here.

31
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,070
And now let me jump to a totally
different domains.

32
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,040
Love,
love in the good old fashion sense,

33
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:45,750
which is today more and more rare love
as an encounter.

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,320
This is why in English and also in some
other language is not all like French.

35
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,250
You use the term fall,
we fall in love.

36
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,410
This is the eventful dimension in what
sense?

37
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,500
Let's say you live a happy life.
You are lucky.

38
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,890
You have a job,
you meet regularly with French,

39
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,980
you are not in love,
but you just make one night's 10th maybe

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,210
here and there.
You meet every evening with friends you

41
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:14,320
drink,
you go to blah,

42
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:16,750
blah.
Then all of a sudden in a totally

43
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:19,770
contingent way,
let's say you stumbled on the streets,

44
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:24,610
somebody helps you to stand up.
It's a young girl or a boy,

45
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:28,090
blah blah.
And of course it's the love of your

46
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,450
life.
It totally contingent encounter,

47
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,990
but the result can be
that your whole life changes.

48
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,220
Nothing is the same as they say.
You even spontaneously perceive your

49
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:49,261
entire past life is leading towards this
unique moment.

50
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,420
You know,
the illusion of love is,

51
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,290
oh my God,
I was waiting all my life for you.

52
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,210
This something like this would have been
the love event.

53
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,260
And I think it's getting more and more
rare today.

54
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,160
Many intelligent cultural critics.
Notice how we are almost returning to

55
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:17,641
pre romantic premodern times when
marriage or love connections were a

56
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,460
matter of uh,
uh,

57
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,250
relatives,
counselors and so on.

58
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,550
Your uncle,
your own day selected whom you will

59
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:29,620
marry and so on.
Today,

60
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,640
it's similar only instead of all those
old twice uncles and so on,

61
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,670
it's dating agencies,
marriage agencies,

62
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,340
and shown and so on.
What we bought,

63
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:44,341
they offer us is precisely love without
the fall,

64
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,830
without falling in love,
without this totally unpredictable

65
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,370
promatic encounter.
And that's what I find very sad.

66
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,820
I think that today we are simply more
and more afraid of this eventful.

67
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,470
It counters you encounter something
which is totally contingent,

68
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,220
but the result of it,
if you accept it as an event,

69
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,250
is that your entire life changes.
It's a different story.

70
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:20,260
Uh,
this is why I think that this avoiding

71
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:27,151
falling in love is the same phenomenon
as a standard joke that I use in my all

72
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:28,570
my,
uh,

73
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,860
almost all my books.
You know how we want to date the thing

74
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,480
without the bad aspect of it,
without the price,

75
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:39,520
we have to pay for it.
We won't,

76
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,140
I don't know.
Uh,

77
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,640
we want,
uh,

78
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,520
sugar without calories.
So we have sweeteners.

79
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:49,630
We want to be or without alcohol,
we want and so on and so on.

80
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,720
And I claim it's the same thing in
sexuality.

81
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,320
We want brief,
safe sex,

82
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,410
sexual without the fall,
without this fake to attachment.

83
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,370
And I think this is the most set theme
here,

84
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,340
the Tivan what is slowly emerging as
maybe deeper dominant ideology.

85
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:12,760
Today,
what I ironically referred to us,

86
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,760
western Buddhism life is just a playoff
appearances.

87
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:19,570
Don't take it too seriously.
Maintain appropriate.

88
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:22,880
These styles don't get too attached to
where Lee objects.

89
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,830
It's fits perfectly,
this superficial consumerist attitude.

90
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,010
So again,
events are rare.

91
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,580
An event is the traumatic encounters,
which to put it in more learn

92
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,550
philosophical terms retroactively
creates its own costs.
