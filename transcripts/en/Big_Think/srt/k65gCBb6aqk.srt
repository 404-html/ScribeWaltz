1
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:10,570
Which meant it turns out was a very
central part of the constitution of the

2
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:14,570
United States.
Meaning it's obscure.

3
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,550
People don't know about it,
but it probably was necessary for the

4
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:23,060
constitution actually to be ratified by
the American people.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,530
You can see the impeachment clause,
and I'm going to explain its content in

6
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:29,810
a moment,
but you can see it as,

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,800
um,
part of the American revolution itself

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,100
in the sense that the revolt against a
king who was a leader who had authority

9
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:43,940
over we the people was,
um,

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,750
incomplete.
If we didn't have a mechanism by which

11
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:50,960
we could get rid of our leaders,
including the president,

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,310
which was a way of ensuring that we
didn't have anything like a monarchy.

13
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,090
Now,
the way impeachment worked is that in

14
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:03,500
the early American colonies before
America was America,

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,640
we started impeaching,
uh,

16
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,740
people who were following orders from
the king.

17
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,630
And what that meant was that,
uh,

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,640
an abusive authority would be called out
by some legislative assembly.

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,560
And in the initial phase,
what would happen would be there just be

20
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:27,830
a vote that the person had abused
authority.

21
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,100
And then if the thing,
uh,

22
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,500
fell to completion and this goes back to
England,

23
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:37,070
there'd be a trial.
And in the trial the person would be

24
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:41,930
convicted of the offense for which
impeachment was had and if convicted,

25
00:01:41,931 --> 00:01:46,910
the person would be removed from office.
So to bring this back to the American

26
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:50,420
structure as a developed after the
revolution and after the constitution

27
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:53,390
came into place,
and this was thought through with such

28
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:56,660
care in Philadelphia when the
constitution was debated,

29
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:02,050
the idea was that if there is a high
crime and misdemeanor and we can talk a

30
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:06,200
bit about what that means,
or if there's trees in or bribery,

31
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,450
then the house of Representatives by
majority vote can impeach the president,

32
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:14,030
the vice president,
Supreme Court justices,

33
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,100
um,
members of the cabinet.

34
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,970
And what that means is there's a kind of
official,

35
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,570
um,
judgment that the person has done

36
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:25,280
something very,
very bad.

37
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,850
And after that,
the proceeding moves to the Senate,

38
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,680
which is acting like a court and which
decides whether to convict,

39
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:36,050
which means to remove the person from
office.

40
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,530
The house makes the impeachment vote by
a majority vote.

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,260
That doesn't mean anyone has to leave
office.

42
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,800
It then goes to the Senate,
which if it votes by a two thirds

43
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:47,230
majority,
uh,

44
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,710
to convict on the ground on which the
blood say president was impeached,

45
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,830
then the person is,
uh,

46
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,830
as they say about baseballs that are hit
very hard,

47
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,510
the president has gone.
Yes.

48
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:02,380
So,
uh,

49
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,640
because the word high crimes and
misdemeanors seems to mean kind of

50
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:09,310
felonies,
high crimes and misdemeanors.

51
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,430
The normal current reader would think,
oh,

52
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,840
is there a crime?
If you go back to the 18th century,

53
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:21,610
it's actually a lot more inspiring like
that then that and um,

54
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,880
uh,
kind of fitting with a system that's

55
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:26,980
committed to us self government.

56
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,290
So if there's a crime,
let's call it a jaywalking or

57
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,740
shoplifting or not paying your income
taxes,

58
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,220
that's not a high crime or misdemeanor
in the constitutional sense.

59
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,470
What is meant by high crime and
misdemeanor is an abuse of official

60
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:49,471
authority and shoplifting or income tax
evasion.

61
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,230
That's a crime.
It's not an abuse of official authority.

62
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,310
If the president of the United States,
let's suppose a decides,

63
00:03:57,311 --> 00:04:01,420
I'm going to pardon every police officer
who shot an African American,

64
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,400
that's not itself likely to be a crime.
The president has the pardon power,

65
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,640
but that is definitely an impeachable
offense.

66
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,700
In fact,
James Madison spoke of abuse of the

67
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,960
pardon power as an impeachable offense.
If the president of the United States

68
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:21,460
decides I'm going to go on vacation in
Paris for the next six months cause it's

69
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,880
really beautiful.
That's certainly not a crime but it's an

70
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:29,450
impeachable offense.
That's an egregious neglect of uh,

71
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,910
the authority of the office.

72
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,430
So abusive,
the authority of the office,

73
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:36,550
if it's egregious,
pardon power example would be one.

74
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,770
Um,
if the president of starts invading

75
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:43,771
civil liberties in a terrible way by a
locking people up for insufficient

76
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:48,220
reason,
by going crazy in terms of security

77
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:52,570
measures at airports and borders.
And by going crazy,

78
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:56,740
I'm using that as kind of a legal term
of art really exceeding the bounds of

79
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:59,860
the reasonable.
That is not a crime,

80
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,640
but that is an abuse of authority.
And there were right back in,

81
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,650
uh,
the impeachment clause,

82
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,710
which is I think first and foremost way
of preserving our are our rights and

83
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:16,600
liberties and a way of calling out an
authority who has invaded them.

84
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,760
Think now about,
uh,

85
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,860
what the American revolution was fought
for.

86
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,770
And so I've spent a lot of the last
months in the 18th century and uh,

87
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,010
uh,
the people back then,

88
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,270
we're on the impeachment issues and
presidential authority issues.

89
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:39,270
They were off the charts good in the
debate in Virginia on whether we should

90
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:43,810
ratify the constitution.
One really,

91
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,970
um,
learned person said,

92
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,980
we cannot ratify this constitution and
the reason is the pardon power and it

93
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:55,900
was urged by the skeptic.
The president could participate in

94
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,690
something really sinister with one of
his advisors.

95
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,400
Then his advisor is in legal trouble and
then the president can pardon the person

96
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:09,401
for engaging in illegal or corrupt
activity that the president initiated.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,910
How can we allow a constitution that has
that in it?

98
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,870
That's a fair question.
And it was stated with great precision

99
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,950
as an objection to the constitution as I
recall by someone who had actually

100
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,820
signed the declaration of independence.
And I know that person was at the

101
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:29,150
constitutional convention and refuse to
embrace it.

102
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,610
James Madison,
uh,

103
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,630
very quietly responded and he said,
I think the gentleman has overlooked

104
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:40,040
something isn't about a sweet way of,
uh,

105
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,430
responding to someone when the stakes
are super high.

106
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,310
Whether we're going to have a
constitution is the gentleman is

107
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:50,540
overlooked something.
And then Madison explained if the

108
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:55,750
president uses the pardon power to
shelter someone who's done something

109
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,740
terrible,
uh,

110
00:06:57,741 --> 00:07:00,260
there's something available on the
constitution.

111
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,480
Impeachment and Madison actually did his
interlocutor one better.

112
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,230
The interlocutor was saying,
if the president advises something

113
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,630
terrible and participates and then,
uh,

114
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,090
uh,
pardons the person.

115
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,570
Isn't that awful?
Madison said,

116
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,500
yes,
that's awful.

117
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:22,430
And that's impeachable Madison's words
seem to go beyond that to say,

118
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,290
if you pardon someone who's,
who's done something terrible or one of

119
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:31,460
your own people,
that's itself a legitimate grounds for

120
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:35,180
impeachment,
which suggested that abusive the pardon

121
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:40,181
power in the words of James Madison,
that's an impeachable offense.

122
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,220
And with respect to the meaning of the
Constitution,

123
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,640
uh,
it is hazardous to argue with James

124
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,210
Madison.
The beauty of the impeachment mechanism

125
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,460
is its connection with the principle
that we have a republican,

126
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:59,270
not a monarchy,
which means it puts we the people in

127
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,104
charge.

128
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,880
That means that invocation of the
impeachment mechanism,

129
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,150
whether it's a democratic president,
a Republican president,

130
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,480
really depends on we the people.
So if you think of examples,

131
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,640
uh,
there was some interest in under

132
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:20,600
President Bush and President Obama,
some interest in impeaching them.

133
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,030
But I think,
you know,

134
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,660
thank goodness,
uh,

135
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,820
we,
the people,

136
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,250
even if we didn't like either of those
presidents,

137
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,450
didn't think there was an impeachable
offense under President Nixon.

138
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:35,350
By contrast and I believe,
um,

139
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,650
very unfortunately under president
Clinton because he didn't commit an

140
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:41,720
impeachable offense,
but under both of them,

141
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:46,640
there was a public demand for getting
rid of him on the ground that,

142
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,590
uh,
President Nixon had,

143
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,580
uh,
abused his presidential authority to,

144
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,210
uh,
cover up crimes and also had himself use

145
00:08:57,211 --> 00:09:01,830
presidential authority to invade civil
rights and civil liberties,

146
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,840
uh,
that got people,

147
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:08,160
whatever their political affiliation
sufficiently charged up that they

148
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:09,510
either,
uh,

149
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:13,320
we're willing to go along with those
members of the House of Representatives

150
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:16,620
who wanted to impeach Nixon or they
fueled that.

151
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,750
In the Clinton case.
Uh,

152
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:20,880
there was a thought,
and again,

153
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,480
perjury and obstruction of justice,
which were the charges against President

154
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,970
Clinton.
There's nothing good about them.

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,190
They're very bad,
but they weren't,

156
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:31,740
in his case,
impeachable offenses under the

157
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,720
constitution.
Nonetheless,

158
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:36,660
people were charged up.
A lot of people were charged up.

159
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,520
So whether the president is a Democrat
or Republican,

160
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:44,280
whether it's president trump or in the
future,

161
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,143
you know,
some,

162
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,310
uh,
left or center president,

163
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:51,300
if people think that there's something
that really is beyond the Pale,

164
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,680
and that's not the constitutional tasks,
but it's the kind of Colloquia who have

165
00:09:55,681 --> 00:10:00,681
getting at the constitutional task
beyond the Pale of a legitimate uses of,

166
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:03,300
of authority,
then we,

167
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:05,160
the people,
um,

168
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,660
uh,
we're the boss.

169
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,730
So the question,
who's the boss?

170
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,470
Uh,
the first three words of the

171
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:12,240
constitution say it,
we,

172
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:15,510
the people and the impeachment clause
kind of makes that real.
