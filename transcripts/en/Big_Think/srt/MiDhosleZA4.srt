1
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,690
Well,
the advice I'd give and if you were my

2
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:14,000
patient I'd be a little different cause
we'd have a little more time,

3
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:17,420
but if I can distill it down to the
essence of what we do and of course of

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,300
therapy,
the person with panic,

5
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:23,120
I can say this from the inside out,
since you're looking at a panic

6
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:25,700
disordered person in recovery,
uh,

7
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:30,230
has adopted a posture with regard to the
world with the end in which they're on

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,530
anxiety is their enemy and they think
that if they can just get the anxiety to

9
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:38,120
go down,
go away,

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:42,080
not occur as much or not accrual with
such an intensity or at least not occur

11
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:47,030
here or there and that situation,
that then things would be better.

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,090
In fact,
all of that is not the solution to the

13
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,390
problem.
It is the problem holding anxiety is

14
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:55,880
your own enemy and that it has to go
down,

15
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,250
diminish it,
go away and not happen.

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,250
Here is a kind of self invalidating,
interiorly focused process that would

17
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:07,070
get you even more entangled with these
processes.

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,560
Instead,
what we're going to need to learn to do

19
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:14,561
is to allow your history to bring into
the present thoughts and feelings and

20
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:20,210
memories and just sort of hold them
mindfully and compassionately and then

21
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:23,420
focus on what you do and bring them
along for that journey.

22
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,900
So you know,
uh,

23
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:30,410
feelings or only your history being
occasion by the present moment.

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,170
If that's your enemy,
then your history is your enemy.

25
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,860
If sensations or enemy,
your body's your enemy.

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,460
If memories your enemy,
you better have a way of controlling

27
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:44,210
your mind in such a way that you never
are reminded of things that are painful

28
00:01:44,211 --> 00:01:45,110
from the past.
Well,

29
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:48,170
there is no such thing like that.
That's healthy.

30
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,180
And most of the things that people do
that are called psychopathology are the

31
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:57,170
unhealthy things people do when they try
to accomplish that agenda.

32
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,010
If you avoid people,
avoid having your buttons pushed,

33
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,580
avoid going to places that might
occasion anxiety.

34
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:06,470
If you're hammering down drugs and
alcohol.

35
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:09,830
These are all methods of trying to
amount that unhealthy agenda.

36
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:14,831
So I would say,
could we instead take this anxiety to be

37
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:20,030
something that may be of importance?
May even be meaningful.

38
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,690
And it says something about your history
and could we learned to sort of hold it

39
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,630
in a way that's more compassionate,
to sort of bring the frightened part of

40
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:34,631
view close and treat it with some
dignity and keep focused instead of

41
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,920
making that go go away focused instead
on what kind of life you want to live

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,860
connected to,
what kind of meaning and purpose that's

43
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:50,210
going to be quicker,
more self compassionate and more certain

44
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:55,211
journey forward than this kind of out
with anxiety in with the relaxation,

45
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,380
you know,
out with the self doubt in the

46
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:01,700
confidence kind of,
uh,

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,390
let's just snap out of it.
Kind of a harsh and,

48
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,593
and,
uh,

49
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,100
uh,
lack of,

50
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,410
uh,
non-compassionate that place that we

51
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:15,010
stand with ourselves inside.
Things like panic disorder.

52
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,950
Yeah.
