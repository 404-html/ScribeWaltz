1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,990
Yeah,

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,880
well my great inspiration in my life or
sort of two forces,

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,500
one was a religion which is very,
very important,

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,090
particularly for my mother and father,
but also for the members of our family

5
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:26,510
and has been incredibly important in
terms of my life,

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,170
uh,
particularly facing some of the real

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:33,250
challenging times that I've had to face
members of my family that had been lost

8
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:38,720
and other kinds of tragedies.
And also the role of family.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,920
We were a large,
a large family.

10
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:47,921
I was the youngest of nine the last to
come along a sat at the little table on

11
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:53,060
the side of the room.
Always had to battle to get my views

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,360
across or to be able to express it.
But I had a extraordinary role models.

13
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,030
My father who is very,
uh,

14
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,610
uh,
ambitious for his children and it was a

15
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:09,611
great to support her mother who was the
safe haven devoted to her faith and also

16
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:11,480
the love of history.

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,010
Uh,
and uh,

18
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,490
her children.
My older brothers who were a great

19
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,730
heroes of mine and we're inspiring
figures all the way through my life.

20
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,190
Also demonstrated to me that the
political process could work and could

21
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:31,220
be responsive to people's needs and
challenges.

22
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:33,550
My sisters who in their own way,
uh,

23
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,580
we're not elected to any office,
but I'm also were very important in

24
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:43,530
terms of their own commitment,
uh,

25
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:48,020
in expanding opportunity for people.
My sister Eunice Shriver,

26
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:53,021
the founder Special Olympics now and a
144 countries and going to be a world a

27
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,080
focus in,
in China.

28
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:59,370
And just a few weeks from now,
uh,

29
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,480
my sister Jean,
who worked for very special arts

30
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,410
programs,
which has been so important in helping

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,920
people with the disabilities and also
who are artists to work and collaborate

32
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:13,170
together.
And uh,

33
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,650
my other sisters and I was also inspired
by a,

34
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,460
uh,
an oldest sister rosemary who was

35
00:02:19,461 --> 00:02:24,461
mentally retarded and she was a,
a very important figure in our family.

36
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,350
And she was very included.
And I think,

37
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,550
uh,
from the earliest days I recognize the,

38
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,700
uh,
that she was a rather special individual

39
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:37,560
and I could see how my mother and father
had,

40
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:39,470
how my brothers and sisters reacted to
her.

41
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:44,150
And I think it was a,
probably a extraordinary force in my

42
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:45,290
life,
uh,

43
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,010
about,
uh,

44
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,010
recognizing the value and the,
a special grace that individuals have

45
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:56,111
that have a physical or challenges in
this instant mental retardation and the

46
00:02:57,531 --> 00:02:59,300
importance,
uh,

47
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,990
their value and what they could give to
the family.

48
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:04,730
And also the recognition that,
uh,

49
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,590
people,
uh,

50
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,090
out there in our society have a special
needs and,

51
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,980
uh,
they as a,

52
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,190
uh,
as a family and as a,

53
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:19,270
as a country and a society,
we ought to be able to try and reach out

54
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:23,110
to our fellow citizens and to respond to
those kinds of,

55
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:23,801
um,
uh,

56
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:24,670
of human needs.

57
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,553
Oh,
sure.

58
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,401
Yeah,
I,

59
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:31,170
I do,
uh,

60
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,990
I think there are those that,
um,

61
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,281
uh,
in the,

62
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,140
uh,
in the congress elected office,

63
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:39,960
I see them,
I think they are in legislative,

64
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,070
uh,
offices,

65
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:42,750
uh,
as well.

66
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:45,060
I think they're out there.
And in the,

67
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:46,270
uh,
uh,

68
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,311
uh,
in the,

69
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:51,000
in the countryside is not necessarily
always in the house of the Senate.

70
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,560
I think state legislators or we see it,
we see it with district attorneys,

71
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:58,530
we see it in the local communities.
Um,

72
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,330
people,
one of the,

73
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,360
uh,
uh,

74
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,710
events that,
uh,

75
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,170
I'm always inspired of is when a
Caroline Kennedy,

76
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:08,570
my niece,
uh,

77
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,070
gives the a profile in courage award
day,

78
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,151
uh,
each,

79
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,340
uh,
year to an elected official.

80
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,050
And it's,
um,

81
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,610
uh,
we,

82
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,090
I've been on the judging,
uh,

83
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,450
as a judge in there.
And we spend a lot of time in looking

84
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:28,200
over these final recommendations.
And it's inspiring about,

85
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,410
uh,
what,

86
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,250
uh,
how willing people are to stand up and

87
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,360
take a.
