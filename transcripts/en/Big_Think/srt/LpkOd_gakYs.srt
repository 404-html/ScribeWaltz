1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,050
Of course,
a lot of universities are looking for

2
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:17,100
partners in India and a faculty
exchanges,

3
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:21,060
student exchanges.
These are enormously beneficial also to

4
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:22,380
India.
Uh,

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,270
I think the important development that
has happened in America,

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,750
to my mind,
is that all the major universities are

7
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:35,280
setting up India study centers,
or they will have an Indian studies

8
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:40,281
initiative as Howard has a,
Yale has started to offer a major in

9
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:44,790
South Asian studies,
but 90% of South Asian studies is really

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,910
Indian studies.
Berkeley and Stanford have had

11
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:52,200
longstanding collaborations.
A number of business schools are being

12
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:55,620
set up in collaboration with American
institutions.

13
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:57,810
The Indian School of Business in
Hyderabad,

14
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,260
in collaboration with Kellogg has
already,

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,340
after just five years of its founding,
uh,

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,910
become one of the top 20 schools in the
world.

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,540
So that's the kind of

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,760
dynamics,
which is very exciting for us.
