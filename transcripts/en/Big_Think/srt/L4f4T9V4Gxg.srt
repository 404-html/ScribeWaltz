1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,220
Yeah,

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,220
I have no idea.
No particular event comes to my mind or

3
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:22,340
whatever.
It's certainly true that in the post

4
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:26,240
World War Two era when I was.
I was born in 1939,

5
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:29,180
so you can do the math,
excuse me.

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,050
Lots of stuff was happening in,
in,

7
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:34,430
in,
in New York City.

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,940
The United Nations was being built.
Lever House was being built.

9
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:42,740
I remember seeing lever has when it was
nearing completion for the first time

10
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:45,290
because my dentist office was down the
block,

11
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:48,020
so to speak,
things that you could see at the museum

12
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:51,320
of Modern Art,
the various houses that were built in

13
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:53,630
the garden.
I went to all of them with my parents.

14
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:58,631
Took me to the and so let's say
subliminally that interested me.

15
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:04,211
I did have a teacher in a junior high
school and she was the art teacher or an

16
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:09,881
art teacher and her brother was a city
planner and when I expressed my

17
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:13,060
interests,
I suppose he.

18
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,910
She connected me to the brother who was
living in Cleveland as I recall.

19
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:20,030
So it was just the fact that there was
somebody out there might be interested

20
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:22,600
in what I was doing,
making little drawings.
