00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,120
Relations in the United States today.
Marvelously complicated question.

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,120
Um,
there was an article in the Washington

3
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:21,720
Post today about some of Obama's workers
being

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,480
disturbed or more than disturb,
horrified by some of the racial

5
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:31,710
responses they'd had when they go ask
people to vote for Obama.

6
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,200
So race in America is certainly better
than it's ever been.

7
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,190
I don't believe that racism of unsorted
or another is curable.

8
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,430
I think it's always something that's
there for people who need it to use it.

9
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,720
Um,
whether it's racism,

10
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:50,470
antisemitism,
Annika,

11
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:55,471
fallacy ism and a immigration.
There are people for whom that will

12
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:58,590
always give them some kind of
sustenance.

13
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,660
And,
um,

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,010
I think part of the problem is that we
think we can do away with that and we

15
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:07,890
can,
and I think also the part of the problem

16
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:12,270
is that we ask ourselves to cure
ourselves.

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,140
I don't think,
I think that there are still elements of

18
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:19,200
racism and anyone,
anyone,

19
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,040
no matter how much they believe they've
overcome it,

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,270
it's still there.

21
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,410
And to make,
to try to kid yourself and think that

22
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:33,411
it's not is makes it harder.
I think it's important to recognize that

23
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:40,131
human beings tend to think in a,
in a binomial way.

24
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:44,160
We think yes or no.
We think good or bad.

25
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:47,460
We think black or white,
and that's in our minds,

26
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:49,970
that's the structure of our minds and we
can,

27
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:53,370
we have to struggle against it,
but we can't pretend that it's not

28
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:57,660
there.
And I think sometimes we ask people to

29
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,930
get to shed that from themselves to,
to,

30
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,940
to free them from it and people can't.
It's there.

31
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:10,920
It's part of our mental structure and I
think it's very crucial that people

32
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:14,130
recognize no it,
that other people have,

33
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:14,964
that

34
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,250
it's the way our minds are constructed,
our mindset.

35
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,220
It may have to do with something like
computers who the on off through our

36
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:31,630
electrons work the same way in our
brain.

37
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:35,670
They're either clicking on or clicking
off and we tent.

38
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,360
That's the way we work.
We think the first thing we think is a,

39
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,930
uh,
is a yes or no answer,

40
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,140
a two sided answer.
And then we learned that in fact there

41
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:49,200
are many two sided answers in the middle
of those things,

42
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:51,600
that it isn't black or white,
that there are graze.

43
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,450
It isn't good or bad.
There are things in the middle that

44
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,700
temper that,
but as long as we pretend that we can

45
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:03,890
overcome that,
I think it causes us more green.

46
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,060
So long concert,
I thought that question,

47
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,190
how does one identify?
So I think primarily the primary

48
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:25,411
identity is that we're members of the
same species and that that that's

49
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:31,501
absolutely crucial to us that our future
depends on our realization that we're

50
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,010
part of the same species and that
everything else is subservient to that.

51
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,040
As long as we think of ourselves
primarily as American or French or or

52
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,900
whatever Iraqi,
we're going to continue to divide and

53
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:53,570
continued to find conflict.
And I think that the,

54
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,870
the,
the hope is the great,

55
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,200
I've been reading a lot about
globalization,

56
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,260
not just globalization as commerce,
but global globalization as concept of

57
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,280
the way human beings had been
globalizing ever since history began.

58
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:13,480
Before history,
we came out of Africa and spread over

59
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:15,820
the world.
That was the first globalization.

60
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,150
And I think that the,
the,

61
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,210
the kind of globalization we have now
where there's communication,

62
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,780
did intimate communication between
everybody in the world might be what's

63
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:29,880
going to save us from our batteries.

64
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:38,550
Okay.
