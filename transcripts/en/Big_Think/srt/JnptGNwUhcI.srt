1
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,850
Because there is no mystery here and had
worked together at the end for 11 years

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,720
when you had,
starting in the fall of 1956,

3
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,860
we spent three,
four years traveling the country

4
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:27,200
together,
just the two of us to every one of the

5
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:32,201
50 states and you get to know somebody
and then his way of thinking and his way

6
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:38,111
of speaking pretty well when you do it
day after day in all 50 states for three

7
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,980
years or more.
And so the ideas were,

8
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:50,981
his policies were his,
the judgements and decisions were his.

9
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,380
And when a,
uh,

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,710
express those decisions in the White
House,

11
00:00:57,711 --> 00:01:01,790
it was not difficult to,
for me having participated in the

12
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:06,791
meeting to go a few steps down the hall
to my office and try to reflect in words

13
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:13,781
on paper the first draft of the decision
he wanted to convey to the public.

14
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,000
Well,
I'm happy to say that,

15
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,730
uh,
I usually submitted it to the

16
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:21,170
president's chief,
uh,

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,360
uh,
domestic advisor.

18
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,290
That was me and I submitted it to the
presidents of senior policy advisor and

19
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:33,100
senior staff member.
But that also is me.

20
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,650
So being the modest about it,
uh,

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,920
basically I only had to savannah,
to John F Kennedy knowing that the

22
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:48,101
policy expressed in the paper was his
policy and I wanted him to be

23
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:52,430
comfortable with the words and he
changed the,

24
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:56,240
that paper or sometimes a little bit,
sometimes a lot.

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,630
Sometimes he would reject an entire
paragraph.

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,050
If I liked it,
I might find a speech a couple of weeks

27
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:04,970
later,
I would try to sneak it back in.

28
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,640
Sometimes he would recognize what I did.

29
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:14,780
Great.

30
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,920
That sense of satisfaction and pride.
My parents were

31
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,530
two dedicated Americans who brought me
up to try to change the country in the

32
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:30,350
world,
try to make it a better place for all

33
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:33,080
mankind.
I was nobody.

34
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:38,081
I was elected to nothing.
But there I was able to help shape the

35
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:45,431
words and even sometimes the thoughts of
the leader of the free world.

36
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,210
So,
uh,

37
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,360
do have him using the words on which I
had worked a wasn't of course of

38
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,090
satisfaction and pride.
