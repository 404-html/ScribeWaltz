1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,250
Mary poppins,
I can tell you that I have to look back

2
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:15,470
and see how far we've come in all
movements,

3
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:18,950
all social movements,
and every social movement faces this

4
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:21,350
massive uphill battle of being laughed
at,

5
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:22,580
scorned,
rejected,

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,550
uh,
you can look back and just be amazed at

7
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:28,010
the things humans have done to others in
the past.

8
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,630
So that is encouraging.
But I look at the enormity of what's a

9
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,730
hedge.
And that's discouraging,

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,710
but it doesn't really matter,
does it?

11
00:00:36,711 --> 00:00:40,520
Because you'd never know.
You can't get to that crystal ball.

12
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:44,390
You'll never know whether you're going
to succeed or a meteor writer's going to

13
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:46,340
hit the earth and it won't matter
anyway.

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,670
So I feel that I can do is as much as I
can in this finite amount of time I

15
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:54,320
have.
And as you get older,

16
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,650
time goes quicker and you realize how
little you have left,

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,350
not when you're young.
It just doesn't seem to be that,

18
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,230
that way.
So in that small time,

19
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:07,250
I think you can do as much as you
possibly can stink to do in case it's

20
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:10,180
going to make a big difference and have
a big knock on door,

21
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,030
which is your.
