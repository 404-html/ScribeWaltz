1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,030
So I think what's really fascinating is
that there have been a number of recent

2
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:13,170
studies looking at brain structural
differences between liberals and

3
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:18,171
conservatives and what's been found in
several studies is that liberals tend to

4
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:24,651
have a larger anterior cingulate gyrus.
That is an area that is responsible for

5
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:31,341
taking in new information and that
impact of the new information on

6
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:36,651
decision making or choices.
Conservatives tended on the whole to

7
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:41,580
have a larger right Amygdala,
the Amygdala being a deeper brain

8
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:44,050
structure.
That process is more info,

9
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,660
um,
emotional information,

10
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:49,340
specifically fear based information.
So the,

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,500
it's really responsible for the flight
or fright response.

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,360
And this isn't everybody.
It's not black and white.

13
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:59,940
And of course then you know,
what about all of the people in the

14
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:03,270
middle.
But basically the study showed that if

15
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:07,530
you just based it on brain structural
size difference,

16
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,400
you could predict who would be a
conservative and who would be a liberal

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,330
with a frequency of 71 point six
percent,

18
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,810
71 point six percent is a pretty high
ability to predict who is a conservative

19
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:22,560
and who was a liberal.

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,560
Just from brain structure.
When you look at what your parents were

21
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,170
in terms of predicting what you might be
in terms of conservative versus liberal,

22
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,750
that enabled you to predict in studies
at a rate of 69 point five percent,

23
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,580
so very close,
not quite as good.

24
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,990
And why is that interesting?
It's because the brain is plastic.

25
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,360
So the question as to whether you have a
brain structure to start with that

26
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:56,361
informs whether you will be a liberal or
conservative or whether the formation of

27
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,920
certain thoughts from your parents,
for example,

28
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,070
shapes your brain structure because the
brain is plastic and ever changing,

29
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,430
particularly in youth.
So does thinking certain thoughts or

30
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:16,350
predominantly let's say utilizing your
right Amygdala versus your anterior

31
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:18,910
cingulate gyrus inform,
uh,

32
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,930
the growth of those areas and therefore
help you predict later who is liberal

33
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:29,520
and who is conservative.
So in terms of interpreting the meaning

34
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,460
of a different sides,
structures for a liberal versus a

35
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,420
conservative,
I think you have to look at what that

36
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:38,550
area is predominantly responsible for.

37
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,830
So for instance,
for conservatives,

38
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,680
if you're right,
Amygdala is in large and that's the fear

39
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:46,590
processing area.
You would expect,

40
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,950
um,
maybe choices or decisions or character

41
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:54,951
and personality to be more informed by a
response to a fearful situation.

42
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,710
So for example,
conservatives,

43
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:04,711
in fact in personality studies do tend
to rate higher in areas of stability.

44
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,340
Loyalty,
I'm not liking change being more

45
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,980
religiously,
um,

46
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,900
uh,
involved in terms of decision making,

47
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:19,930
having that,
that rate higher for them in making

48
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:22,990
certain choices.
And if you look at liberals from a

49
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:27,550
personality character standpoint,
you're going to find stronger ratings in

50
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:32,551
terms of liking change.
I'm wanting to actually base decision

51
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:38,290
making on new information,
on science information.

52
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,890
And so those differences are not
surprising in light of these brain

53
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:50,021
structural differences.
Being a liberal or being a conservative

54
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,760
really is not a black and white.
It's really a bell shaped curve where

55
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,920
you know,
someone who considers themselves

56
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:59,830
conservative,
maybe far less conservative,

57
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:01,990
so to speak,
than someone else who still calls

58
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:02,980
themselves a conservative.

59
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,980
And that bell shaped curve continues all
the way through where in the middle of

60
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,650
there may be a large group that calls
themselves independence.

61
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:17,200
What we don't know is whether that has
to do with differences in brain

62
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:18,630
structure.
Um,

63
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,390
and so would we see in independence.
No one's done that study to say,

64
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,380
Oh,
independence,

65
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:26,260
don't show any differences in brain
structure,

66
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,050
um,
or any differences and say,

67
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:31,720
um,
risk taking reaction.

68
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,230
So we don't,
we don't know for sure what that means,

69
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,580
but I think it's fair to say that even
when we looked at differences in brain

70
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:43,000
structure with the reliability of 71
point six percent,

71
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,120
that still leaves a very large number
that don't fit into that category.

72
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,810
So,
you know,

73
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:53,830
where do they fall out?
Are they more likely to be independence

74
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,980
in their mind?
We don't know the answer to that.

75
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:58,480
But certainly,
you know,

76
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,730
these are not hard and fast rules.

77
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,760
This is not diagnostic science.
And um,

78
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:10,010
and people who are independent obviously
have certain characteristics I'll say,

79
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:13,900
of both sides are somewhere just like
they sound in the middle.

80
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,270
I think by understanding what's going on
structurally in the brain and

81
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:23,500
functionally in the brain,
we can better understand what informs

82
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:27,190
people's very strong opinions,
um,

83
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,490
that ultimately inform her political
system,

84
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,050
right?
Because it's one person,

85
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,640
one vote,
and in trying to change people's minds,

86
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,120
I think everybody has to look at what's
behind the ability to change your mind,

87
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:46,430
you know,
is it really changeable when,

88
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,250
when we look at,
um,

89
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,190
voting and,
and changing minds and say,

90
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:54,790
political advertising,
you have to recognize that all of that

91
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:58,040
new information always comes in through
the prism of your brain,

92
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:04,030
which means that what I say to you
versus you have maybe heard differently

93
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:10,880
even though I've said the same thing,
so it comes in through the prism of,

94
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:16,390
does what you said make me nervous and
afraid and therefore I'm going to resort

95
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:19,400
to my old standby.

96
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,400
I don't want to change my decision or am
I going to hear the same information and

97
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:25,461
say,
oh,

98
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:28,940
that's novel.
I have a receptivity to novel

99
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:30,620
information.
Therefore,

100
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:34,250
that's interesting to me and I'm going
to think about whether I might change my

101
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:36,350
mind based on that.
New Information,

102
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,190
I think that's what the science is
basically saying to us that there are

103
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:45,191
going to be some people who are going to
hear the information and retreat to

104
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,270
their original thinking and other people
who are going to hear new information

105
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:55,271
and say that really does change my mind
if we're trying to have a society that

106
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,730
will work in its own best interests.
Let's say that we do want to be able to

107
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:06,560
communicate with one another.
And so if you're a liberal and say you

108
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:09,560
want to talk to a conservative about gay
marriage,

109
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:15,070
you want to have in your mind and how it
might still speak to loyalty,

110
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,700
stability and religious belief in some
way that you want to have those ideas in

111
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:26,150
form your communication as opposed to
simply saying,

112
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,690
but you know,
this percentage of the population is

113
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:32,540
homosexual and therefore,
you know,

114
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,990
we should consider whether everybody
should have those same rights.

115
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,790
And you know,
science shows,

116
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,820
it's not a choice.
It's,

117
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,910
it's simply a fact your gay or not gay.
Um,

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,370
and therefore,
shouldn't those people have the same

119
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:49,340
rights?
That's not the best way to appeal.

120
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:54,341
Perhaps to a conservative on this issue,
you want to appeal to them in terms of

121
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:57,020
how,
for example,

122
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:02,021
a marital rules or history might be
maintained and not really altered for

123
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:08,570
those who are in let's say,
a traditional marriage of how it won't

124
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,090
interrupt the fabric for,
for example,

125
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,730
of their lives,
of the rules that they adhere to.

126
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,760
Those kinds of things would be more
appealing to them.

127
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:20,900
Whether or not that might be the most
appealing argument to you as a liberal.

128
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:26,570
The truth is a conservative is more
likely to be able to appeal to a liberal

129
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,780
using novel new information that is
science based and showing certain facts

130
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:38,801
and allowing for it not necessarily to
be purely religiously based,

131
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,690
um,
that not be the rule system.

132
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,730
So to speak,
by being empathically understanding.

133
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:48,860
And by that I don't mean sympathetically
understanding.

134
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:53,720
I mean truly being able to stand in the
other person's shoes and have some

135
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,590
insight into where their brain is
directing them and appealing to that

136
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:00,780
argument.
So if you are conservative,

137
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:05,781
you will want to appeal with new
information because liberals are more

138
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:10,880
novelty seeking potentially.
And um,

139
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,300
and often science-based is a good way to
present new information.

140
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,830
Part of what's difficult,
um,

141
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,060
in terms of what I'm seeing now is that
actually people are tending to double

142
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:28,251
down on their own style and what appeals
to their own group of thinkers and that

143
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:36,381
is increasingly preventing the kind of
communication that would be important to

144
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:42,351
our future so that we can't so to speak
cross the aisle because it would require

145
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:47,130
trying on for size,
the thought pattern of the other group.

146
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,870
It would be saying,
you know,

147
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,280
Oh,
you know,

148
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:51,840
I see,
and that's hard to do.

149
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,330
I literally say that is difficult to do.
So if you're a,

150
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:56,730
migdal is screaming at you,
you know,

151
00:09:56,731 --> 00:10:00,000
run for the hills or you know,
double down and fight.

152
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,910
It's hard to say,
well,

153
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:05,440
let me take a step back,
um,

154
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,550
and not have a fear based reaction,
but instead present the science or

155
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:16,251
present the new information.
A good example would be that of gun

156
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:20,640
ownership.
If I speak about gun ownership to a

157
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:25,200
liberal group,
they automatically have thoughts

158
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:27,990
probably about,
particularly if they are in an urban

159
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:30,210
area,
crime

160
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:37,370
and danger.
Because statistically that is what they

161
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:43,170
have been privy to,
the information has been given to them

162
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:46,350
about how many homicides are committed,
who is,

163
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,390
you know,
dying by gun violence,

164
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:51,840
et Cetera.
If I speak about gun ownership to a

165
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:55,860
conservative group,
they are more likely in their loyal,

166
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:59,880
stable way to think about a
sportsmanship,

167
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,580
hunting with family,
particularly again,

168
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:06,330
if they're in a rural area,
because that is what they grew up with.

169
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:11,390
That is what has been stable for them.
That is the memory that they have about

170
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:16,920
guns.
And so you can see how that's coming

171
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:19,560
from two completely different
directions,

172
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:24,420
perhaps the same word gun,
and that it is hard to stand in the

173
00:11:24,421 --> 00:11:26,130
shoes for,
for example,

174
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:27,600
of the,
of the other group.

175
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,770
Um,
so that you can,

176
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,800
you can come to make decisions about it.
So for example,

177
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:39,110
the CDC has been prevented from doing
any research so that we could have new

178
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,330
science about gun violence as a public
health issue.

179
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,940
Uh,
by actually the conservative political

180
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:53,300
group has said,
you know,

181
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,240
you can't do research on this area.
We won't call it a public health issue.

182
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,280
And therefore,
um,

183
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,530
you're,
you're prevented from getting dollars

184
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:07,120
and prevented from having research into
gun violence per se,

185
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,660
and that comes probably from a fear
position that if there is any new

186
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:18,040
information that sways a opinion,
um,

187
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,520
we will lose our loyal standing to
something that we firmly believe in and,

188
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:28,630
um,
and harks back to very pleasurable,

189
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:33,631
comforting memories from earlier life.
So it's very complicated in a certain

190
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,610
kind of way.
Um,

191
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,790
you know,
the liberal group is wanting there to be

192
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:43,390
this research,
not necessarily to take guns away,

193
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,660
but to say we'd like to see the science
to validate whether or not certain

194
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:53,620
things about guns or good for us or not
good for us.

195
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,100
The most recent study looking at what is
going on in the brain in terms of

196
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,480
politics predicted with the greatest
value,

197
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,890
being able to identify a conservative
versus a liberal 82 point six percent.

198
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:15,020
And this was a look at brain activity,
which is different.

199
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,640
You put someone in a functional Mri
which is different than just taking a

200
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:22,940
picture.
It picks up activity in a certain area

201
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:27,941
of the brain and found that when you
have them do a risky behavior and look

202
00:13:30,691 --> 00:13:35,691
at their activity in their brain,
conservatives were more likely to light

203
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:39,540
up in the fright and flight response
area.

204
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,550
The amygdala and liberals were more
likely to light up in areas that have to

205
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:48,770
do with social awareness.
Again,

206
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:53,771
you could see how therefore this
difference would inform what comes to

207
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:59,141
the mind of either a liberal or
conservative while either involved in a

208
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:05,150
risky behavior or even something that's
happening external to them,

209
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:08,090
but feels like it might impact them in a
risky way.

210
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,340
And that was actually even more
predictive than looking at structure of

211
00:14:13,341 --> 00:14:18,140
the brain or what your parents were in
terms of liberal versus conservative.
