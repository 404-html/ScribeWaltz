1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,740
The question of leadership is really
interesting because,

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,480
uh,
for,

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,370
for,
for most businesses really at this

4
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:17,430
point,
the loss of control they fear is already

5
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:18,810
in the past,
right?

6
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:19,950
That,
that there was,

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,980
there was a media environment in which
almost any message about ibm that was in

8
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:31,311
the public was created by IBM and then
circulated via press release or reported

9
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,550
by a newspaper or what have you.
Uh,

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,660
and then of course there was a,
you know,

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,770
word of mouth chatter on the street
kinds of stuff,

12
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:45,570
but that all operated at a level so much
smaller than anything a large company

13
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:46,890
can produce.
Uh,

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,580
the biggest change in leadership I think
is that those days are over.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,400
And uh,
there's the range of choices leaders

16
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:03,921
have about the perception of their
company a has been quite,

17
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,450
quite restricted,
uh,

18
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,370
because the counter story will always
get at as well.

19
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,050
And it's just,
it's just much more of a dialogue in the

20
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,350
public.
So,

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,700
so the two great visions of,
of leadership we have,

22
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:20,220
right,
the grand visionary or the micromanager,

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,570
uh,
now seem to meet not to work as well.

24
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,520
Uh,
the,

25
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,770
the,
the Internet is kind of compressed,

26
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:33,771
the range and leadership has become
instead a combination of a,

27
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,130
infusing a company with whatever the
core,

28
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,760
the core imperatives are,
and making sure that the company doesn't

29
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:49,530
overbalance too far in one direction or
another.

30
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,560
So Amazon,
to take just one example,

31
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:56,100
Amazon has my favorite corporate award
ever in the history of corporate awards.

32
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,110
They have an award that you can only win
as an employee if you do something great

33
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:03,920
and you didn't ask permission first,
right?

34
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,970
In other words,
you can get if you ask permission,

35
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,790
if you clear things with your bosses,
but if you do something really good and

36
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,250
you just saw that it was a possibility
and you did it,

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,070
you've got a special word for not having
asked permission.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,950
And that's an example of something that
to your friend,

39
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,340
your earlier point about your friend
lowers the amount of internal

40
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:25,341
communication required and also sets a
cultural norm for the business that no

41
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:29,390
amount of memos and mission statements
could Sibley send.

42
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,470
And that kind of leadership.
What,

43
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:32,100
what,
what,

44
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,640
what visa does.
I think in terms of creating a cultural

45
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:40,641
climate where good ideas are rewarded
matters so much more than,

46
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,990
you know,
either grand visioning or a micromanager

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,440
in this,
in this environment.
