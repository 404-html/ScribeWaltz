1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,940
I think I,
I think that philosophy of science is at

2
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:20,721
its best and edits most exciting at
historical moments when it's not so easy

3
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:25,050
to distinguish between,
um,

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,770
the activities of certain kinds of
theoretical physicists and the

5
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:31,260
activities of certain kinds of
philosophers.

6
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,210
Um,
um,

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,280
philosophy of science,
I think,

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,200
or at least.
Well,

9
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:39,030
let me back up a bit.
There.

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,910
There's,
there's philosophy of science can be

11
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:45,570
divided roughly into two different kinds
of activities.

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,890
One is,
um,

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,490
one is an activity of raising and
investigating general philosophical

14
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:58,491
questions about what science is about,
whether the claims of science to have

15
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:05,040
some kind of privileged epistemic access
to the world can be justified.

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,700
Um,
attempts to systematize how science

17
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,750
reasons,
um,

18
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,200
um,
attempts to raise questions about

19
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:15,450
whether we should trust the conclusions
of science.

20
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,640
So on and so forth.
These are very broad,

21
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:21,060
very traditionally philosophical kinds
of issues.

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,610
There's another branch of philosophy of
science,

23
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,320
um,
that,

24
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,310
um,
takes up questions that arise within

25
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:33,630
particular scientific theories,
the theory of evolution,

26
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,610
the theory of relativity,
quantum mechanics and so on and so

27
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:42,720
forth,
and actually gets his hands dirty in the

28
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:46,830
details of the structure of these
scientific theories in order to try to

29
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:51,210
help with problems that are often
essentially scientific problems,

30
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,550
but where,
but,

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,560
but whose solution calls for an unusual
degree of sensitivity to philosophical

32
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,180
questions.
It's the second kind of work that,

33
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,960
that my own work has mostly been in.
It's the second kind of work that one

34
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:10,440
refers to when one refers to the
foundations of physics.

35
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,650
There are problems about the logical
structure of physics,

36
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,430
about the foundational assumptions that
physics makes,

37
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,730
whether these problems properly belong
to physics,

38
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,080
are they properly belong to philosophy
when the field is healthy?

39
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,640
Isn't much of an issue.

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,260
In my own case,
my phd was in theoretical physics.

41
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,380
Um,
I,

42
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,380
I was a professor in physics departments
before being a professor in philosophy

43
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:42,120
departments.
Um,

44
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,440
when I write a paper now,
my rule is that if at the end it has

45
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:49,950
more than two equations in it,
I send it to a physics journal and if it

46
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:51,510
has less than two,
uh,

47
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,560
I send it to a philosophy journal and
there's not much more of a distinction

48
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:59,050
than that when I attend conferences.
Um,

49
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,360
um,
where people are discussing the kinds of

50
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:05,020
questions that I'm interested in,
about half of the people speaking at

51
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:08,830
these conferences are employed in
physics departments and half are

52
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:12,670
employed in philosophy departments.
And it's not particularly easy to tell

53
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,540
by listening to their talks what sort of
department they're employed.

54
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,390
And so philosophy of science,
like I say,

55
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:23,590
when it's healthy,
is a matter of focusing with a certain

56
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:28,591
level of philosophical sensitivity and
sophistication on questions at the

57
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:32,620
foundations of physics.
