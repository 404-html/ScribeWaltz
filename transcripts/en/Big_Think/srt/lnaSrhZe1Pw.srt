1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,490
Take education today,
I used to go to high schools,

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,550
give speeches.
All the times politicians do.

3
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:17,910
I'd look out over that high school group
and we'd had an interaction.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,680
My fractions may not be right here,
but 50 percent of those kids I don't

5
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:25,130
need to worry about.
Uh,

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,650
they come from good homes.
They go to their churches,

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,280
they have good healthcare.
They're involved in their community.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,610
They may not all be a students,
but they're doing well.

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,980
Many of them are a students and we're
not gonna.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,870
Screw those kids up.
They're going to make it and they're

11
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:47,340
going to do well in life.
What bothers me is that other half

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,480
now,
there was a time when we were so good

13
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:53,820
and so strong and so powerful as a
country,

14
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,030
but we didn't really need to worry too
much about that other half.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,160
But that's changing now and we've got to
begin to bring them up.

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,480
And that means the educational system
has to be sharply improved.

17
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,800
So I worry about these things and many,
many others.
