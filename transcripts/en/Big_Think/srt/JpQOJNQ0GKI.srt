1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,800
All
right

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,620
from the age of five onwards.
So it was one of the earliest things I

3
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:21,070
started to read when I started to read.
And,

4
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:23,680
uh,
it was very much part of my

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,700
consciousness in the beginning.
I saw the Bhagavad Gita is a text that

6
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:35,380
was very classical,
most like the Iliad and the Odyssey,

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,920
a mythical saga that showed the eternal
conflict between good and evil.

8
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,640
But much later as I grew up,
I realized that it was much more than

9
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:51,430
that.
It what it was an examination of

10
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:56,431
consciousness and the desire of human
beings or the quest that we have as

11
00:00:57,461 --> 00:01:02,461
human beings to understand ourselves.
That it was the map you might say,

12
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:08,581
for exploring the territory.
And that leads us to find out things

13
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:13,330
about ourselves.
Who are we?

14
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:16,660
Where do we come from?
What's the meaning and purpose of our

15
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,660
existence?
Uh,

16
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,110
do we have a soul?

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,640
What happens to us after we die?
Does God Exist?

18
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,540
Does God in fact care about us?
How can we get in touch with that source

19
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:38,020
that we call consciousness is the
consciousness behind our thoughts.

20
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:43,021
Also the consciousness responsible for
all the intelligent activity of the

21
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:47,560
universe.
The bhagavad Gita is actually a very

22
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:51,310
good text for Yoga,
the Yoga of love,

23
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,340
the Yoga of action or Karma,
the yoga of understanding or intellect

24
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,280
and the yoga of reflection and
meditation.

25
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:05,281
So I think it's a very important a map
for understanding the nature of

26
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:12,280
consciousness.
The word Yoga is the same as the English

27
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:13,480
Word York.
Uh,

28
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,890
so in the New Testament when Jesus
Christ says,

29
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,850
my yoke is easy and my burden is light,
my interpretation is that he's referring

30
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:27,100
to yoga.
It Means Union,

31
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:32,100
Union of the body,
mind and spirit as one continuum of

32
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:36,050
consciousness.
I think the Bhagavad Gita is about,

33
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:39,070
um,
both are the forces of light and the

34
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:43,930
forces of darkness that exists within
our own self,

35
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:48,931
within our own soul,
that our deepest nature is one of

36
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:50,110
ambiguity.

37
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,110
We have evolutionary forces,
their forces of creativity and love and

38
00:02:56,411 --> 00:03:01,090
compassion and understanding.
But we also have darkness inside us.

39
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:05,770
The diabolical forces of separation,
fear and delusion.

40
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,100
And a,
in most of our lives,

41
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,130
there's a battle going on within
ourselves between the sacred and the

42
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:18,790
profane,
between the evolutionary impulses and

43
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:23,791
the destructive tendencies that we have
between creativity on the one hand and

44
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:29,140
addictive behavior.
On the other hand,

45
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:34,141
between the divine and the Diabolico
between the light and the shadow between

46
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:39,781
the sacred and the profane.
So the [inaudible] Gita is a,

47
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,860
an understanding of this battle that we
have in our consciousness that

48
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,750
ultimately is played out in the
battlefield,

49
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,880
as you recall,
our physical bodies in the physical

50
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:55,690
universe.
So by understanding the dynamics of

51
00:03:55,691 --> 00:04:00,190
these forces within our own
consciousness and by beginning to

52
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:05,191
harmonize our impulses with the
evolutionary impulse within us,

53
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,330
we heal ourselves.

54
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,440
And in doing so,
we heal not only our physical bodies but

55
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,220
our world because the world that we find
ourselves in is a projection both of our

56
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:21,520
personal consciousness and our
collective consciousness.

57
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:26,080
So I think it's very relevant to modern
times when you see things like global

58
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:31,081
warming and climate chaos and changing
weather patterns and natural disasters

59
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:36,751
like Hurricane Katrina and extreme
poverty and economic disparities and

60
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:40,900
social injustice and war.
And terrorism.

61
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,410
These are the projection or the
collective consciousness that's in

62
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:51,691
disarray of a collective consciousness
where there is a rift in the collective

63
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,260
soul,
a collective consciousness that,

64
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:58,480
uh,
is evolving.

65
00:04:58,481 --> 00:04:59,310
But,
um,

66
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,250
he was going through a lunch.

67
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,310
Okay.
