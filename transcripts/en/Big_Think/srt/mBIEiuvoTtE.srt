1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,940
I
wanted to write about what it means that

2
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:10,170
some people see me,
they have to earn or have to do

3
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:13,590
something to deserve access to.
Things that we think about is basic

4
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:16,650
necessity.
So how hard can you work to earn access

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:20,940
to a meal every night or like earn or
what do you have to do to deserve a good

6
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:23,820
education?
What do you have to do to deserve to

7
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:27,570
have housing and that's one of the ways
that race sort of works in this country

8
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:30,030
is that there's some people that are
deemed inherently worthy.

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,450
So we think about the way whiteness and
white supremacy people are just deemed

10
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:35,040
white people are just deemed worthy of
things,

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,950
but there's this notion that you need to
work extra hard to deserve a great

12
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:40,740
public education.
I am from Baltimore and we think about

13
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:44,340
the school system in Baltimore City is
not funded equitably at all and it's

14
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:44,551
like,
well,

15
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:48,000
what do those kids have to do to like
earn equitable funding?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,420
They actually don't need to do anything
besides just be alive and one of the

17
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:54,450
things that we need to do is make sure
that we set up a system where people

18
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:56,790
just have the basic necessities like
food,

19
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:57,750
water,
education.

20
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:01,170
We can guarantee that there's no reason
why we don't have it here.

21
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:03,200
So I actually think about the diversity
and equality and equity,

22
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,190
right?
The equality is everybody gets the same

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,810
thing.
Equity is that people get what they need

24
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:08,580
and deserve.
And then the worker justice,

25
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,410
we are almost always fighting for
equity.

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,510
So we think about things like school
funding.

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,380
We are not asking for equal funding.
We know that it just costs more to

28
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:19,680
educate kids who grew up in poverty.
It costs more to educate kids with

29
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,680
special needs and we know that we need
to pay that cost,

30
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:25,920
that those kids deserve.
That we're not saying that every kid,

31
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,900
uh,
it costs the same to educate every kid.

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,090
That's just not true.
We want a world of equity where people

33
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:33,180
get what they need and deserve.
We know the disparities around criminal

34
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:35,670
justice,
that there are disparities around race

35
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:39,090
and we want an equitable system that
doesn't penalize people for where they

36
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:40,830
live,
how they show up,

37
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:43,620
what zip code they come from.
So the difference between equity and

38
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:47,260
equality as an important distinction and
the only way to get to equality equality

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,680
and access,
how whatever metric of equality you want

40
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,350
is by having equity of resources,
right?

41
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,650
Equity of experiences.
I did the equity pieces that you need

42
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:57,990
something different and you deserve
something different.

43
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,870
And from a system level I'm going to
make sure that you have access to that.

44
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,190
So I was talking to somebody about about
who's named Swanson a and she was like,

45
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:09,340
people should have to work for food
stamps because if they work for it

46
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,810
though dignity and I'm like,
you know,

47
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,330
not eating.

48
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,450
I think it's pretty addictive.
Like not having food is a lack of

49
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:16,740
dignity right there,
right?

50
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:19,290
That like food is one of those basic
things.

51
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,270
We have enough food that we can beat
everybody.

52
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:23,430
We have enough water to everybody can,
you know,

53
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,730
have a,
a meal at three meals every single day.

54
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:30,240
Like we can guarantee those things.
We don't need to artificially create

55
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:34,020
this requirement that people like work
so they can earn food,

56
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,630
like we can actually guarantee these
basic things for people,

57
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,080
uh,
in one of the things that we have to do

58
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,770
as we fight for social justice,
as talk about these things as basic as

59
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:44,710
they are,
the,

60
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:47,340
it's not radical to believe that we can
live in a world with the police.

61
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:49,950
Don't kill people.
It's not radical to say that every kid

62
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:53,340
should be able to read and write.
It's not radical or extreme to say that

63
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,740
we can feed every single person every
single day.

64
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,750
That the only radical thing about it is
that we have to say in the first place

65
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:00,400
like,
that is actually where the radical part

66
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,900
comes in.
And we,

67
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:05,950
I think about that because polarization
thrives in a world of extremes.

68
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,860
And so often people want to paint our
positions is extreme.

69
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:12,850
It's an extreme position to say that
there should be equity advantage.

70
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:15,880
That's not extreme.
The extreme thing about it is that we

71
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:17,680
don't have it right now and that we have
defined for it.

72
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,790
I was in a meeting once and we were
talking about welfare and it was people

73
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,840
from the right and the left and one of
her sort of,

74
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,420
there was a person in it who was sort of
against welfare and her push was like,

75
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,780
you know,
people need to,

76
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,230
people need to like earn it.
People need to work hard for it and if

77
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,480
they work hard for it they'll feel
better and it's like A.

78
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,670
I don't know.
I think that people like have already

79
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:42,520
worked hard to like get a meal.
I think that people being alive,

80
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:45,460
it's like enough of that and there's
some people who feel like they just

81
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,050
deserve everything.
They're like.

82
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:49,930
One of the ways that white supremacy
works is that people really do feel like

83
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,060
they've already earned.
They put in the hard work,

84
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,550
they've done something or the,
all the,

85
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,280
all the things that they get are
actually the benefits of their hard

86
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:58,690
work.
You think about the way wealth works in

87
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:01,540
this country is that in 2023,
the median wealth for black people's

88
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,160
gonna be $0.
The lowest recorded.

89
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,110
It's since you've been recording about
them this way and you didn't go to the

90
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:08,860
median wealth of $0 and you think about
white wealth,

91
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:12,630
which is will be around $100,000 in the
medium.

92
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,020
Black walls will be zero.

93
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,970
Is that.
It sounds like why people like worked

94
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:17,320
hard for that.
It's not like white people,

95
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:20,440
like every white person was like some
entrepreneur that like did all these

96
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:23,350
wealth building things.
The government literally gave white

97
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:23,980
people.
Well,

98
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,670
the government gave white people housing
loans for very little with very little

99
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:30,760
interest in government gave white people
land.

100
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,870
The highway administration created the
suburbs and you think about what it

101
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:38,700
means that the government gave people a.
gave white people like education in

102
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:41,950
mass,
like those things contributed to white

103
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:42,480
wealth,
but there are.

104
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,260
People were like,
I worked really hard and say,

105
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,800
how hard did you work for a system that
just like benefits your skin colored

106
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,550
every turn of the way you didn't do
that,

107
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:53,410
you know?
How hard did you work for every band aid

108
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:56,230
to look like you?
How hard did you work for nude to be the

109
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:57,550
color of your skin and not mine?

110
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,090
Like you didn't do that.
A system did that and like that.

111
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:03,940
You benefit from the system and part of
the work of white people is to

112
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:07,930
understand the privilege of whiteness
and to understand how a system provided

113
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:11,050
that and work to dismantle it and
actually is dangerous a teacher.

114
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:14,500
So there's a study that came out that
was the first time measures,

115
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,760
how meritocracy impacts middle schoolers
and it's like a seventh grade in seventh

116
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:23,761
grade kids and it shows that kids
actually kids of color do worse later if

117
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:28,660
they believe that meritocracy is like a
real thing because the systems are to

118
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,240
bear down on them in hallways.
They think that it's a result of like

119
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,530
dumb,
just not working hard,

120
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,581
and it's like,
no,

121
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:37,510
we know that the way systemic racism
shows up later like means that no matter

122
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,760
how gifted you are,
how great you are,

123
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,440
the outcome still just aren't the same.
We know what the criminal justice here

124
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,030
you think about New York City,
that 90 percent of the people arrested

125
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:50,050
for marijuana are black and brown.
You and I both know that the 90 percent

126
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:53,290
of the people in New York City smoking
weed or not black or brown.

127
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,720
When we think about the arrests,
we think about disparities in education.

128
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,740
The meritocracy causes people to blame
themselves for outcomes and not

129
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:03,980
realizing that the system is almost
guaranteeing instead of outcomes.
