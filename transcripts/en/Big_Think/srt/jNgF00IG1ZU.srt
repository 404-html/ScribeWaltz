1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,110
Well in many of the animal groups that
we're looking at,

2
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,580
you,
I mentioned aunts and that was sort of

3
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:16,550
special genetics of closeness,
so we can exclude them for now.

4
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:19,210
But even when we look at selfish
organisms like the fixed,

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,270
you know,
they're all locusts,

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,490
they've evolved to lift with an
incredibly large troops and incredibly

7
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:27,790
large societies.
Now we humans happened,

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,960
you know,
with food into these large cities.

9
00:00:29,961 --> 00:00:31,940
No,
but that's not actually how we evolved.

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,770
And so we don't have sort of specific
rules to optimize our situation here.

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,360
And further more,
you know,

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,810
I'm mode of communication,
verbal communication and written

13
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:45,860
communication is Israel to be slow
compared to the sort of the mass media

14
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:47,570
and the all of the information that we
have now.

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,280
So there's some sort of fascinating,
uh,

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,670
challenges from a biological perspective
to the,

17
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:54,560
to our societies.
Um,

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,670
but what we do find is that people are
good at learning how to behave in

19
00:00:58,671 --> 00:00:59,090
crates.

20
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,270
For example,
if you were to take people from,

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,670
I don't know,
the central of America who've never been

22
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:07,220
to a large city and pop them in the
middle of Manhattan,

23
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,680
and alternately would this be a sort of
cultural shock,

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,590
we would actually be difficult for them
to behave within these crates.

25
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,070
These are sort of learnt behaviors that
you sort of try things out and you

26
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:19,400
eventually kind of optimize how to
behave within these environments.

27
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,670
And when we film and we track people
within crites,

28
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,040
what sort of astonishes me is high
predictable from a statistical

29
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,800
perspective,
how predictable crowds are.

30
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,840
And so each individual,
we can't necessarily predict whether

31
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:35,900
you're going to go left or right,
but when we start getting large groups

32
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:38,660
of individuals,
we can predict properties like how many

33
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:41,660
lanes will form or you know,
what certain times a day,

34
00:01:41,661 --> 00:01:43,750
who,
who will generally tend to move where.

35
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,890
Um,
and we can also make predictions about

36
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:48,380
congestion in these environments and so
forth.

37
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,430
[inaudible].
