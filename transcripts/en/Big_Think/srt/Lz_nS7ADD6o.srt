1
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,430
Very common.
Sorry,

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,160
I'm a professor of psychology at Rutgers
University in Newark,

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,630
New Jersey.
Well,

4
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:21,631
it was an interesting research study by
events and Wagner that was done in 1975.

5
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:25,180
It was a long time ago,
but it was a very interesting study

6
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:28,240
where they,
they asked men and women to describe

7
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:29,900
their orgasms,
uh,

8
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:31,690
in writing.
And then they,

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,720
they remove all the specific references
to the genitals.

10
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:39,990
So you couldn't tell whether it was,
uh,

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,820
a man or a woman.
These were college students,

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,430
uh,
describing their orgasms.

13
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,960
And then they,
they,

14
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:48,030
uh,
gave the,

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,130
the descriptions.
Each one was about a short paragraph of

16
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:53,410
the description of,
of the orgasm they gave.

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,170
They gave the descriptions too.
Um,

18
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,090
uh,
sex therapists and,

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,040
and,
um,

20
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,400
uh,
various experts in sexuality and mds

21
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:04,121
and,
and,

22
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:05,390
uh,
uh,

23
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,510
asking,
can you tell which one is written by a,

24
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,030
uh,
a male on which is written by a female?

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:18,370
And the upshot of the experiment was
that they couldn't tell the difference.

26
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:22,660
They couldn't identify accurately
whether the description of the orgasm

27
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,730
was made by a man or a woman.
Uh,

28
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,120
so on that basis,
my conclusion and their conclusion is

29
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:31,840
that,
uh,

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,260
the,
the feelings of orgasm when you remove

31
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:40,261
the specific reference to the genitals,
which would difference between the

32
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:42,430
genitals and the sexist,
uh,

33
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,870
that the feelings of the organism are
indistinguishable from each other for

34
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,770
between men and women.

35
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,550
Well,
we don't really know why some women

36
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,770
can't experience orgasms.
Um,

37
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,060
actually,
uh,

38
00:01:59,061 --> 00:01:59,900
that was,
uh,

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,040
I started out by,
uh,

40
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,320
uh,
some years ago,

41
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,830
uh,
trying to find women who don't

42
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:08,320
experience Orgasms,
uh,

43
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:13,160
to study them in looking at their brain
activity during genital self

44
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:16,490
stimulation.
And we identified one woman and she,

45
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:19,160
uh,
but just before she came to our lab,

46
00:02:19,161 --> 00:02:23,330
she said she got a new boyfriend and now
she's had her orgasm first orgasm.

47
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,800
So that,
uh,

48
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,600
that,
that did it for that experiment.

49
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:27,320
So,
uh,

50
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,020
we're still looking and it is a very
interesting question.

51
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:31,010
We don't,
we don't really know.

52
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:32,660
I mean,
certainly there are,

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,130
there are situations in which,
um,

54
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,660
with a peripheral nerve damage or
diabetes,

55
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:42,400
these can impede the neural transmission
descent,

56
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,960
the,
the,

57
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,500
the sensory nerves as much more rare.
In the,

58
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:46,920
in the case of men,
um,

59
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,490
Kinsey,
uh,

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,130
reported that only,
uh,

61
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,620
uh,
a few,

62
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:53,750
uh,
two or three of the men that they

63
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:56,560
interviewed out of many hundreds,
uh,

64
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,940
could have orgasms by thought.

65
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,580
But,
uh,

66
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:05,581
we have found a substantial number of
women who can have orgasms just by

67
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:07,200
thinking and,
uh,

68
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,850
we've studied them and we're continuing
to study them.

69
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,800
It's really very interesting.
Uh,

70
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,461
the,
the,

71
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:13,570
uh,
we have,

72
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,250
we measured their heart rate and blood
pressure and pain thresholds,

73
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,400
which is a pain thresholds go up during
orgasm.

74
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,300
In other words,
women,

75
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,570
we found that women become much less
sensitive to pain during orgasm and also

76
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:31,240
the pupils dilate and all those
measures,

77
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,590
the heart rate,
blood pressure,

78
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:37,090
pain thresholds and pupil dilation,
they all about doubled during orgasm,

79
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,880
generated by,
uh,

80
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,590
uh,
genital self stimulation.

81
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,350
What we've found is that women,
we had 10 women in the laboratory who

82
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:50,470
said that they could have orgasms just
by thought.

83
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,620
And we measured their physiological
responses when they applied a genital

84
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:58,660
self stimulation,
actual physical stimulation.

85
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,010
And then we compared it with when they
said that they had orgasms by thought

86
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:06,160
alone,
and the physiological responses were

87
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:07,060
essentially the same.

88
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,530
There were,
there were indistinguishable.

89
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,520
In other words,
they,

90
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,460
those women were really having orgasms
just by thinking.

91
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,863
And,
um,

92
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,690
there were,
they had different ideas.

93
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:19,330
We asked them what,
what they,

94
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,110
uh,
what their thought process is to elicit

95
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:26,830
the orgasm.
And some said that they had erotic

96
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,920
imagery,
but others said that they had,

97
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,790
um,
uh,

98
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,070
pastor al imagery,
like walking along the shore on a,

99
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:35,150
on a warm summer day.
Um,

100
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,130
other women had a much more abstract
image such as,

101
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:40,090
uh,
uh,

102
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:41,500
imagining the,
uh,

103
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,690
energy,
uh,

104
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,660
moving up and down their bodies.
The shocker is moving up and down the

105
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,160
bodies,
um,

106
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,320
and,
and producing the orgasm.

107
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,640
So,
uh,

108
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,760
they're a big individual differences.
And now we're looking at their brain

109
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:58,060
activity in a women who,
uh,

110
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,740
have orgasms by thought alone.
And we're seeing very,

111
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:07,741
a great similarities between when they
have orgasms by just thinking and

112
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:10,330
orgasms when they,
uh,

113
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,523
do,
uh,

114
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,360
genital self stimulation.

115
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,410
We're starting to study men and,
uh,

116
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,830
it's a very good question,
but we don't really know what,

117
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,580
uh,
what the differences,

118
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,600
it seems to be much more rare in men
than in women.

119
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,880
Uh,
one,

120
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,910
one of the things that,
um,

121
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,140
uh,
we'd be,

122
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,630
we'll be looking for is,
uh,

123
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:42,100
one of the things we're finding a really
very new findings is that when,

124
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,790
uh,
when women think of different parts of

125
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,250
their body,
uh,

126
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,370
the,
the,

127
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:51,250
uh,
thinking about those parts of the body

128
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,640
activates the,
the sensory cortex.

129
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:55,691
Uh,
there's a,

130
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:58,730
there's a map of the body on the sensory
cortex.

131
00:05:58,731 --> 00:05:59,990
In other words,
is the,

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,310
the fingers are in one place and the
toes are represented in another place.

133
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,260
The face is represented in another
place,

134
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,700
the genitals in another place.
Um,

135
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,050
and it's all systematically laid out
very much like the body.

136
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,260
The body plan is laid out on the,
on the sensory cortex.

137
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,650
And what we're finding is that when
women think about their finger being

138
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,310
stimulated,
or they think,

139
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,030
think about their toe being stimulated,
or they think about their,

140
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,893
their,
uh,

141
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,030
uh,
clutter is being stimulated or the

142
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:30,710
nipple that,
uh,

143
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,320
the,
the corresponding part of the body,

144
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,880
uh,
in the,

145
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,290
the,
the representation of,

146
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,820
in the sensory cortex of those body
parts is actually activated just as if

147
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:43,190
they're really being stimulated
physically.

148
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,010
Uh,
so I think one of the interesting

149
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:50,510
questions is whether since women can
think their genital,

150
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,620
uh,
systems into actual physical,

151
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,400
into actual activity in the brain,
can men do the same thing?

152
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,240
If they can't,
then that might be a way of

153
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:06,830
understanding why women can have orgasms
by thought alone.

154
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,050
Are they activating their genital sis,
their genital sensory representation,

155
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,960
which then spreads to other parts of the
brain and can mend,

156
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:19,940
not do that or we don't really know,
but we have the tools to investigate

157
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:20,774
that.

158
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,210
That's an interesting,
interesting that you asked that question

159
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:28,460
because we're really dealing with that
right now.

160
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,690
Uh,
because we have a,

161
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,543
a,
um,

162
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,330
we want to see,
since we know that if you think about

163
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,180
your,
think about the clearest.

164
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,420
So think about the,
uh,

165
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:41,630
the g spot.
We'll think about the cervix that those,

166
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,260
that the,
the corresponding part of the bottom of

167
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:47,930
the brain map for those parts of the
body,

168
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,240
those become activated.
So,

169
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:55,070
uh,
one question is whether a women who can

170
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,450
think themselves to orgasm,
do they think their genital activation,

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,680
the brain,
a representation of the Genitalia into

172
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:05,120
act,
into activity,

173
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,320
and does that spread to the other
systems that are involved in orgasm?

174
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,560
How do they do it?
We want to understand how they do it

175
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:15,350
normally.
And then the question is,

176
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,910
what if we,
uh,

177
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,180
ask women to think about the Janet the
genitals,

178
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,220
um,
more intensively or will we,

179
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,670
will we,
will they be able to intensify the

180
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,040
response in their genital sensory
cortex?

181
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,140
And will that spread to other parts of
the brain?

182
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,990
Will that facilitate their orgasm?
I'd be,

183
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:40,910
I think it could be very useful in,
in women who say that they don't

184
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:44,960
experience orgasms.
It could be a useful in women with

185
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:49,880
spinal cord injury who can't feel their,
their external genitals.

186
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,240
Can they,
can they think their a brain greater

187
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:59,190
activation and will that facilitate
their orgasm?

188
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,600
That's a,
it's a,

189
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:03,870
um,
it's a question that we are currently

190
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,010
dealing with it without a brain research
and it's a,

191
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:11,930
it's a very important and interesting
question and it could be therapeutic for

192
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:15,030
therapeutically useful.
One of the techniques that we're,

193
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,440
that we've developed is to have the
women in the scanner,

194
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,620
uh,
looking at their own brain activity in

195
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:24,690
near real time.
Uh,

196
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:29,400
and the question is if we can see our
own brain activity in near real time in

197
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:34,401
specific regions,
can we voluntarily increase the activity

198
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,880
of that part of the brain?

199
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,820
Just by thinking about it?
Uh,

200
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,670
just as um,
as we can think about moving our finger

201
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:43,440
and we can,
we can move our finger.

202
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:46,260
We can wiggle a finger.
We don't know what we do.

203
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,671
Uh,
we,

204
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:51,690
we learned to do it as an infant cause
we got the feedback between what we see

205
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,950
and what we,
what we do.

206
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,230
Maybe we can do the same thing with the
brain.

207
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,000
If we see our own brain activity,
uh,

208
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:03,260
maybe we can make a change and maybe
that's going to change the way we feel

209
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:06,110
or the way we move.
Uh,

210
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,650
so this is a,
uh,

211
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,660
a new technology of near real time brain
imaging and,

212
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,620
uh,
with,

213
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:14,820
uh,
unlimited,

214
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,691
uh,
frontiers.

215
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:17,850
We don't really know how,
uh,

216
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,980
how far we can go with that,
but it's a,

217
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:21,390
it's a new,
it's a new approach.
