1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,660
I've been working in music,
I've been playing since I was a kid.

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,210
Uh,
but in the industry itself,

3
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:16,320
the first record I ever played on that
was a major record was Lauren Hill's

4
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:19,380
album,
the miseducation of Lauryn Hill back in

5
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:22,170
1998.
I was still in college at University of

6
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:24,780
Pennsylvania.
I had a friend who was a friend of

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,520
Lawrence and she introduced me to her.
This was after the success of the score

8
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:32,340
by the foods eat.
And so lauren was a big star and

9
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:35,840
everyone was anticipating or solo album.
And uh,

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,450
I went to the studio with them one day
and just hung out.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,433
And,
uh,

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,760
she,
uh,

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,790
heard me saying,
I played a couple songs for her and she

14
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:48,090
thought it sounded good and wanted me to
play piano on the track she was working

15
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,620
on.
So I did it.

16
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,140
I played on it and,
uh,

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,750
she liked what I did and,
uh,

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,900
she kept it on the album.

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,670
Song was called everything is
everything,

20
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:59,580
which was a pretty big hit back in 98,
99.

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,751
And,
uh,

22
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:04,860
I was just really proud to be a part of
such an important album and that was my

23
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:08,880
first entry into the big time,
the big leagues,

24
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,080
uh,
of the music business.

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,570
But it was just a session.
I just play the piano.

26
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:14,490
And that was that.
Um,

27
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,390
as I progressed as a writer and as a
singer,

28
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,630
I worked with different producers,
some in Philly.

29
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:23,010
So I'm in New York and,
uh,

30
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,460
I put a couple of different variations
of my band together and I just kept

31
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,840
trying to get a record deal.
Uh,

32
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,870
I would play at local clubs in New York
and Philadelphia,

33
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,140
sometimes Atlanta,
sometimes DC,

34
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,850
just trying to get some buzz and
building an audience.

35
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,560
And it kept building and building.
Uh,

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,730
a couple of years into me living in New
York,

37
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:47,760
I met Kanye West,
who at the time was still an unknown

38
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:51,930
producer from Chicago who had just moved
out to the east coast.

39
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,160
He was the,
uh,

40
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,250
he is the cousin of a,
one of my good friends,

41
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:59,940
Devonne Harris,
who is also a producer and one of my

42
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:02,130
classmates from college.
And,

43
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:03,720
uh,
we started working together,

44
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,960
Kanye and I,
and I think that was the biggest,

45
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,650
uh,
uh,

46
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,050
different maker in my career.
Uh,

47
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,060
when I started working with him,
his star was just starting to ascend

48
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,410
and,
uh,

49
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,710
uh,
I kind of hitched on to that and,

50
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:23,880
uh,
his ascension really helped me get

51
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:28,710
noticed by the right people and we made
some really cool music together.

52
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,250
Him and I,
uh,

53
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,280
on his project and,
uh,

54
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,270
also,
uh,

55
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:36,660
on my own project and other people's
projects like slum village,

56
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:37,980
Alicia keys,
Jay z,

57
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,210
all these things were happening before I
got a record deal and they were helping

58
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:46,770
me get the buzz and the energy around my
project that I needed to get a record

59
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:48,420
deal.
And finally,

60
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:51,570
in 2004,
I signed with Sony through Connie's

61
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:56,571
imprint and I released my first album
get lifted in December of 2014.

62
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,050
It really hasn't changed a lot.
Uh,

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,210
we were never close friends.
Uh,

64
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,930
in the beginning it was more of a
professional relationship that developed

65
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:12,990
into a friendship.
And we're still friends and we still,

66
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:15,060
you know,
joke around in the same way we did

67
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,700
before.
We still work together in a similar way

68
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,490
that we did before.
And I think we still have a respect for

69
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,920
each other's creativity,
uh,

70
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,330
that we did before.
And,

71
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:25,260
uh,
I,

72
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,970
I believe Kanye is one of the most
important creative minds and music right

73
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:32,310
now.
And I'm excited to still be able to

74
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:32,490
work.
