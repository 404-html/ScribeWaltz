1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,400
Or the primary objective of the World
Bank is to help developing countries

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,400
grow and develop.
And our main objective is to help

3
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:17,970
countries reduce poverty.
So the World Bank has a long history of

4
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:21,570
working in China on different types of
projects that have helped reduce

5
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:22,820
poverty.
Uh,

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,770
but personally I interpret this mandate
quite broadly.

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,540
I moved to China three years ago for
this assignment and I've come to think

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:34,650
that the key challenge that China faces
is really environmental management,

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,800
natural resource scarcity,
you know,

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,920
water,
energy,

11
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:42,240
these key resource issues.
So I think that the impressive poverty

12
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:46,920
reduction that China has achieved is not
going to be sustainable unless China

13
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,590
really comes to grip with these
environmental challenges.

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,820
So on a practical level,
I've tried to shift our World Bank

15
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:57,900
program to support a lot of different
environmental activities in China,

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,800
in the water sector,
developing new energy sources.

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,881
You know,
for example,

18
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:07,881
we financed the first big wind power
wind power station in China and

19
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:10,530
demonstrated that this is economically
viable.

20
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,490
We finance different types of clean
energy technologies.

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,170
So I guess I see what I'm doing is
working with Chinese partners to help

22
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:21,740
them address some of their key
challenges and,

23
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,260
and that goes beyond environment.
But a lot of our work now is focused on

24
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:26,250
the environmental area.
