1
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,820
From Texas,
my question is,

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,910
how do you reach someone who was maybe a
conspiracy theorist or someone who is a

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,230
anti vaccines?
I'm someone who is staunchly,

4
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:25,280
scientifically,
scientifically illiterate and agree with

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,340
them on what a good source of facts is.
Thank you.

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,460
So Daniel,
how do I.

7
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,640
How do I recommend reasoning with a
conspiracy theorist?

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,680
I'm right now,
the last couple months I've been messing

9
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:44,900
around with this idea of cognitive
dissonance.

10
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,130
This is to say you have a worldview.
You're presented with evidence that

11
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:52,310
conflicts with the worldview so you.
You either have to change your

12
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:54,590
worldview,
which is hard because you've lived your

13
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:58,250
whole life with it,
or you just dismiss the evidence and

14
00:00:58,251 --> 00:01:01,610
dismissed the authorities that may have
provided the evidence.

15
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:06,380
The authority can be a person or it
could be a book or shoot me an article

16
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:10,550
in the new electric Internet computer
machine to so you dismiss the evidence

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,630
so that you don't have this discomfort,
this conflict in your mind,

18
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,510
this dissonance,
and that's what I'm working with right

19
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:20,360
now and apparently the way to overcome
that is to say,

20
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:22,940
we're all in this together.
Let's learn about this together,

21
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,970
present the conspiracy theorists with
the idea that he or she may be rejecting

22
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:32,660
evidence because it's just so
uncomfortable that you're in it

23
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:33,140
together.

24
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,060
We're in it together.
I'm uncomfortable too,

25
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,270
but when it comes to moon landings,
just ask the person and how you would

26
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,780
generate all that paperwork,
the warehouses full of documentation,

27
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:49,781
but national NASA created a to make
landings on the moon would overwhelm any

28
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,930
anybody trying to do it on the side.
You just,

29
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:57,800
it just be very difficult to print all
that and just understand it's a process.

30
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:01,910
Somebody who has a worldview that's
inconsistent with evidence and I may

31
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:03,520
have some,
uh,

32
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,110
it,
it takes a while for you to turn around,

33
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,320
like the example of palm reading or
astrology.

34
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:13,160
It's not something people reverse their
ideas about immediately.

35
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,830
It takes,
in my experience,

36
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,980
takes about two years for somebody to
sort of look at palm reading,

37
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,940
look at cold reading or a Tarot card
reading for a while,

38
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:26,000
and then realized that these Tarot card
readers,

39
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:28,790
palm readers,
are just taking information that you've

40
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,950
given them,
the clients given them and feeding back

41
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:31,430
to you.

42
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,580
It takes a long time in the same way
people who,

43
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:37,070
uh,
who are anti-vaccine,

44
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,790
I think I've just lost sight of the
history.

45
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,730
Vaccines,
you know,

46
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,580
part of the reason I'm able to be here
talking with you is my grandparents did

47
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:51,581
not die in 1918 during the Spanish flu
when it has estimated 50 million people

48
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:56,540
died twice as many peoples were killed
in combat,

49
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,870
in World War One died of this disease.
If you go to old cemeteries,

50
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,790
you can see these tombstones of very
young people died of the flu.

51
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,210
So people just lost sight of history and
you can,

52
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,470
we all tend to go,
well,

53
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:10,960
look at the facts,
change your mind,

54
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,630
but it takes people a couple of years to
change their minds.

55
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:15,820
So my recommendation,
Daniel,

56
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,920
is stick with it.
You'll get frustrated.

57
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,620
The person will get but present the idea
of cognitive dissonance.

58
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:28,621
This is my latest idea about a way to
work together to a scientific

59
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:31,720
understanding.
