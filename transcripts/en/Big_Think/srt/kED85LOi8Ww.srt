1
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,650
I think,
you know,

2
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,480
during a downturn,
you know,

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,470
how much is advertising going to drop
by?

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,600
Well,
it may drop by,

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,190
you know,
three percent,

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,740
five percent.
It shouldn't be a total disaster for

7
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:28,450
anybody except those who are really on
the margin.

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,900
Uh,
at the same time I think we're still

9
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:35,901
though we're experiencing a very
longterm trend towards Internet based

10
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:42,201
advertising away from traditional media
and that is probably a big enough factor

11
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:49,461
that it would override for our industry.
Any downturn in general ad revenues,

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,400
uh,
I think that what we haven't seen in the

13
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:55,210
past,
but I think I agree with John Battelle,

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,230
who says that we sort of went down the
rat hole of a paper click advertising

15
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:05,220
for a long time and uh,
that the,

16
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:08,700
the idea of,
of brand advertising,

17
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,140
uh,
is one that,

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,410
that has not gotten,
has gotten its due,

19
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:14,690
um,
in,

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,260
in the online space.

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,600
I think it's because clicks are
measurable.

22
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:22,200
People over focused on clicks as a
measure of the effectiveness of the ad.

23
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,030
And so we haven't seen a lot of really,
really big advertisers doing all that

24
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:28,340
much online.
Uh,

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,790
but I think that'll change.
I mean,

26
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,570
just the idea that,
uh,

27
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,890
you know,
so pick your random big hepatitis or

28
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,220
like coca cola or Mcdonald's,
right?

29
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,190
Well,
they're not selling Coca Cola online

30
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,880
that it's not an ecommerce product and
never will be mcdonalds,

31
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:46,200
same thing.
Uh,

32
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,660
and so measuring the success of a,
of an advertisement online by click

33
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:53,280
through rate and the number of people
who came and played with your stupid

34
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:55,030
flash animation,
uh,

35
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,640
maybe not that great,
right?

36
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,010
I think instead they have to step back
and say,

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,730
oh,
actually,

38
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,470
this is kind of like TV,
right?

39
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:03,690
It's kind of like a billboard.
We put up a billboard,

40
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:04,710
we know how many people see it.

41
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,390
We really have,
um,

42
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,860
some historical understanding of what
that might mean for people thinking

43
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:13,320
about coke when they go to buy a
beverage next time.

44
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,780
Uh,
but we need a lot more of that on the

45
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:17,220
web just to say,
look,

46
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,980
actually we're gonna,
we're gonna Mention Koch's name in a

47
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:24,060
banner ad or in a little sidebar ad.
And we really don't care if people click

48
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,110
on it.
We really don't care.

49
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,540
It's not about that.
It's actually just getting that word in

50
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,630
front of people every day so that when
they do get ready to think about it,

51
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,740
that's one type of product.
Another type of product would be a very

52
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:39,090
information dense product.
So something like a Toyota Prius right

53
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,960
there.
I think that the lure of interactive

54
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:45,340
advertising is to actually,
um,

55
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,290
it is a bit ecommerce.
It is a bit get people to come and play

56
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:52,440
with your stupid flash site,
although hopefully it's not a stupid

57
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:53,040
flash site.

58
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,400
Hopefully,
uh,

59
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,430
you can say in that space,
look,

60
00:02:56,431 --> 00:03:01,431
we actually feel like this is a product
that more people would want to buy a if

61
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:03,280
they understood it better,
right?

62
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,440
If we do research and we say,
well,

63
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,540
people kind of liked the idea of a
cleaner,

64
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,630
greener car with better gas mileage.
Uh,

65
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,730
but they're,
they heard it some kind of hybrid and

66
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:14,340
maybe they're a little scared of it and
they don't know,

67
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,220
you know,
does it run out of electricity or what

68
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,420
is that all about?
I don't know what the problems they face

69
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:20,710
are.
I'm just being hypothetical,

70
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,740
but it is a product where you can
imagine that lots of people would like

71
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:26,800
to go and learn more about it and then
actually maybe click and buy it,

72
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,800
you know.
So I think there's still like tons and

73
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,670
tons of room for a lot more ad money to
flow into this space away from

74
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,290
traditional models.
Uh,

75
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,280
and that'll,
that'll be a stronger effect than,

76
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:37,850
than anything.
