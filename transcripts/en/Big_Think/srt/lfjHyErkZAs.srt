1
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,120
I spent a lot of time looking at foreign
models.

2
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:17,260
I actually
chaired this year,

3
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:21,430
the health governors at the World
Economic Congress in Davos and I'm the

4
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:26,320
current chair of the International
Federation of Health plans and health

5
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:28,150
plans from 80 countries around the
world.

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,760
And so I meet all the time with health
plans from,

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,930
from those other countries.
And I've been looking hard to figure out

8
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:39,400
which attributes of those plans would
fit in the US.

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,450
And one of the things I've learned from
working with all those countries is that

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,340
every single one does it a little
differently.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,300
So the model in Germany looks a lot like
the Netherlands,

12
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:52,630
but it's not quite the same Austria
different than both those,

13
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:56,030
but the quite similar fact.
The model had governor Schwarzenegger

14
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,590
proposed in California last year looks
suspiciously like the Australian model,

15
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,050
uh,
that every country does it slightly

16
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:08,200
differently.
But if I were going to pick a model that

17
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,680
I think
would,

18
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,010
would transplant,
well,

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,630
it's actually the Dutch model.

20
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,810
I think the Dutch have done some really
good things and the thing that they have

21
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:21,811
added to their model more recently is a
risk adjuster between the health plan.

22
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:27,701
So when the health plans go out and
recruit members and enroll people,

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,530
uh,
the government in the end does a,

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,180
an assessment of who got the healthy
people who got the less healthy people

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,060
and if any health plan,
God,

26
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:37,840
a disproportionate number of healthy
people,

27
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:39,760
they have to actually pay some money
back into the pool.

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,330
And any health plan got too many sick
people.

29
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,960
They get more money from the pool.
And so what that does is strongly

30
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:48,700
encouraged,
as we were saying earlier,

31
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,840
the health plans to go after the sicker
people and do a really good job taking

32
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,330
care of sick people.
Because I know in the end they get

33
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:59,020
arrested the adjuster from the other
plants that enrolled healthier people.

34
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,240
So I think the Dutch model of having a
payroll deduction,

35
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,670
individual choice of health plans and
then the risk adjuster on the back end

36
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,250
has a lot to offer,
but it's a federal model.

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,320
They basically,
in the end of the year,

38
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:20,020
run the core information about each
health by how many diabetics do they

39
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:21,310
have,
how many congestive heart failure

40
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:23,170
patients,
how many asthmatic.

41
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,280
They sort through the whole thing,
and then basically when a formula and if

42
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:31,450
you have enrolled a disproportionate
number of people with those expensive

43
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:36,451
diseases in the high level of morbidity,
they increase your payment or if it's a

44
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:43,000
low level of decrease your payment,
and actually we do that to some degree

45
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:45,430
in this country on our Medicare
advantage program.

46
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,450
There's already we have a risk adjuster
formula that works in America.

47
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,820
It's a pretty good formula.
It's not perfect,

48
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:54,930
but it's a lot better than no formula,
and so we.

49
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,900
We already have a history of doing that.
We could.

50
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,770
I could adapt to the Dutch model

51
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,330
for.
