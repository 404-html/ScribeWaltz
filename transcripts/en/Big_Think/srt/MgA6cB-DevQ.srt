1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,520
So a

2
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,083
what,

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,720
what triggers a panic attack is,

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,163
hm,

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,220
I'm hesitating because there's sort of
two main models of this.

6
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:27,370
I mean,
one is that I guess the both of them

7
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:29,650
center on the idea that,
um,

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,940
that everyone is capable of having a
panic attack you for it.

9
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:37,140
If a tiger suddenly ran into the room,
you would probably have a tie,

10
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,170
a panic attack.
And so that means that we have the brain

11
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:46,171
circuitry to have a panic attack.
And the idea is that that,

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,080
that the,
that the circuitry is meant to be

13
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:55,081
triggered by actual immediate danger.
And people who have clinical panic

14
00:00:57,281 --> 00:01:00,790
attacks have those attacks without,
you know,

15
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:04,020
when there is no real danger.
And so what we think is that this,

16
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,680
the,
the trigger is,

17
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,430
um,
it is more easily set off so to speak.

18
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,380
Now,
what sets it off?

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,520
Um,
it,

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,390
it can almost be like a loose wire.
You could think of it as a loose wire in

21
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:18,160
your fire alarm system or something.

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,700
So it can,
sometimes it can just just set off.

23
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,210
But,
um,

24
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:28,530
a lot of times there's a lot of evidence
that what triggers a panic attack is a,

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,200
an actual bodily sensation of the sort
that you have when you have anxiety.

26
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:38,410
So if you think about adrenaline rush,
you have heart palpitations,

27
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:41,440
you get a little short of breath,
you feel a little shaky,

28
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,410
sweaty,
any of those kinds of feelings,

29
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,200
um,
can trigger it kind of,

30
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,420
um,
what we call catastrophic

31
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:53,830
misinterpretations on the part of the
person who's prone to having panic

32
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:54,880
attacks.
So that there,

33
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,690
what we know about such people is that
they're

34
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,210
more sensitive than the rest of us to
the bodily sensations to start with.

35
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:04,961
So if,
you know,

36
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:06,280
if you had,
for example,

37
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:09,580
panic attacks,
you would be better able to tell me

38
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:12,430
right now what your heart rate is.
Then I would be able to tell you.

39
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,640
And so there's that sensitivity start
with,

40
00:02:15,641 --> 00:02:19,300
and then then something starts your
heart racing.

41
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:21,580
And that could be running up a flight of
stairs.

42
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:24,430
It could be I'm drinking a cup of
coffee.

43
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:27,010
It could be getting mad at someone,
you know,

44
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:29,830
any of those kinds of things.
Your heart starts to race and all of a

45
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:34,630
sudden you sense that pretty early on
when it starts to beat faster and all of

46
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:39,631
a sudden you are feeling it and you
think your mind automatically thinks

47
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,900
something terrible's happening.
Something very dangerous is happening

48
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,500
within your body.
You might be having,

49
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,640
he might think you're having a heart
attack or a stroke or some such thing.

50
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,310
And so that is frightening in itself.
Right?

51
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:56,311
So then that triggers more fear,
more bodily sensations in your

52
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,413
continuing.

53
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,571
Sure.
I mean,

54
00:03:02,571 --> 00:03:03,231
that's,
you know,

55
00:03:03,231 --> 00:03:08,231
I think that,
that the treatments that we do that have

56
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:13,541
been proven to be helpful for people
center on kind of desensitize.

57
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,200
It's almost like you have a phobia of
your own bodily sensations.

58
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,590
So you know how we work with phobias.
If you were afraid of cats,

59
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,470
I'm someone who's afraid of cats.
We put them in front of cats,

60
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,330
right?
So that they essentially learn.

61
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,240
The cats really aren't that dangerous.
And um,

62
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:34,270
and so we follow that same principle
with panic attacks and we evoke bodily

63
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:35,600
sensations.
So,

64
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:36,434
in,
in,

65
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,330
you know,
we might have someone run in place in

66
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:41,850
the office and their heart starts to
race and then they see that they're,

67
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,210
yeah,
that's a normal reaction to running in

68
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:44,990
place.
And,

69
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,560
you know,
we're,

70
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,560
we're sort of there with them and
helping them with that and we basically

71
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,350
desensitize them and,
and you know,

72
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:55,390
and teach them also what is behind a
panic attack?

73
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,213
Well,
you know,

74
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,750
um,
that's,

75
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,960
that's a question that's,
that's a very good question because

76
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,260
that's what we're grappling with right
this minute in the new diagnostic system

77
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:10,980
that's being,
you know,

78
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:12,960
the,
every so often we rewrite the

79
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,710
psychiatric diagnostic system.
And so one of the big questions is,

80
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:20,190
you know,
should we be looking at anxiety and mood

81
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:21,180
and,
and,

82
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,600
um,
other kinds of psychological problems on

83
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:27,390
a dimensional scale like that.
And,

84
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,370
um,
and if so,

85
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,110
where's the cutoff?
You know,

86
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:34,110
and,
and so it's probably not just in one

87
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:36,450
place.
Now the skills that I've developed,

88
00:04:36,451 --> 00:04:41,220
where are ones that are focused very
much so on diagnoses that we already

89
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:42,810
make.
And so there,

90
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,470
um,
the cutoff is,

91
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,500
is based basically determined by when we
can diagnose panic disorder for example,

92
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:54,060
of the panic disorder severity scale.
We can say that,

93
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,950
you know,
I can tell you a number,

94
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:59,430
but you know,
there's a number that corresponds to the

95
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:00,690
best,
um,

96
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,000
kind of indicator that someone will have
a diagnosis of panic disorder.

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,030
So that's how we do that.
But,

98
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,260
you know,
but there is the,

99
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,960
it's absolutely true that there's a
dimension,

100
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,770
you know,
these symptoms occur in a dimensional

101
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:18,670
way such that,
um,

102
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,400
there certainly there's normal anxiety
and um,

103
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,500
and there's normal panic even,
even though so panics different from

104
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:28,320
anxiety because panic is an immediate
fear reaction,

105
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:30,720
right?
Whereas anxiety is more something we

106
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:34,710
think is going to happen in the future.
So panic occurs when you think,

107
00:05:34,711 --> 00:05:36,510
like I said before,
if there's a tiger in the room,

108
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:39,540
someone's pointing a gun at you,
it's something that looks like it's the

109
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,910
future,
but it's the immediate future as opposed

110
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:42,930
to,
you know,

111
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:45,990
I'm anxious about a test I'm going to
have to take next week or something.
