00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,620
Hi there.
I'm Jason Guts and you're listening to

2
00:00:02,621 --> 00:00:04,680
think again.
A big thing podcast

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:15,180
since 2008 big thing has been sharing
the big ideas in little doses from some

4
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:19,480
of the most creative thinkers around on
the thing against podcast.

5
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:21,400
We take ourselves out of our comfort
zone.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,700
Surprising my guests and me are hosts
with unexpected interview clips from big

7
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:28,600
thinks,
archives,

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,700
uh,
ideas that we didn't necessarily come

9
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:34,780
here prepared to discuss today.
I'm so happy to be joined by Professor

10
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:39,781
Eric Kandel of Columbia University in
the year 2000 he won the Nobel prize in

11
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:44,110
physiology or medicine for pioneering
work on understanding how memory is

12
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:48,100
stored in the brain by studying a
particular type of sea snail with a

13
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:51,100
relatively simple nervous system.
In his recent books,

14
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:55,510
he's been pioneering in a very different
way trying to bridge the gap between the

15
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:58,630
quote unquote two cultures of the
sciences and the humanities.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,560
His current book,
reductionism in art and brain science

17
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,770
continues this word looking at the ways
both modern art and science reduced

18
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:12,190
complex phenomena down into their
component parts to achieve new insights

19
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:14,200
and effects.
Welcome to think again.

20
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:16,510
Professor Kendall.
Thank you very much.

21
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,100
I guess maybe we should start with the
cultural divide between the humanities

22
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:24,430
and the sciences.
I mean this is a very big topic,

23
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:29,080
but maybe you want to start with a bit
of an overview of how that happened.

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,980
Yes.
I mean this was in the late 1950

25
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:37,981
[inaudible] and early 1960s CP snow
wrote a series of give a series of

26
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:42,570
lectures and motor series of essays on
the divide between the humanities and

27
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:46,770
the sciences.
He thought that this was an bridgeable

28
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:51,771
divide because humanists and scientists
are not only had different aspirations,

29
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:56,610
different goals,
but use different methodologies.

30
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,920
And the point that I tried to make in
this book,

31
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:03,921
the overriding theme is that humanistic
aspirations are not unique to people who

32
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,430
called humanists,
but scientists can also have humanistic

33
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:12,030
aspirations and all in modesty I can say
the,

34
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,700
the study of learning and memory is a
humanistic idea.

35
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:19,140
We all want to understand who we are
because who we are is in large part

36
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:24,141
dependent on what we remember about
ourselves and that has a biological

37
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,220
base,
the biological basis memory.

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,590
In addition,
not only do scientists have humanistic

39
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:36,450
goals,
but artists use empirical scientific

40
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:40,890
experimental methods.
And my book shows several examples of

41
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:44,430
this.
Jackson pollock taking the canvas off

42
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,800
the wall and putting it on the floor and
flipping on it.

43
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,800
This is a completely new approach to
painting,

44
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,700
right?
If you could give it a little,

45
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,760
a brief overview of what what you mean
by reductionism because the term has

46
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:59,290
many meanings.
Some of them pejorative,

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,890
you're not using it in that way here.
Like maybe you could talk about what

48
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,840
reductionism is and how it,
you know,

49
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,030
broadly it's common to art and science,

50
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,190
right?
Reduction is a miss taking a complex

51
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:15,191
problem that interests you and taking
one component of that problem and going

52
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:18,710
into the great depth.
So for example,

53
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,690
on the cover of my book,
I have an image by Rothko who's a color

54
00:03:23,691 --> 00:03:28,691
field painter and he's decided that he
can convey emotions most effectively by

55
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:35,060
using color.
And he uses stripes of color in many of

56
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:38,870
his paintings to convey a feeling that
it's almost spiritual.

57
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,110
And as he aged and also became more
depressed,

58
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,650
the colors change became darker.
And the Rothko Chapel,

59
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,390
they're dark browns and blacks and silly
conveys a powerful mood in this way.

60
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,340
So this clearly is a reductionist
approach.

61
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:55,580
He has a chance of doing many things
besides colors,

62
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,800
pick,
use figuration and addition color,

63
00:03:57,801 --> 00:04:00,920
but it drops out.
Figuration focuses only on color and

64
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:05,660
simplifies the color pattern and yet we
get a powerful response to it.

65
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,380
And this is a,
yeah,

66
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,350
correct me if I'm wrong,
but the way I'm thinking about it,

67
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,620
the goal of reductionism in science at
least as you describe it in the book

68
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:19,830
specifically,
I'm using the example of your work with

69
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:22,680
sea snails.
You know you are trying to understand

70
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:27,681
the complex phenomenon of memory by
looking at a relatively simple nervous

71
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:32,280
system,
but your goal is to understand that

72
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:35,850
phenomenon.
Whereas the artists that you describe

73
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,060
what they're trying to do seems to be
less about understanding maybe then

74
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:46,701
about getting at some more immediate
experience or provoking some kind of

75
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,410
response in themselves or in the viewer
could,

76
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,590
could you speak to that a bit?

77
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,401
Yes.
I mean you,

78
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:58,401
you described it perfectly.
Reductionism need not simply solve a

79
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:02,740
scientific problem,
although in a sense every artist's

80
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:05,530
solves scientific problems along the
way.

81
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,270
But it may be that of the range of
emotional experiences.

82
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,530
The artists were only focused on some
rather than others in order to go into

83
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:16,900
it in some depth.
So for example,

84
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:21,901
I mean the history of art from Giotto to
1852 claude monet was figuration,

85
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,800
the whole idea of art was to deceive the
viewer and to thinking that when they

86
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:32,230
were looking at a flat surface,
they were in fact seeing a three

87
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:37,231
dimensional world and the whole autistic
capability critically involved trying to

88
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:40,450
develop perspectives,
et cetera.

89
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,140
That gives you the sense of three
dimensionality,

90
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,750
modern arts,
reduce that.

91
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,930
Why not accept the fact that we work on
a flat surface and let's do the most we

92
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,550
can with a flat surface and bring out
new stuff.

93
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,950
And what they're driving at though as
you it in the book,

94
00:05:57,951 --> 00:06:01,490
and you quote a number of these artists,
but they seem to be driving at most of

95
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:06,491
them is trying to get a more immediate
experience of the sublime but,

96
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,250
but not to demystify it in any way and
that I wonder whether that's sort of the

97
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:15,530
heart of this cultural divide sometimes
between the arts,

98
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,930
the humanities and the sciences that you
know,

99
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:21,820
science seeks to demystify.
Whereas the,

100
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,350
the arts at least I don't know that they
do.

101
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,550
I don't,
I don't know that they're using

102
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:25,970
reduction

103
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,590
and as well.
I think you're absolutely right.

104
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:31,850
I don't think the artists tries to
demystify that is not the purpose of

105
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:34,940
reduction.
The purpose of reduction is to increase

106
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:37,790
the mystery.
I mean one of the wonderful things about

107
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:41,240
abstract painting,
if we look at a de Kooning of we look at

108
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:46,241
a Jackson pollock is because the
information is often ambiguous.

109
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,840
It forces us to fill in the detail,
and I described this in the book in

110
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:56,990
terms of top down processing.
We rely on our free association,

111
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:59,570
our memory,
our previous experience to fill in the

112
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:03,230
detail of ambiguity.
And that means that you recruit the

113
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:06,230
beholder,
the participant in the creative act.

114
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,640
This actually goes back to Alice Rigo
and took umbrage and turns.

115
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:13,340
Chris,
who pointed out that when you and I look

116
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:15,800
at the same painting,
we see it somewhat differently.

117
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,963
What does that mean?

118
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,360
That each of us is recreating in our own
brain?

119
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:25,630
The image that we are looking at that is
the beholder undergoes in a very modest

120
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:29,510
way,
a creative experience that parallels in

121
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:34,190
a very modest way the creativity of the
artist.

122
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,530
And why is that interesting?
I don't know whether you've had that

123
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:40,010
experience,
but certainly I find when I have the

124
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:43,850
most modest creative idea,
it gives me a great deal of pleasure.

125
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:49,150
And I think one of the things that is so
pleasurable about abstract off for those

126
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:54,110
people who respond to it is that it
gives you lots of room for your own

127
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,944
creativity.

128
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,360
So now what's interesting though,
with these abstract painters,

129
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,140
and not all the painters that you
described in the book are abstract.

130
00:08:02,141 --> 00:08:03,250
I mean,
chuck close,

131
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,920
you use this abstraction to build up,
you know,

132
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:09,010
portraits.
But is that in a way they're,

133
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:14,011
they seem to be seeding some of the,
some of the control of the artist over

134
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:19,450
to the,
the beholders share like increasingly by

135
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:21,150
saying absolutely.
Right,

136
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,860
right.
The share is,

137
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:28,070
has a more prominent feature in abstract
art than it hasn't figured of art.

138
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:33,830
And this is one reason why some people
don't like abstract on too much work for

139
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:36,960
them,
but other people who enjoy this get a

140
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:38,310
lot of satisfaction out of it.

141
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,920
I guess where I was going with that is
that it seems an unusual move for an

142
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,070
artist,
like our stereotype of artists is that

143
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:50,770
they can be somewhat of control freaks,
you know,

144
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:55,710
wanting total control over the process
and over how the thing is perceived.

145
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:56,040
I think

146
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,560
that's definitely true of writers to
some extent,

147
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,730
but for them to make this move of,
you know,

148
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,350
giving more and more over to the viewer
is an interesting move.

149
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,300
I get your point and you're 100% right.
It is only one dimension of it.

150
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,070
I think they all control freaks.
I think that pollock and de Kooning are

151
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:16,800
perfectionist.
And you're the,

152
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:21,480
I discussed this one painting that
Rosenberg who it was a superior,

153
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:22,490
I guess,
professorship here.

154
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,710
Columbia came to visit him and saw this
and said,

155
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:28,350
you know,
this is a wonderful petty at decoding,

156
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:31,800
didn't want to release the painting,
didn't think it was ready to go cause

157
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:33,840
he,
you still felt he could approve it and

158
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:36,270
he told him this is a masterpiece.
Get it out right now.

159
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,180
So I mean they are very much control
freaks,

160
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,710
but they control freaks in the way they
control Mba and they're controlling,

161
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:47,070
I guess their own sort of their own
experience,

162
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,360
their own,
right.

163
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,061
Right,
right,

164
00:09:49,061 --> 00:09:50,160
right.
Then and then it's,

165
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:51,300
then it's up to the viewer.

166
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,630
That's,
that's interesting.

167
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,610
Okay.
Um,

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,290
well I think that might be a good moment
for us to transition into the,

169
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,970
uh,
the second part of this.

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,890
Yes.
This is,

171
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,080
uh,
this first one is Jan 11,

172
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,260
who's an astrophysicist and the video is
called three visionary scientists who

173
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:14,200
embraced limitations to have creative
outbursts.

174
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,320
I became interested in this phenomenon
of constraints,

175
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:31,141
inspiring creative outbursts.
And if you look at the last century,

176
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,930
there were three really profound
examples of that.

177
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:38,950
I would say the earliest that I found
incredibly interesting was the limit of

178
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:43,951
the speed of light leading Einstein to
the theory of relativity where a lot of

179
00:10:44,531 --> 00:10:47,860
other scientists wanted to remove the
limit.

180
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,320
They want it to say there is no limit to
the speed of light.

181
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:52,510
That doesn't make any sense.
That's impossible.

182
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,810
Einstein actually,
despite the word relativity,

183
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,040
adhere to a very strict absolute,
and that absolute was the speed of

184
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,980
light.
He took that to be his guiding

185
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:06,640
constraint and by sticking to it
rigidly,

186
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,340
he said,
I'll give up anything else but the speed

187
00:11:09,341 --> 00:11:11,650
of light.
And by doing so,

188
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,860
he gave up on the absolute nature of
space and time.

189
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,660
So I mean that's just much harder to let
go of intuitively,

190
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,840
but it was right,

191
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:21,843
right.

192
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,760
So she's talking about embracing
limitation,

193
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,330
like how limitation can actually push
science forward.

194
00:11:32,331 --> 00:11:35,240
Have you found that to be true in your
own work?

195
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,831
Well,
I mean,

196
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:35,950
yeah,

197
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,450
in a sense it isn't quite a reductionist
approach,

198
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:44,160
but it's focusing on one thing to the
exclusion of others in a sense.

199
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,740
And certainly if you look at the history
of go beyond mammies,

200
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:53,350
do I take a larger problem?
If you look at the explosion and

201
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:58,351
understanding the biology of life that
came with the discovery of genes by

202
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,260
Mendel and then later on,
but Thomas and Morgan realizing that

203
00:12:04,261 --> 00:12:08,050
genes are on chromosomes and then the
discovery,

204
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,240
the jeans are made out of DNA than a
fabulous watson crick discovery about

205
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:18,241
the structure of DNA of the gene.
I mean these are all focusing on the

206
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:21,580
gene to exclusion of carbohydrate
metabolism,

207
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:23,110
lipid metabolism,
everything else.

208
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,700
Those are secondary processes that
derive from genetic control of cellular

209
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:30,040
processes.
So I think in a sense,

210
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,760
this is not a universal strategy,
but a common strategy.

211
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,810
Often there are major variables that if
you understand them,

212
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,670
other things will follow more readily.

213
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,280
I guess it was a Karl Popper,
I think it was,

214
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:46,250
um,
the WHO spoke about paradigm shifts and

215
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:51,251
how essentially science proceeds by
people laboring in specific trenches for

216
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,790
long periods of time.
And then either you have a visionary who

217
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,950
breaks things open or,
or,

218
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,880
or those limitations of focus end up
leading to breakthroughs.

219
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,240
[inaudible] pump has been very important
in my field.

220
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,190
Uh,
in the following way,

221
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,520
a cop,
Papa felt you can't prove anything in

222
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:13,040
science.
Where do you can do is disprove.

223
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,810
And that turned out to be a very
important historical insights.

224
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,540
Uh,
there was a guy by the name of Jack

225
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,020
Eccles who was a major,
major person in my field and major

226
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:28,070
student of synaptic transmission.
And he thought synaptic transmission

227
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,790
between nerve cells was mostly
electrical.

228
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,800
And with time it became clearer and
clearer that this was likely to be

229
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:40,640
wrong.
And echoes became despondent at that

230
00:13:40,641 --> 00:13:41,474
time,
I think.

231
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,030
I think he was in Australia,
I forget where he was,

232
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:48,170
but he went to the faculty club and he
bumped into popper and they became

233
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:50,750
friends and he explained to him why he
was depressed.

234
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,820
And Papa said,
that's ridiculous.

235
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,790
You can't ever prove anything.
All you can do is to disprove it,

236
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,820
go back into the lab and disprove
yourself,

237
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,820
show that you were wrong,
that it's not electrical,

238
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,760
that it must be chemical.
And that's exactly what he did,

239
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,830
I guess.
Yeah.

240
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:10,670
I guess I would be interested in hearing
kind of as an adjunct to this,

241
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:13,760
what you know in,
in your field and the work that in the

242
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:17,420
work that you do on,
on memory and brain science,

243
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:22,630
what are the intractable problems right
now that people are finding themselves

244
00:14:22,671 --> 00:14:25,070
bumping up against that if they could
solve them,

245
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,750
it would be a major,
you know,

246
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,730
move forward.
What seemed to be the new frontiers

247
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,080
right now for brain science?

248
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,450
We're trying to see,
for example,

249
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,530
what is responsible for the reliability
of memory on the one hand.

250
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,680
And it's extraordinary unreliability and
the other,

251
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,440
um,
you know,

252
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:46,150
often we have the feeling we remember
something when we don't write a well,

253
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,110
we misremember it.
Uh,

254
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:49,730
and this is why,
uh,

255
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,850
testimony in is so unreliable.
A single observer,

256
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:00,430
remembering an event has a finite and
not too small chance of being wrong,

257
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,300
not by being dishonest,
by just misperceiving misremembering,

258
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,640
right.
So memory is not,

259
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,010
you know,
stamping something into a book and you

260
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:13,430
never have to worry about it.
It's often modified as a result of

261
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:16,190
subsequent experiences without being
aware of it.

262
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,900
So trying to figure out what controls
that and how we can get a better idea

263
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:24,470
into the core of the memory process is a
very active part of the field.

264
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,440
That's interesting.
Do you think that that may have

265
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:28,460
something to do?

266
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,230
I mean,
from a cognitive standpoint that that

267
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:34,160
may have something to do with kind of
the pragmatics of memory?

268
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:36,680
Like what,
what it is that we actually need to

269
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:40,520
remember in order to survive versus what
we don't.

270
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:43,250
I mean that were,
I don't think it deals with the

271
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:46,760
pragmatics of memory.
I think it deals with the pragmatics of

272
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:48,170
the brain.
So,

273
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,930
um,
I remember this conversation for example

274
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:52,490
we're having right now,
uh,

275
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:56,960
and it's possible that I'm sitting down
one day listening to a similar

276
00:15:56,961 --> 00:16:00,860
conversation and I may confuse that
second conversation.

277
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,130
At a subsequent time as being part of
the first conversation,

278
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,400
you really,
the initial memory and you often bring

279
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:11,600
to bear on it some of the subsequent
experiences associated with the second

280
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,630
sitting,
not just the first possibly because

281
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,700
those things are being stored in us.
I mean,

282
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:20,360
I'm not asking you to speculate on
science that hasn't been done yet,

283
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:25,361
but possibly because those memories are
stored in similar areas and we're

284
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:27,830
conserving space or something.

285
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,620
They tried it and it can be activated in
different words.

286
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:35,330
And also when a memory is recalled,
particularly the first few times it

287
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:39,890
sensitive to disruption and distortion,
so those things can interfere with the

288
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:44,891
longterm fidelity of the memory storage.
How does that disruption or distortion

289
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,600
happen?
I mean like so when I'm recalling the

290
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:51,680
memory,
the first few times it be the disruption

291
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:54,470
is only in the sense that the memory is
fixed,

292
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:58,070
but the structures that fix it become
unglued for a second,

293
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,840
for short period of time.
So the memory if perturbed can be

294
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:04,460
altered.
So if something like,

295
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,590
so let me,
let me put it to you this way.

296
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,950
When you form a memory,
it's a short term.

297
00:17:08,951 --> 00:17:12,920
I mean it doesn't persist,
but if you train repeatedly,

298
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,030
you form a longterm memory and the
longterm it consists of growth of new

299
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:20,750
synaptic connections and those synaptic
connections require new protein

300
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:24,920
synthesis doing a certain critical
period that protein synthesis is

301
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:29,921
sensitive to disruption and you can lose
the growth of new synaptic connections

302
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:34,070
despite the fact that they've occurred
because the synthesis is not ongoing

303
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,980
after,
while that no longer happens,

304
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,890
but in the early stages of longterm
memory storage,

305
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,420
it's susceptible to disruption and
disruption can come from like other

306
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:47,390
memories or ambient things happening
around you,

307
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:48,660
other experiences of the men.

308
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,950
Right.
Interesting.

309
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,930
Interesting.
Okay.

310
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,970
Well I think,
I think on that note,

311
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:54,804
let's,
uh,

312
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,760
let's move on to the second surprise
clip.

313
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:02,210
This is Harvard psychologist Susan David
on the psychology of defeating fear,

314
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,690
low self esteem and hate live in the
mind

315
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,530
when we have politicians who are
effectively demagogues,

316
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,920
who are inspiring fear in us,
that fear leads to very particular and

317
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,780
relatively predictable responses.
When we off fearful there is this idea

318
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:36,111
in psychological research of mortality
salience that when our mortality is

319
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:39,450
threatened,
when someone says,

320
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,510
Oh,
this group of people is out to get you

321
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,740
and we feel that we are actively being
threatened,

322
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:52,310
we are more likely to stereotype,
we are more likely to respond to

323
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,200
messages that we hear time and time
again,

324
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,590
even if they are against our values as
somehow making sense to us.

325
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,730
How do we protect ourselves against
this?

326
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,750
Daniel Conaman describes system one
thinking and system two thinking system.

327
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:20,241
One thinking is the intuitive response
that can sometimes arise out of fear

328
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,990
system two is the deliberate thoughtful
examination of what is this person's

329
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:31,740
saying?
Is it aligned with how I really want to

330
00:19:31,741 --> 00:19:36,230
be?
When we are able to step back from our

331
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:39,150
fear,
we are able to come to a place where we

332
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:43,620
are ultimately protected from the
demagoguery message.

333
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,840
Okay,
so we're talking about demagoguery and

334
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:55,010
fear and a,
I guess an immediate point of reference

335
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,390
in America in 2016 leaps to all of our
minds immediately.

336
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:04,450
Yes,
I have have really your experiences like

337
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:05,301
this.
Oh,

338
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:06,920
I would like to hear about that.
Yes.

339
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,800
I'm

340
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,650
Jewish and I was born in Vienna,
Austria,

341
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,350
and Myrna was nine years old,
right?

342
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Hitler marched into Austria and was
received by the Viennese in Vienna where

343
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:24,270
I was living with open arms and
immediately people who have been our

344
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:28,020
friends turned away from us and
essentially became our enemies.

345
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,320
And that's because Hitler had fantastic
antisemitic propaganda and he got this

346
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:39,951
propaganda in pod from an earlier
Vinnie's Hitler was in Vienna in 1906

347
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:47,271
1910 and the mayor of Vienna at that
time was a guy called Carl Louie Vega,

348
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,950
and Lucas was a terrific orator,
a tremendous campaigner.

349
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,960
He wasn't even all that antisemitic.
He had Jewish friends.

350
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:00,790
He would say,
I determine who was a Jew,

351
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:05,200
but he had a fantastic way of saying the
reason you don't have any money is

352
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:07,360
because the Jews are taking it away from
you.

353
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,090
It scared the hell out of people,
particularly those that didn't have

354
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:12,760
jobs,
convincing them that the Jews,

355
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:15,640
by charging high prices,
by creating works of art,

356
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:16,820
that expensive,
et cetera.

357
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,490
Dot.
God knows how many reasons we're

358
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:22,960
destroying the quality of their life.
So He created this environment of fear

359
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,230
to which people respond to that.
Hitler wrote in my comp,

360
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,620
I learned more from low how to run a
campaign than anybody else.

361
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,600
And fear is of course the traditional
way in which people pilled up opposition

362
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:36,730
to one force in order to get support for
another.

363
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,030
And it ate.
I found it very hard for the longest

364
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:42,850
time to understand how people can listen
to Haydn,

365
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:45,640
Mozart and Beethoven one day and beat up
the juice the next.

366
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,460
Um,
I,

367
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:51,940
I wonder what that did you know,
for you to you in terms of your thinking

368
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:56,941
about humans at that early age to see
that transition happen almost overnight.

369
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,330
Like do you,
do you have conscious memories of,

370
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:02,650
of that?
Of course.

371
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,880
Yeah,
absolutely.

372
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,620
My brother had built this short wave
radio set and we were listening to it as

373
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:12,160
Hitler unwatched and to Vienna and then
held them plots.

374
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,790
200,000 people came out and cheered him
like mad.

375
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,800
No,
it dominated the scene.

376
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,930
I walked the streets two days later and
a classmate of mine came up to me and

377
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:22,764
said,
candle,

378
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,420
I'm never to speak to you again.
That was horrible.

379
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,410
Uh,
and,

380
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,630
and they,
you ask yourself the question,

381
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:32,110
what is it that separates the good guys
from the bad guys?

382
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,990
And you come to the conclusion,
I think the current campaign in the

383
00:22:34,991 --> 00:22:39,991
United States illustrates that,
that every one of us is capable of good

384
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,930
and evil.
Reinhold Niebuhr once said,

385
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:49,000
the capability of people for good makes
democracy desirable.

386
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,150
That capability for evil mixed democracy
necessary.

387
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,620
That's well said.
And I recently read a book called

388
00:22:56,621 --> 00:23:01,621
machete season and it was about what
happened in Rwanda and it was primarily

389
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:07,120
based on interviews with these people
who had been just,

390
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:08,380
you know,
workers,

391
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:12,910
ordinary people living in Rwanda who
then became the kind of soldiers of this

392
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:17,170
campaign,
this massacre against their tribal

393
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,620
enemies.
And just this sort of mundanity of the

394
00:23:20,621 --> 00:23:25,150
way in which they described going out
every day to hunt other people.

395
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,940
It was extraordinary.
Yup.

396
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:27,850
Yup.
Absolutely.

397
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,480
Hannah Arendt called this the banality
of evil.

398
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,703
Well,
let's a little bit,

399
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,010
I mean,
I was very irritated with her use of

400
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:38,200
that.
This was an ice man and Jerusalem,

401
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,570
um,
evil is not for now.

402
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,200
And many of the people,
particularly in [inaudible] case,

403
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,050
he was a major force.
He was not a follower.

404
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,490
He was a leader.
Uh,

405
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,740
but he was able to bring many people
along.

406
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,561
No,
that's right.

407
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,690
That's right.
There are those people at the top who

408
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:57,800
are very conscious and calculating yes.
And aware of what they're doing.

409
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,690
I mean,
I don't know.

410
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:00,441
I can't,
you know,

411
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:02,510
I'm not a psychologist,
but I,

412
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:04,790
so I can't say whether it,
Donald Trump is,

413
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,770
you know,
personally aware or conscious enough of

414
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:12,410
what he's doing to be considered truly
evil.

415
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,670
But,
uh,

416
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,760
with his followers,
you want to look at it and you want to

417
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:18,830
say,
these people are crazy.

418
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:22,820
These people are stupid.
But obviously that's not the case for

419
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:24,230
all of them.
Obviously.

420
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,490
Obviously our brains are vulnerable to
this kind of manipulation.

421
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,270
I think this is worth the trump movement
is shown,

422
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:37,271
is you would never think that a movement
like this could succeed in the United

423
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,490
States.
And it's amazing how far it has gone,

424
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:44,180
although it is clearly fading.
And that is that there were people who

425
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:48,650
were dissatisfied with certain aspects
of our lifestyle to whom he appeals.

426
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,890
And he does it by phobia of strangers,
you know,

427
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,900
preventing people from coming into the
country,

428
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,851
et Cetera,
et Cetera,

429
00:24:54,851 --> 00:24:56,260
et cetera.
Do you have any thought,

430
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:59,050
do you have any thoughts or insights
from your vantage point?

431
00:24:59,051 --> 00:25:00,910
I mean,
of having experienced what you did as a

432
00:25:00,911 --> 00:25:04,030
kid and seeing this happening in America
and now,

433
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,320
uh,
into sort of what would be a better way

434
00:25:08,321 --> 00:25:11,530
to engage the people that are following
trump now?

435
00:25:11,531 --> 00:25:13,660
Like what is America not doing?
I mean,

436
00:25:13,661 --> 00:25:15,550
I know you're not trying to run the
country,

437
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:16,630
but I'd be

438
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,020
sure I can.
I mean,

439
00:25:18,021 --> 00:25:20,900
I'm so startled by the success.
Um,

440
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:26,110
I think the case could be stronger and
we'll be stronger if hilary ran a

441
00:25:27,741 --> 00:25:31,910
campaign a little bit better.
And if she had run her life a little bit

442
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:32,960
better.
I mean,

443
00:25:32,961 --> 00:25:36,740
you know,
she realized that she's interested in

444
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:41,060
public office and I think the whole
email thing could have been completely

445
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:46,061
finesse more over this accepting large
sums of money from companies for giving

446
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:51,590
lectures when she's going to run for
public office and realize the question

447
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:55,430
is going to rise is she gets a half a
million dollars or whatever she did for

448
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,040
a lecture.
Is she gonna feel beholden to those

449
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,270
people?
You would?

450
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,710
You would think so.
I mean,

451
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:04,400
you and I of course would never be with
some of the only guys that are half $1

452
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,410
million,
but Hillary Clinton who had does one no.

453
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,100
Yeah.
I mean it's a it that's right.

454
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:11,670
I mean,
even if she is somehow immune from to

455
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:14,520
their influences,
it's hard to preserve the illusion of

456
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:16,740
neutrality.
I think it's essential.

457
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,340
Yeah.

458
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:22,260
I think she made mistakes and I think
one of the reasons trump is more

459
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:24,710
successful than it might've been is that
Hillary,

460
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:28,170
although I much prefer her,
and I think she would probably make a

461
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:29,840
very good precedent,
um,

462
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,620
did not handle herself in her public
life in an ideal fashion.

463
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,220
She did not handle herself the way Obama
has handled himself,

464
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,800
which I think is extraordinary.
Sure.

465
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,350
But I,
at the same time,

466
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:46,620
there just seems be so much anger,
so much fear here.

467
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:48,540
And like I,
it's hard for me to believe that trump

468
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,400
just instilled that in everybody.
I mean,

469
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:55,350
obviously there were large numbers of
people concerned about immigrants taking

470
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:57,030
their jobs and you know,
that,

471
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:58,020
that have these,
well,

472
00:26:58,021 --> 00:27:00,570
I mean,
did you know our country is not perfect.

473
00:27:00,571 --> 00:27:05,571
If you look at the number of people who
have billions and see where taxes they

474
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:10,590
pay compared to people earning 40,
$50,000 or $80,000,

475
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,581
uh,
it's,

476
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:13,200
it's amazing.
You know,

477
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:15,720
there were problems in this country.
Do I complain?

478
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:18,960
Not too seriously.
I think this is heaven on earth.

479
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,000
I've had a wonderful life here.
Yeah.

480
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:21,481
Well,
I mean,

481
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:24,270
I'd like,
I'd like it to remain so for coming

482
00:27:24,271 --> 00:27:27,900
generations.
So hopefully we can avoid trump getting

483
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:32,330
elected or any repeat thereof because it
just doesn't bode well for,

484
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,990
for our future.
Yeah.

485
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,680
Yup.
Yup.

486
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,810
I made,
ended up the price of democracy is

487
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:38,670
constant vigilance.
I mean,

488
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:40,050
I'm repeating cliches,
but,

489
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,621
right,
right,

490
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:41,100
right,
right.

491
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh,
but this is true.

492
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,120
All right,
so let's move on to the third and final

493
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:46,950
video.
Yeah.

494
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:51,240
This is George Muster on the strangeness
of Physics and Telepathy.

495
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:00,580
The whole progress of physics is to
start with our everyday experience and

496
00:28:00,581 --> 00:28:04,150
to analyze it and look at it and look
for deviations from it.

497
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,230
So the very nature of action,
really all the natural sciences,

498
00:28:08,231 --> 00:28:12,160
but certainly a physics is to really get
away from our experience.

499
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:16,450
So the things physics comes up with are
just kind of a weird sub atomic

500
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:18,700
particles.
We can't see them directly at least,

501
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,580
but we know they're there.
We can actually do thought experiments

502
00:28:21,581 --> 00:28:24,340
about the things we do see and deduce
their existence.

503
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,090
So already,
even with just that limited an example,

504
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:33,040
we've gone intra beyond our direct
experience in a hundred years ago or so,

505
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:37,510
people doubted the existence of atoms,
a lot of loan sub atomic particles,

506
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,080
nonlocality spooky action at a distance
is very much in that,

507
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,960
in that mold.
It's taking this yet further away from

508
00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:47,020
our experience and therefore we expect
it to be weird.

509
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,880
It shouldn't be weird.
That's why physics is flooded.

510
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,860
And as other scientists have said,
you would expect it.

511
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:55,630
In fact,
if the theory isn't weird,

512
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,960
you kind of doubt it cause you worry
that your own biases are intruding into

513
00:29:01,961 --> 00:29:05,050
the,
into the theory and causing you to think

514
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:09,370
the world is a certain way when you're
not listening to the way the world

515
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:13,030
actually is.
So weirdnesses in a sense a test of a

516
00:29:13,031 --> 00:29:13,864
theory.

517
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,990
I mean I do,
I blog actually,

518
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,120
but not completely agree with it.
Uh,

519
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,250
I don't think physics necessarily has to
be weird and did weirdness.

520
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,510
Sydney's not a test of the reliability
of it

521
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,663
theory,

522
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:35,550
but certainly it deals with phenomenon
that we do not intuitively think about

523
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,460
all the time or at least people outside
of physics.

524
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,440
I'm thinking about it.
And it deals with many that are

525
00:29:41,441 --> 00:29:43,030
invisible,
have to be inferred.

526
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,210
And some day biology will reach that
level.

527
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:48,220
At the moment,
that's not the case.

528
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,650
Uh,
biology doesn't that all deal with

529
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:52,900
things that are weird?
I mean it's some weird things come out

530
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:55,180
of it,
but he tries to explain,

531
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,380
you know,
living processes that make intuitive

532
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:02,620
sense and we want to understand them in
a more profound when you can you say

533
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:05,140
more about what you mean by Sunday
biology make,

534
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:06,150
make out there.
Why,

535
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:07,420
why would that happen?
Well,

536
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:11,500
I think we probably want to understand
things on a deeper level right now.

537
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:14,230
If we understand that the level of of
molecules,

538
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,540
we think we're making a great deal of
progress,

539
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,630
but we may want to make it,
you know,

540
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,990
on an even more profound level on the
level of electron movement or something

541
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:23,824
like that.

542
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,100
We seen this all the time.
As a matter of fact take theory,

543
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,160
which has such an important role in
physics.

544
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:34,090
It didn't have an important role in
biology for the longest time.

545
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,120
Um,
when I came along there was a fair

546
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:39,850
amount of theory going on,
but it was mostly Malarkey,

547
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,620
right?
Because you can make a theory about

548
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:44,070
anything.
You want to have a theory about memory.

549
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,390
I give you a five tiers of our memory.
You know,

550
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,750
people were coming up with theories,
but they were not testing them.

551
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,890
Right?
This is changed.

552
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:53,260
Now.
Series had a major comeback in the last

553
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:56,740
15 years.
This was true for a long time in physics

554
00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:57,401
as well,
right?

555
00:30:57,401 --> 00:31:00,820
I mean they had all these theories that
they weren't able to test without the

556
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,370
particle reactors and so on.
And so,

557
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,130
so from the standpoint of lay people,
it was like,

558
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:08,520
what on earth are they talking about?

559
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,370
It's true,
but,

560
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,350
but,
but in brain science it was a little bit

561
00:31:11,351 --> 00:31:14,620
different because they could test it,
but they didn't think of doing it.

562
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,890
They didn't think it was necessary.
I see.

563
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,480
To test the theory,
but the fact is we can develop a theory

564
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:23,140
for anything unless you say,
now this is a prediction.

565
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,870
Let's run an experiment to test that
prediction,

566
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,660
which is what's going on right now.
It does brand science.

567
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:33,250
You talked a little bit about your book
in your book about how brain science and

568
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:36,720
psychology have somewhat merged in.
Oh,

569
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,760
that Ronnie has impact on one another.
And again,

570
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,670
again,
this is an area in which,

571
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,220
um,
people outside of psychology,

572
00:31:45,221 --> 00:31:48,340
even in the early stages,
psychologists thought that these

573
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,240
primitive guys from brain science,
when I eat us up,

574
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,820
they want to swallow the fear.
And that's not,

575
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:59,970
you cannot do biology of the mind
without being a psychologist.

576
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,810
I mean psychologist described many of
the obvious central phenomenon,

577
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,290
a classical conditioning perception
sensation.

578
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:12,670
All of these things were studied in very
reliable ways in psychophysical terms.

579
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:17,080
And we we now want to do is add the
biology to it and give it a new depth

580
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:21,370
and new level of understanding.
It's a beautiful case of coming

581
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:22,001
together.
In fact,

582
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:23,630
I would go further than this.
Uh,

583
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:28,690
I would say there had been a sequence of
mergers first it was a major between

584
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,870
cognitive psychology and brain biology,
sort of a new biology of mind.

585
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,800
But at the same time this was occurring,
it was watson and Crick and,

586
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,760
and all these people are coming along
developing molecular biology.

587
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,790
And so the approaches of molecular
biology,

588
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:48,380
cloning,
gene sequencing,

589
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:53,180
them figuring out their function through
mutations became applicable to the

590
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:56,240
brain.
So we can now test many of these ideas

591
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:59,210
with powerful molecular approaches.
Knock out this gene,

592
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:03,020
get rid of this particular protein.
So this put brain science and a

593
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:04,030
completely new level.

594
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,720
It's interesting,
I mean going back to the test case of

595
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:12,750
psychology and brain science though I,
that is kind of a beautiful model I

596
00:33:12,851 --> 00:33:17,680
suppose for the reconciliation of the
sciences and the humanities in a way

597
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:18,150
because,

598
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,070
well,
Secretary Collins,

599
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,250
you,
in all fairness,

600
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:25,320
by the time we got around to it was no
longer part of the humanities and

601
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,770
science as part of the management.
I mean it is a humanistic discipline,

602
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,260
but psychology at that time,
cognitive psychology was empirical out

603
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,900
laboratory tests,
experimental discipline.

604
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,250
Right,
right,

605
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:38,730
right,
right.

606
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,291
No,
I guess I'm,

607
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:43,710
I guess I'm thinking of like theory of
personality and I'll do something else.

608
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,040
The psychodynamics of it that still
soft.

609
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:47,570
In fact,
I,

610
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,310
you know,
my,

611
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:51,540
I was interested in psychoanalysis.
I wanted to become an analyst at one

612
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:56,430
point and I'm glad I didn't go that
direction because psychoanalysis is

613
00:33:56,431 --> 00:34:00,660
dying and one of the reasons this dying
is it has not become empirical.

614
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,410
Right.
And yet we do have these

615
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,460
big questions,
you know about like about meaning

616
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:08,160
identity,
what it means to live a good and

617
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,030
authentic tic

618
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,410
life,
some of which are absolutely and,

619
00:34:11,411 --> 00:34:15,290
and you can ask him,
there was a guy called Aaron Beck who

620
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,370
developed cognitive behavioral
psychology.

621
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:18,560
I don't know whether you know this is
about it.

622
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,570
He was interested in testing one of
Freud's ideas.

623
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,710
Freud had the idea that people who are
depressed or angry,

624
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,170
they first express the anger toward
others.

625
00:34:28,171 --> 00:34:30,690
Then you feel guilty about this.
Then they internalize it,

626
00:34:30,691 --> 00:34:32,790
feel angry with themselves and that
caused the depression.

627
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,590
So Aaron Beck's what he would test this
and he would test it by using the royal

628
00:34:37,591 --> 00:34:39,420
road to the unconscious,
which is dreaming.

629
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,860
So listen to the dream life is with
depressed patients and did an all sound

630
00:34:43,861 --> 00:34:47,850
as if this was the problem with them.
What they all sounded like is that they

631
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:50,380
had a low image of themselves.
He,

632
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:54,240
this guy was a famous radio interviewer
and he thought of himself as being,

633
00:34:54,241 --> 00:34:55,290
you know,
so,

634
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:58,410
so a guy was very successful in
business,

635
00:34:58,411 --> 00:34:59,970
thought it was a failure at home.

636
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,410
The low image.
And as he began to address himself to

637
00:35:04,411 --> 00:35:06,450
this issue of low image saying,
you know,

638
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:07,980
why do you think you'd like this,
Joe?

639
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,500
Look,
your family really enjoys you and

640
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:14,160
appreciates you.
He began to alters behavior and

641
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:18,660
cognitive behavior therapy developed.
So what Aaron Beck did is to write a

642
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:21,510
cookbook so you and I could do the same
thing I see.

643
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,290
And he asked other people to do this and
they were able to get the same results.

644
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:28,530
And then he did a prayer call,
outcome studies with controls showing

645
00:35:28,531 --> 00:35:30,720
that mild and moderate depression,
uh,

646
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:33,420
significantly helped by cognitive
behavior therapy.

647
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,310
Severe,
not so much,

648
00:35:35,311 --> 00:35:38,160
but synergistic with,
we worked very well.

649
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:41,490
So you can take these concepts and make
them scientific.

650
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,190
It just hasn't happened by and large in
psychoanalysis.

651
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,300
We don't know if it works under what
circumstances and how it works.

652
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,670
And that's got to come if it's going to
survive at all.

653
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,160
Okay.
Well,

654
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:55,040
Eric,
handle it has been wonderful talking to

655
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:56,750
you today.
Thank you so much,

656
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,531
uh,
for,

657
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:00,950
for spending your time on this show.
This has been a lot of fun.

658
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:02,720
And,
and to our audience,

659
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:07,910
I would strongly recommend professor
Kendall's new book reductionism in art

660
00:36:07,911 --> 00:36:10,790
and brain science.
It is fascinating,

661
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,030
beautifully written.
The science has explained incredibly

662
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:19,031
clearly and it's full of gorgeous
reproductions of modern paintings.

663
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,220
Thank you so much for your time,
Professor Kendall.

664
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,370
Oh,
thank you for inviting me.

665
00:36:22,371 --> 00:36:23,780
This is very enjoyable for me.

666
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,260
Sit for this week's episode of think
again,

667
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:35,730
I've been talking lately on this show to
a lot of artists and writers and it's

668
00:36:35,731 --> 00:36:38,880
really refreshing to speak to a
scientist,

669
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:44,270
especially one who has lived through so
many of the major developments in the

670
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,230
past century in science and art and has
so much to say about them.

671
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:54,660
I hope you enjoyed that conversation as
much as I did and we have lots of

672
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:57,330
amazing things lined up this fall.
It's going to be a really,

673
00:36:57,331 --> 00:37:00,930
really interesting fall.
I'm going on a brief and much needed

674
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:03,780
vacation,
but the show will be here and I hope to

675
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:04,740
see you back here next week.
