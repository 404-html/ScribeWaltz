1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,180
In its origins.
A liberal education always had science

2
00:00:03,181 --> 00:00:07,890
in it though interestingly,
people studied science in ancient Greece

3
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:12,810
and Rome in the Middle Ages or until
very recently for precisely the opposite

4
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:15,150
reason that people are now told to study
it.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,110
We are now tells you should study it
because it's a practical skill that you

6
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:21,060
can use in the real world.
Well,

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,930
in ancient Greece,
the practical skills that got you jobs

8
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:29,790
and got your career where rhetoric and
oratory and a study of history and law

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,210
science was seen as a kind of abstract
quest for knowledge.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,540
The only reason you were doing it was
mental stimulation and yet for hundreds

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,560
and hundreds of years people studied
science really just to try to answer the

12
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:45,660
big questions.
There was no sense that it could be

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,070
applied in a way that was practical,
would provide you with a career.

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,210
That's a very modern conception of
science and so I think what's

15
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:57,750
interesting is that even then when we
thought science was useless,

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,690
we studied it used us in a practical
sense.

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,850
Today my argument will be yours.
Think about that length and breadth of

18
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:08,310
history.
When you say their English is useless.

19
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:13,200
Yale has opened a campus in Singapore
and what they've done is they've tried

20
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:16,080
to reimagine what a liberal education
would look like.

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,480
Uh,
and they've also tried to reimagine what

22
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:23,010
it would look like in a global context.
There is a core that for the first two

23
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:25,260
years there is a series of required
courses.

24
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,010
Uh,
but the requirements are more in method

25
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:34,011
of inquiry that is in critical thinking
rather than in a particular subject or a

26
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:37,380
particular set of books.
You Study Aristotle,

27
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,030
but at the same time you read Confucius
who was aristotle's contemporary and you

28
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:45,330
ask yourself,
why did aristotle have certain concerns

29
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:47,970
about politics?
But Confucius had others.

30
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,110
What explains this difference?
So the idea here would be to try to

31
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,350
understand that the west is not the only
thing in the world,

32
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:58,410
that there is a much broader universe
and you understand the differences and

33
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:02,280
similarities.
All these subjects have deep a long

34
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:05,970
traditions and feed various parts of the
human brain and the human soul.

35
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,040
And so recognize that what seems
fashionable when one Arrow will not seem

36
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:15,720
fashionable in another,
but they all together interact and

37
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:17,280
comprise a liberal education.
