1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,943
Hmm.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,940
That's an Obama administration has
brought about change.

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:15,270
I don't think that can be debated.
There is everything from the symbolic to

4
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,280
the substantive,
you know,

5
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:21,910
levels of what it would mean to have an
African American president.

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,010
And,
uh,

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,030
I think at the same time,
there have been changes that were

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,940
unanticipated,
that came as a consequence of his

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,840
presidency.
And so when we talk about

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,080
the initial moment of his launch,
uh,

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,200
into as a national political figure,
which was in that 2004 speech convention

12
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:49,150
speech in Boston,
uh,

13
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:50,980
he began that by saying,
you know,

14
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:55,420
there's not a black America or white
America or a Latino America,

15
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,430
but there's the United States of
America.

16
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,000
And you know,
that was entirely untrue.

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,960
You know,
they were vastly different realities

18
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:09,490
that very often corresponded to race,
or at least were significantly

19
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:12,460
correlated with race and ethnicity.
And so,

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,190
uh,
what we've seen over the course of his

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,280
two terms has been a
means by which our period in which it's

22
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,890
been increasingly visible.

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,870
You know,
the distinctions that we see,

24
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,520
um,
as citizens based upon these elements of

25
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:31,690
identity,
who we are.

26
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:32,524
And,
uh,

27
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,060
where we're from and what kind of
communities we live in.

28
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:37,780
And you know,
what are racial ethnic background is,

29
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,730
those things would come to the
foreground.

30
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,410
And I don't think that you could
possibly have anticipated the extent to

31
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:48,610
which they have done so.
And so when we look at,

32
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,980
you know,
black lives matter and how it emerged,

33
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,061
uh,
one,

34
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:56,270
it seemed kind of paradoxical that for,
you know,

35
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,110
half a century African Americans had
been struggling,

36
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,540
uh,
specifically around the voting rights

37
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:05,380
act to get increased political electoral
representation.

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,260
And at the point at which,
uh,

39
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,110
were represented at the pinnacle of
American political power,

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,530
it reverberates and this kind of a
boomerang effect.

41
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:18,880
And we wound up with a revitalized
grassroots movement of people who don't

42
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:21,580
necessarily trust political power,
people who are outside the

43
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:22,950
establishment,
uh,

44
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,830
and people who were attempting to kind
of move the levers of political power to

45
00:02:26,831 --> 00:02:30,010
the advantage of a disempowered
communities.

46
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,940
And one would have thought,
I guess in a kind of naive perspective

47
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:37,030
on Barack Obama's presidency,
you would have thought that those things

48
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,820
would not have been necessarily,
would not have been necessary.

49
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,940
Certainly some of his critics,
uh,

50
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,980
bought that he was going to govern in
such a radical way that,

51
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,720
uh,
it was going to be,

52
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,660
you know,
reparations handed out in the first week

53
00:02:49,661 --> 00:02:51,670
for African Americans.
Uh,

54
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,960
and he's been very moderate and centrist
and,

55
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,120
and often reluctant to directly engage
issues of race.

56
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,870
I think that's what some of frustration
who come from the younger generation of

57
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:03,050
activists,
uh,

58
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,520
and they took his moderation as being,
uh,

59
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,580
in some instances inadequate to the task
at hand.

60
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,750
I think that there's a lot that's
missing from the public conversation

61
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:16,150
about race.
When we talk about race,

62
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,800
we most often confronted as an emotional
reality,

63
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,560
uh,
or this kind of

64
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,280
subject of,
um,

65
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,190
social anxiety or something in which we
go,

66
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:34,090
oh,
you know,

67
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,120
we're really all the same and you know,
it's a ridiculous idea that we separate

68
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,960
ourselves in this way.

69
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,400
Uh,
which is true,

70
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:47,401
but it's also very facile way of
approaching that question because on a

71
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,910
more fundamental level,
race is a mythology.

72
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:55,750
But there's also a very useful myth.
And that's the only way it's been able

73
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:59,500
to endure for as long as it has,
particularly in the United States.

74
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,760
Uh,
and so,

75
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,650
uh,
what I mean by that is we look at things

76
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:08,680
now when we talk about race,
pretend to say that

77
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,300
no,
there's this level of mistrust or their

78
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,070
stereotypes or misunderstandings.
And you know,

79
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:20,160
we have these problems and we should all
just look at each other as humans.

80
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,640
But the fact of the matter is that
things like slavery and segregation and

81
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,960
economic discrimination,
these things happened willfully.

82
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,540
They weren't the result of a kind of
haphazard,

83
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,140
mistaken approaches to people who happen
to be different from you.

84
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,890
And so it means that we don't simply
have to dispel mythology.

85
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,330
It means we have to actually grapple
with people having concrete interests

86
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,470
that may be different than the interests
of other communities.

87
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,830
And so it's not simply implicit bias in
policing that has resulted in

88
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:03,690
disproportionate numbers as we saw in
Ferguson.

89
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,020
It wasn't simply a matter of implicit
bias or stereotypes,

90
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,010
or,
um,

91
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,600
good intentioned,
well intentioned individuals who

92
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,520
happened to have arrested or pulled over
more African Americans and whites.

93
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,680
We saw that there was an institutional
structural approach to particular

94
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:30,681
communities that were being fleeced by a
police department.

95
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,050
And so we can find those kinds of
dynamics again and again and again.

96
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:38,520
And so when we talk about race,
it's going to be much more intractable

97
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,810
than simply ridding ourselves of,
uh,

98
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,680
maybe some,
uh,

99
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,670
mistaken ideas that have rattled around
in our heads.

100
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,400
So sometime.
