1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,660
My name is Billy Collins
was born on West Thirtieth Street.

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,640
I should point out that there's a
difference between the need that was

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,320
autobiographically shaped

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,940
the persona that says my problems.
My persona has had.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,400
New York has,
had no influence on my persona.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,440
I'm,
well,

7
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:28,070
it's influenced me,
I suppose just that.

8
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:33,071
And I grew up in a fairly
cosmopolitan and crazy environment.

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,950
So,
uh,

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,700
I guess I'm not too easily impressed by
eccentricity for one thing since if you

11
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:45,150
walked down one block in Manhattan,
you see,

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,260
you know,
it's like going into

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,910
a lot of influences that young person.
Obviously the parents,

14
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,960
um,
probably my father for his sense of

15
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:59,550
humor.
He was a,

16
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:01,530
uh,
a joker.

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,670
He had a lot of formal jokes,
but he also had zingers.

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,700
Now these one liners that were,
had enough zinger for every occasion and

19
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:14,670
he was a very,
it was a practical joker as well.

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,940
I,
we don't have time to go into his

21
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,970
practical drugs perhaps,
but suffice it to say that the kind of

22
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:25,200
pranks he pulled on office workers,
he worked on Wall Street,

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,990
uh,
would today be a,

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,810
would qualify as psychological
harassment?

25
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,340
Uh,
in those days,

26
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:36,210
the practical joke still was,
I think on prosecutable,

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,760
um,
my mother for her basically for more

28
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:43,710
relevantly,
for interested in poetry.

29
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,990
Um,
she was,

30
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:47,970
both,
my parents were born in 1901.

31
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:50,910
And they lived well into their nineties,
both of them.

32
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,890
And,
um,

33
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,980
she was raised,
born and raised on a little farm in

34
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,870
Ontario,
Canada,

35
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,810
which is my big claim to ethnicity.

36
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,450
I'm half Canadian I guess.
And um,

37
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,090
but as a child she memorized a lots of
poetry and the,

38
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,290
that was the thing to do in those days.
Memorization was not thought of as old

39
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,560
hat or little red school house.
So as an adult,

40
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,000
uh,
uh,

41
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,660
she was a storehouse of poetry and could
produce a lines of poetry for a,

42
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:29,790
just as my father had zinger for every
occasion she would have a few lines of

43
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,180
poetry forever,
every,

44
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,990
every occasion.
So poetry was in the air,

45
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:35,970
it was in the,
it was in the house.

46
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,610
Um,
and I,

47
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,670
I was influenced by teachers of course.
Uh,

48
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,040
but one thing about ti about being
influenced by teachers,

49
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,640
I can remember in terms of my poetry
writing,

50
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,910
a number of teachers who,
uh,

51
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,600
who encouraged me to keep writing and
seeing like a innocent thing to do at

52
00:02:56,821 --> 00:03:00,880
the time and uh,
but the teachers I really remember

53
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:05,080
vividly a,
were the two or three teachers who were

54
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,260
very discouraging to me and very
dismissive of my poetry and uh,

55
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,740
we're quick to tell me that it was
nothing but a bunch of teenage hormonal

56
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,590
overdrive or overspill and they might've
been right and an aesthetic literary

57
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:24,220
critical sense.

58
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,780
Um,
but they really inspired me to keep

59
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:31,570
writing,
to prove them wrong.

60
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,910
And I think,
I mean,

61
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:38,911
I know I have a,
a much keener appetite for revenge than

62
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,510
I do for approval.
Um,

63
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,030
so the teachers that approved to me,
I approval never meant that much to me.

64
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:48,910
I think I got so much from my mother.
I didn't need outside approval.

65
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,540
But,
um,

66
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,430
if you discouraged me a,
that would get me going.

67
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:59,431
And when I got a phone call from the
Librarian of Congress in 2001 telling me

68
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:02,020
I was poet laureate of the United
States,

69
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,740
I thought of those teachers who
discouraged me and that added a little

70
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:09,070
bit of sugar.

71
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,440
No,

72
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,600
she's the mother of us all.
I mean,

73
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:20,140
those are the,
you know,

74
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,220
writing poetry or painting or dancing or
playing the trumpet a.

75
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:30,090
all of these activities that we consider
art,

76
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,960
for lack of a better name,
are really,

77
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:37,440
I think,
just extensions of natural childhood,

78
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,780
uh,
activities that childhood desires that

79
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:46,870
are enacted.
I mean,

80
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,840
as children,
we are painters,

81
00:04:48,841 --> 00:04:52,980
dancers.
Just give a kid a flute and he'll start

82
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:54,020
playing it.
Um,

83
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,490
and,
and writers,

84
00:04:56,491 --> 00:05:01,491
I mean all children love rhyme.
I think poets are artists who just are

85
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:06,711
just people who somehow didn't allow
that natural ability in childhood to be

86
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,550
killed off by bad teaching.
The self consciousness of adolescence

87
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:16,380
goes

88
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,000
down the drain.
