1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,450
None of us want a learning environment
where we feel threatened,

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,900
so for example,
I don't want to have to be learning in

3
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,760
an environment where there are people
with semi,

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,810
whatever you call them,
assault rifles around me,

5
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:20,700
right?
I don't want to be learning in an

6
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:24,870
environment where I have somebody who's
openly misogynistic and yelling,

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,520
misogynistic slurs at me all the time,
so all of us want safe spaces for

8
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:31,380
learning.
That's not unusual.

9
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:34,500
It's not a bad thing.
The question is where do we put the

10
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:38,970
borders on that and in some
circumstances in universities,

11
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:43,971
we've reached the point where we're so,
so dedicated to the idea of making sure

12
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:48,390
everybody feels absolutely comfortable
that we've shut down some people's

13
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:53,391
ability to speak and to think and to go
beyond where comfort zones may be and

14
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:59,490
that's where it becomes a real problem.
So it is not the case that universities

15
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:02,100
should be places where you feel
comfortable all the time.

16
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,710
Intellectually we're supposed to be
uncomfortable.

17
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:07,310
That's how we grow.
As one of my graduate school professors

18
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:09,810
said to me,
if you haven't changed your mind lately,

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,070
how do you know it's working?
And I thought that was a really good way

20
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:15,150
to think about it.
I was.

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,540
He said that to me when I was stuck in a
particular idea and I wasn't budging and

22
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:21,150
he thought I was being obstinate and I
was.

23
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,280
And I started thinking,
well,

24
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,290
maybe changing your mind isn't a bad
thing,

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,040
but what's happening on a lot of
university campuses has an ocean.

26
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:32,100
You come with your preexisting beliefs
about your identity,

27
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:34,500
about the world.
And no one's supposed to question that.

28
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,990
And I think that's very problematic.
You know,

29
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:38,190
for example,
people say,

30
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:39,780
well,
we don't want right wing people on

31
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:42,480
campus.
I knew I want everybody on campus.

32
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:45,150
I want everybody having the same
educational opportunities.

33
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,450
And I want the opportunity to actually
have real conversations about different

34
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:50,580
points of view.
Getting them out in the open,

35
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:53,670
airing,
them being able to have conversations,

36
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:55,140
arguments,
thinking about data,

37
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,960
thinking about evidence,
thinking about histories of justice.

38
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,100
It allows us to have those conversations
in a way that I think has integrity and

39
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:05,820
honesty and gets us somewhere.
So if people have the attitude,

40
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:07,440
you know,
some people are allowed on campus,

41
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:09,030
some people are not,
some people are allowed to speak,

42
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:12,460
some people are not,
that doesn't really get us forward and

43
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,450
certainly it is the case.
We should not allow people to openly

44
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:17,190
abuse each other verbally,
um,

45
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,590
in ways that are profound.
So for example,

46
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:23,520
using the n word for example,
but beyond that,

47
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:26,430
I think we have to have a lot of
generosity in terms of allowing people

48
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:30,180
to air ideas and giving everybody time
to do that so that we can have

49
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,220
meaningful education.

50
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,950
So there's over simplification of
history.

51
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:39,120
The sort of idea of everybody is good or
everybody is evil as opposed to there

52
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,000
are some people who are kind of nasty
but did some useful work.

53
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:44,190
There are some people are good but did
some terrible things.

54
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,520
Trying to inject some of that subtlety
and thinking historically thinking

55
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:50,880
empirically would be a heck of a lot
better than doing simplistic identity

56
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:55,881
politics where everybody gets devil
horns or an angel's halo and you account

57
00:02:56,941 --> 00:03:00,330
for that based on current ideas of who.
What's a good identity and what's a bad

58
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:02,730
identity.
It's not a good way to think of.
