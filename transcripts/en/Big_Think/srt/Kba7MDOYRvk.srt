1
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,750
All families,
all families have conflict,

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,340
successful families actually illimited
and move on to actually building

3
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,010
positive memories,
so how do you do that?

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,060
I took a three day course from the folks
at the Harvard negotiation project

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,990
thinking they work with Israelis and
Palestinians and general strikes in

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,170
emerging markets.
Let's find out what they know to bring

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,910
peace and this changed a lot about how
my wife and I,

8
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,630
we used to have what I call it,
7:40 to fight every night the kids would

9
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:45,570
be down and we would talk about who's
picking up the milk,

10
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:50,571
who's buying the tickets for vacation,
and it would always just ended a model

11
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:54,570
with my wife storming out of the room
and what I learned was a number of

12
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:55,470
things.
First of all,

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,320
I changed when we have these
conversations.

14
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,770
Highest stress time and families is
between six and eight at night,

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,480
so 7:42 PM.

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,760
The worst time you can have one of these
fights,

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,730
so we no longer have difficult
conversations during this period.

18
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,340
Second,
I changed where we fight.

19
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,460
I would be at my desk surrounded by my
computer equipment,

20
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:15,870
a pie.
My wife would be lower,

21
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:17,550
she'd be her arms crossed,
resentful.

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,840
Turns out I was in the power position,
so now when we have difficult

23
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:24,630
conversations,
we sit at the same level.

24
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,480
We actually,
if we're having a really difficult

25
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:29,550
conversation,
have moved to our bedroom,

26
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:34,410
to a bench that we have this cushion
because research shows if you're sitting

27
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:37,110
on a cushion bench will be more open
alongside each other.

28
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:39,270
You'll be collaborative across from each
other,

29
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,930
more confrontational.
The point is there's all these new ideas

30
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:47,010
out there about reducing conflict,
so let's bring them into families.

31
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,500
Some may be right for your family,
some may not,

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,520
but I'd be surprised if you couldn't
fight smarter after reading some of

33
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:54,990
these tips.
For example,

34
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,760
one thing,
worst thing you can say on a fight,

35
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,270
is it I is that we?
Is it you or is it your mother?

36
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,690
Your mother and I may not be great,
but you turned out to be the worst thing

37
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:05,610
you can say in a fight.
You always do this.

38
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:07,890
You'd never do that.
Speak about yourself.

39
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,760
Speak about us as a couple,
but if you want to stop fighting,

40
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,080
stop saying you.

41
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,490
So let's talk about things that can go
wrong in families.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,600
Even if the adults are fighting smarter.
The kids are probably getting into a lot

43
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:31,500
of disputes and they seem incredibly
petty to parents,

44
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,100
but the truth is even those petty
discussions and in my house,

45
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,510
it can be socks in your house.
It might be who's staying up later.

46
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,740
It might be who's getting to sit in what
chair?

47
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,340
So here's what I've learned is simple
three step process that can reduce

48
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:46,560
sibling fighting.
Number one,

49
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,200
separate them,
they're in the middle of the conflict.

50
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,050
Separate them.
Give everyone a chance to calm down and

51
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:55,290
reflect a little,
not only on what the other person did,

52
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,110
but on what they.
Step two,

53
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,810
and this is the most important,
have kids come up with two or three

54
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:04,630
alternatives.
Usually the first one is going to be the

55
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:07,450
one that they've come up with and they
may stick to that for a few minutes,

56
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,930
but after awhile they'll come up with
two or three alternatives.

57
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,210
Then you bring the siblings back
together.

58
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,460
At that point,
there's four or five alternatives on the

59
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:19,480
table and nine times out of 10,
one of those alternatives overlaps with

60
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:22,120
another and the kids are beginning to
solve the problem.

61
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,230
Again,
the key here is to give your kids the

62
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:29,620
tools that they need to solve the
problems themselves.

63
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,880
I used to think,
oh,

64
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,100
don't be referee.
Let the kids solve the problems,

65
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,020
but the truth is you need to teach them
the skills.

66
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:38,650
You can't just expect them to learn it.
Teach them the skills so they can solve

67
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,830
the problems.
When you're not.
