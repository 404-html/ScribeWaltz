1
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,630
The ethical dilemma I've always
struggled with in my career as a writer

2
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,523
is that,
um,

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,750
I tend to like the people that I write
about and I,

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,830
I believe it's my duty and job as a
writer to empathize with my subject.

5
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,360
Uh,
not to get too high flow Dostoyevsky's

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,360
said,
um,

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,820
it's very easy to condemn the evildoer.
Um,

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,520
but the challenge is to understand him
or her.

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,760
That's what I'm always trying to do.
Um,

10
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,400
and um,
I,

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,210
I sometimes end up favoring my subjects
too much.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,150
Um,
and then I have to be stern with myself

13
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:54,100
and say,
ethically it's my job to dig out the

14
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:56,770
nasty truths and to tell them as well.
So,

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,410
um,
that's what I tried to do.

16
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,710
I almost invariably fall out of favor
with the people I write about.

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,890
Um,
my first book on Saudi Arabia was

18
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:13,180
banned.
Um,

19
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,650
I am told this new book I've just
written on Saudi Arabia will be banned.

20
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,500
Um,
one of my most successful books,

21
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:23,740
I went to live in Detroit,
Michigan and wrote about the Ford

22
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:26,020
family.
And that was a wonderful experience to

23
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:29,680
sort of live in a big old grimey
American city.

24
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,100
Although I could send them mentally
afford to say that because I was going

25
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:36,280
to go away and I didn't have to live
with the problems of the rust belt.

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,580
Um,
I thought I painted a wonderfully

27
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,640
sympathetic portrait of the Ford family,
but they haven't spoken to me from that

28
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,040
day to this.
Um,

29
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,800
and I can live with that.
That's,

30
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,900
you know,
that's part of the,

31
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,410
the job of being a writer.
Um,

32
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,410
there's a falseness to it.
You know,

33
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,260
you,
you,

34
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,920
you meet someone,
you creator,

35
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,750
I'm,
you genuinely like them,

36
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,820
but there's an element of facsimile in
the friendship that you are creating

37
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:06,310
because it's going to end the moment.
Um,

38
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,610
the,
the interview is over and you have to

39
00:02:09,611 --> 00:02:10,444
under,
you know,

40
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,640
realistically,
um,

41
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,410
I interview people to get something out
of them and they give me interviews

42
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:19,600
because they want something out of me
weed.

43
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,530
And,
um,

44
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,350
does that bargain and compromise in,
in every transaction that a writer or

45
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,410
journalist charism.
