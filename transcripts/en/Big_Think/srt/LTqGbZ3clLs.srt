1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,160
Well,
the,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,160
um,
I was born in 1934 and the,

3
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:14,310
as you're right,
the depression was on a,

4
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:19,311
I think I am a,
I can legitimately consider myself a,

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,050
a,
a child of the depression and that,

6
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:24,120
uh,
nobody had anything.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,670
And so when you're not used to having
something,

8
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:29,700
when you do have something,
you appreciate it a lot more.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,030
Um,
and because everybody was in the same

10
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:35,970
boat,
there was also a kind of an affinity of,

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,190
of misery and,
uh,

12
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:40,260
and as a consequence,
there was no mystery.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,750
In other words,
if everybody's suffering the same way,

14
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,610
the same thing.
There was a kind of,

15
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,640
we're all in this together and I felt
that with my,

16
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,730
uh,
as a kid and I'm a.

17
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:53,810
and then World War Two came and I,
uh,

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,920
we lived in Kansas in Wichita,
Kansas where they built the b seventeens

19
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,440
and the [inaudible].
My mother in fact worked on the assembly

20
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:06,441
line of the b 29 as a wire cutter and
the Boeing plant in Wichita and a world

21
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:08,030
war two.

22
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,300
And we thought that the Japanese were
going to bomb us any moment because we

23
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:14,640
had the Boeing plant,
there was after Pearl Harbor.

24
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,590
But what,
what it,

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,180
what it did for me is,
uh,

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,660
uh,
the war was,

27
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:25,710
was a very present,
even though it was physically very,

28
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,140
very far away.
It was very much a part of our lives.

29
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,550
And,
uh,

30
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,530
my dad had been a,
a,

31
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,840
a moraine and the 19 twenties,
uh,

32
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,640
I decided right then and there that
someday I would grow up to be a marine

33
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,400
and so did my older brother.
And as a matter of fact,

34
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,040
that's what happened.
But it,

35
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,000
all that stuff kind of began there.
That,

36
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,510
that here again,
the World War II was similar in,

37
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,111
in,
uh,

38
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:51,540
uh,
to the depression and that there was a

39
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,470
togetherness about it.
And it wasn't a,

40
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,640
it wasn't him and her and they,
them.

41
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:59,460
And they was all of us at war.

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,010
All of us doing the best we could to,
uh,

43
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,070
uh,
to beat the bad guys and to protect

44
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:07,550
ourselves from the bad guys.
And,

45
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:08,670
um,
there was,

46
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:09,630
uh,
so I,

47
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,820
I think frankly,
um,

48
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,490
I am fortunate,
I know it sounds strange,

49
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,840
but I am fortunate that I did have the
depression and World War II and those

50
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,060
early years.
Um,

51
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,740
because it,
uh,

52
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,360
I,
I,

53
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,500
I never,
ever,

54
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,740
because of those two experiences,
a day to day experiences in both cases,

55
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:35,010
I have never ever been somebody who took
anything for granted because,

56
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,300
uh,
uh,

57
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,380
because I just,
it was part of my growing up and part of

58
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:45,360
my formation is who I am today.
I think that,

59
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:46,530
uh,
uh,

60
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:48,630
it all began with,
you know,

61
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,380
wondering where we were going to have
enough money to have dinner tonight.

62
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,210
Whether or not somebody's next to me or
some member of my family was going to

63
00:02:57,211 --> 00:03:00,430
die in a war.
It made everything.

64
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,400
It heightened everything,
heightened awareness,

65
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:07,390
heightened interest,
heightened intensity of life.

66
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,710
And I still feel that.
