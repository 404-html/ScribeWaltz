1
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,150
Well,
I think everything,

2
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,800
whether it's filmmaking,
photography,

3
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,630
music,
uh,

4
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,930
especially in electronic music 20 years
ago,

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,240
making electronic music was really
difficult.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,030
You know,
you had to have obscure pieces of

7
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:31,990
equipment and you had to figure out how
to make them all talk to each other.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,380
And so finding the equipment was
difficult.

9
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:39,100
Getting it to work was difficult.
And now everything exists on a laptop,

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,520
you know,
just like individual pieces of software

11
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,040
that do everything for you.
So on one hand,

12
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:48,670
I love that because it's very
egalitarian and the software worked

13
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:51,700
flawlessly and it sounds great and
anyone can use it.

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,930
But at the same time,
I mean,

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,890
we run the risk of everybody being an
artist,

16
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,550
which on one hand is great,
but it just means that if everyone's an

17
00:01:03,551 --> 00:01:06,640
artist who's ever going to stop and
listen to what other people are doing,

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,620
you know,
if everybody's making music,

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,620
then everyone's just clamoring to get
their music listened to,

20
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,990
which might not be such a bad thing.

21
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,740
But
my website,

22
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:23,741
[inaudible] dot com started in I think
1999 99 or 2000 and it started just as a

23
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:27,770
way of making people aware of upcoming
shows.

24
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:29,870
And it sort of evolved into a lot more
than that,

25
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,440
especially as bandwidth increased.
For me.

26
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:38,270
The website is just a fun way of
communicating directly with people.

27
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,670
You know,
in the old days the only way you could

28
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:44,480
communicate with an audience member was
through like,

29
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,670
you know,
different media outlets or through the

30
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:49,490
gatekeepers at the record company.
And now I can communicate very directly.

31
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,890
And I also just recently started a
website called [inaudible] dot com that

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,180
takes music that I've made and gives it
away for free to independent filmmakers

33
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,770
and film students.
Uh,

34
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,940
and that goes through moby.com as well.
I started moby gradis.com cause a lot of

35
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:09,200
my friends who are independent
filmmakers are film students complained

36
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,650
that the hardest part about making a
film is actually trying to license

37
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:13,820
music.
You know,

38
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:16,550
cause they don't have budgets.
And so the record companies don't return

39
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:18,260
their calls.
The publishing companies don't return

40
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,240
their calls.
So I started [inaudible] as a way to

41
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:24,320
just give free music to my friends who
are independent film makers.

42
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,340
And the response from that community,
the independent film community has been

43
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:31,010
great.
And we've had about 8,000 uses so far.

44
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:31,844
You know,
it's been using,

45
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,460
well not 8,000 different films,
but 8,000 different uses.

46
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:36,140
So,
and we've only,

47
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:38,540
thus far,
for the most part,

48
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,090
publicized it to people in the
independent film.

49
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,230
Okay.
