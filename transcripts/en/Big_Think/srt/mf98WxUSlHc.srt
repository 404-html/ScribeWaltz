1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,360
Unmanned aerial vehicle project at x,
which we call wing houses.

2
00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:15,481
It's aspiration to remove the bulk of
the remaining friction from how we move

3
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,330
physical things around in the physical
world,

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,900
particularly the so called last mile
problem.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,130
If you look at the history of how
physical things have been moved around

6
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:31,930
in the physical world,
every time a chunk of the remaining

7
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:35,560
friction was removed from that process,
boats,

8
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,930
planes,
trains,

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,290
the automobile,
the Pony Express,

10
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,130
the mail system.
Every one of these things.

11
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:50,131
As we got more organized and removed
cost and complexity from how physical

12
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:55,060
things got moved around in the world,
the world became so different that it

13
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:59,380
was impossible beforehand to even
predict how different and how much

14
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:02,020
better it would be.
On the other side of that introduction,

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,280
we take for granted the remaining
friction as though it's natural and will

16
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:12,520
continue forever.
If you could have anything that would

17
00:01:12,521 --> 00:01:17,290
fit in a breadbox brought to you within
one or two minutes,

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,290
you still have to pay for the thing
that's in the bread box,

19
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,320
but it could be brought to you nearly
for free.

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,370
Then our world would be radically
different.

21
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,850
Those batteries that are sitting in a
drawer in your house or apartment right

22
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:36,070
now,
discharging you have those batteries.

23
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:41,190
You're wasting the planet because you
think you might need a few of those

24
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:45,940
batteries before they fully discharge on
some Christmas morning or something.

25
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,700
But if you believed you could have any
battery,

26
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,000
any shaped a battery you want just in
the moment you need it,

27
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,640
you wouldn't bother holding all those
batteries.

28
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,420
You probably have a hammer in your house
or apartment.

29
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,310
Why do you have that hammer?
You almost never use it and we all have

30
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:06,940
to have a hammer for the occasional
moment when we want the hammer,

31
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,720
but we could probably share one hammer
around 10,000 of us.

32
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,530
Think how much richer the world would be
if we could have that.

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,200
How are we going to make it so that you
could have the hammer just appear within

34
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:22,660
a moment or two when you want it.

35
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,160
You say,
I want to hammer you,

36
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:28,390
get a cup of coffee at the most and the
hammers there and our proposal for how

37
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:33,391
to do that is that you can make small
vehicles that fly through the air

38
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,650
quietly and very safely and bring to you
whatever you want.

39
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,790
Our prediction is that at first society
will adopt these for the use of

40
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:48,550
delivering food.
Food is something that almost everybody

41
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:51,850
uses and that they use on a very regular
basis.

42
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,330
There's already a a very robust food
delivery market and people express an

43
00:02:57,491 --> 00:03:01,480
interest in having a lot more to them
with respect to food.

44
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,870
So that is likely to be the early
adoption of this technology,

45
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,510
but the long run promise of being able
to move things around in inside of

46
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:18,541
cities and the suburban areas in
particular without having to create more

47
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:23,941
traffic congestion without the carbon
footprint that comes from large trucks

48
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,010
moving packages around without the sound
and safety problems produced by large

49
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:32,260
trucks moving around our city.

50
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,730
All of those problems can be solved by
flying what you want,

51
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,880
what you need right now to you through
the air.

52
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,030
We're public about the fact that we did
more than a thousand flights last year

53
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,560
in wing,
and I would like to see,

54
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,830
um,
at least a hundred times that many this

55
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,620
year and 100 times as many of the year
after that.

56
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:56,440
And,
and I don't think that that's a at all

57
00:03:56,441 --> 00:04:00,730
out of the question,
there are regulatory conversations to be

58
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:05,731
had and demonstrations of safety to be
proven as we step through this process

59
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,130
in the United States and in other
countries.

60
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,400
And it's important that we push hard on
the technology,

61
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,570
but also work thoughtfully and
responsibly with the regulators to

62
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:20,710
demonstrate the safety and to build
their confidence in what we're doing as

63
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:22,690
we take each incremental step.
