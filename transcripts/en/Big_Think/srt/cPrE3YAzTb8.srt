1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,730
Oh,
I think it's been terrible.

2
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,680
Uh,
you know,

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,690
I think the whole embedding process was
a masterstroke of the Pentagon's,

4
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:27,171
a ability to sort of turn journalists
into cheerleaders and I'm a co op and he

5
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:33,330
sort of independent thinking it's very
hard as a journalist to go into a

6
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:35,240
conflict completely,
uh,

7
00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:37,620
um,
fresh eyed when you've been through

8
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,420
training courses where you have to learn
to put on a gas mask and nine seconds

9
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:43,890
flat,
uh,

10
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:48,891
where you are traveling with US troops
and you're expecting to be gassed by

11
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:55,101
these terrible Iraqis at any moment and
people are shooting at you as you go

12
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:59,640
through a country and the people
protecting you with the ones that you're

13
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:02,880
supposed to be writing about as one
part.

14
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:06,390
Hopefully one part of a conflict.
And unfortunately the,

15
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:07,950
the,
the,

16
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:10,470
um,
the coverage was very obviously one

17
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:15,360
sided because there was no access to any
other side.

18
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,490
And um,
and there was for a while,

19
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:20,970
you know,
when Baghdad fell and as it was falling,

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
a number of us left rm beds as quickly
as possible and tried to get out and

21
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:31,170
into a meet and live with a Iraqis in
Baghdad.

22
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,540
And,
and that,

23
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,570
that,
that happened for a number of months

24
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:40,590
before the kidnappings and the situation
in,

25
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,910
in Baghdad became so dangerous that
journalists will no longer able to go

26
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:46,440
out and freely report.
And so,

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,570
um,
once again,

28
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:50,970
we have a situation where most of the
news,

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,970
fresh news from journalists,
at least Western journalists in,

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,833
in,
uh,

31
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,910
in Iraq is being done from behind,
you know,

32
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:04,911
behind the lines of American troops.
And I'm with only feelers being sent out

33
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:09,920
for very quick runs into a,
you know,

34
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,080
the Iraqi.
I'm a residential area.
