1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,020
What inspires me

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,860
making a difference in the world,
leaving a legacy or making a difference,

3
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:12,460
having an impact on the lives of other
people and feeling like,

4
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:14,110
Hey,
my life has been worthwhile.

5
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:18,220
I did have some modest impact on,
on the people I encountered in this

6
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:19,900
world.
And uh,

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,040
and leading a life of integrity,
of being true to what I believe in

8
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,380
without compromising that in order to
get ahead.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:31,210
I look for lessons closest to the people
closest to me from my wife who is my

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,560
partner,
if you will.

11
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,980
And uh,
from other leaders who might have known

12
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:37,960
and worked with.
I have a men's group,

13
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:40,630
but I learned a lot from them and a
couples group,

14
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:43,060
but we've been together both them for
more than 20 years.

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,670
Uh,
and so I certainly learned a lot,

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,190
uh,
and also going back to great books and

17
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:50,050
learning what others have learned over
time,

18
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,700
but how do we bring that forward into a
current day context and watching what

19
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:57,190
other leaders are doing and try to learn
from them?

20
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:01,941
No.
All my life,

21
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:05,450
I've been interested in leaders in part
that was imprinted on me by my father

22
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:07,610
who thought he should have been a leader
and never was.

23
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,570
And so from a very early age I was
reading books on great leaders have,

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,520
you know,
people like Abraham Lincoln,

25
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,510
you know,
just a wide range of leaders.

26
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,520
Everything I could get my hands on is a
79 year old boy.

27
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,380
Teaching takes many forms.
I don't know if you want to stay with

28
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:29,500
teaching leadership.
Certainly we have people teaching is

29
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:31,330
great things in many,
many,

30
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,680
many forms.
But this is leadership I think has been

31
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,910
under appreciated as an area of academic
concentration.

32
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:43,300
I think we've been too concentrated on
financial management and not enough on

33
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,870
helping people become better leaders and
creating an environment in which they

34
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:48,790
could throughout their lifetime and
teach.

35
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,670
Learning them,
teaching them how to learn throughout

36
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:54,670
their lifetimes to take on more
opportunities and to lead.

37
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,190
So there,
I think it's been a real vacuum and the

38
00:01:57,191 --> 00:02:01,630
teaching of leadership in academic
institutions and I think corporations

39
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:04,600
have looked at it too much as
socialization to company.

40
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:04,760
No.
