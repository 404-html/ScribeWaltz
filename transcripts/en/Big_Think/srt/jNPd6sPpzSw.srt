1
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,710
I guess all Americans have a favorite
period of American history.

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,080
Uh,
mine is the period of the founding

3
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:20,600
fathers.
Uh,

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,280
I've really been quite enchanted by
them.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,510
We were a very small country,
four or 5 million people,

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,320
but we produced in a period of a few
years a flowering of political changes.

7
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,360
Just remarkable,
I think unprecedented really in the

8
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:42,150
history of the world.
And I like all of them.

9
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:45,190
I guess I've read a good bit about them,
the giants.

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,680
But my particular favorite is,
uh,

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,620
James Madison.
Uh,

12
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,240
Madison of course did not have all that
successful,

13
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,900
the tenure as president,
but he was the father of the

14
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:02,670
constitution.
And I've been a kind of attracted to him

15
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:06,330
because I've always felt that he,
uh,

16
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,550
he could never have gotten elected to
Congress.

17
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,660
He was a small man about five foot tall.
He had a pockmarked face.

18
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,120
He was a lousy speaker,
uh,

19
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,370
on television.
He'd had been a disaster.

20
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,350
Uh,
but he was a political genius because he

21
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,300
was able to,
uh,

22
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,730
put together,
if you would,

23
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,820
large portions of the constitution.
So my interest has really been with the

24
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:37,920
founding fathers.
I have others.

25
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:42,000
I admire Lincoln of course,
like all Americans I admire.

26
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,280
Uh,
but the founding fathers,

27
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:46,140
I,
I feel a deep,

28
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,890
deep sense of appreciation for,
uh,

29
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:50,970
because of what they did.

30
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:59,330
Uh,
the question I would repeatedly get when

31
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:04,890
I was conducting public meetings in
Indiana was where the leaders,

32
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,880
it's the question you just asked and I
think it's a hundred minds of an awful

33
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:10,980
lot of Americans.
Where are the Lincolns,

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,020
the Jeffersons,
the Washingtons?

35
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,630
I don't know that I know the answer to
that,

36
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:20,631
but I think part of the answer may be
that the country is just a lot more

37
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:26,550
complicated,
a lot more difficult to govern today

38
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,790
because of its size and because of its
diversity,

39
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:33,570
because of the acceleration if you would
have life,

40
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,340
uh,
and the political skill that is most

41
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,370
needed in this presidential election or
any political election from my point of

42
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:49,821
view is the ability to build consensus
behind a solution.

43
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,760
It's not very hard really to walk into a
room of people where you're discussing a

44
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:02,901
difficult issue and blow it apart.
I know it's not very hard because I've

45
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:08,701
done it on a few occasions.
What is really hard is to walk into that

46
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:13,801
room and to build a consensus behind a
solution to the problem that you're

47
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:19,051
talking about.
That is political skill and that is the

48
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:22,900
skill most needed in this great big,
diverse,

49
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:27,901
complicated country with all of these
conflicting interests that we have

50
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,670
consensus building.
That's what I look for in a politician.

51
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,370
I think we've got a lot of work to do.
Uh,

52
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:47,371
I think we've had quite a setback and we
have not used that power as wisely and

53
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:51,130
prudently and effectively as we should
have used it,

54
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,370
particularly with regard to the war in
Iraq.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,110
But this is behind us now and we've got,
we are where we are.

56
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,650
We can't change recent events and recent
history.

57
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,510
So I think we have to apply American
power pragmatically.

58
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,300
Uh,
realistically,

59
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,060
uh,
we have to make sure that

60
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,390
we do not set goals for ourselves that
we cannot achieve.

61
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,010
When President Bush said we're going to
end tyranny in the world,

62
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,700
uh,
that is idealism beyond reach.

63
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,910
When President Kennedy said,
we must bear any burden,

64
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,930
uh,
that is beyond reach.

65
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,110
It's an ideal,
but the problem is matching resources to

66
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:47,290
achieve your goals.
And Americans I think have tended to

67
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:52,291
overreach in the world and to think that
our power is so great that we can

68
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:56,440
achieve all kinds of things.

69
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,920
Uh,
I have become impressed with the

70
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:04,921
limitations of American power and with
the necessity of matching our goals with

71
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:13,951
the means to achieve those goals and to
apply for ourselves pragmatic objectives

72
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,910
around the world,
achievable objectives and to,

73
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,320
to think that we can suddenly make
democracy bloom in Saudi Arabia and

74
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:29,410
Egypt and Pakistan,
uh,

75
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,810
is is a stretch.
We can't do it,

76
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,540
but I'm also impressed that American
ideals are good and solid,

77
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,710
but we cannot accomplish them without a
lot of help.

78
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,200
If you sit down and try to name the most
difficult problems that bother you.

79
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,710
I don't know what it might be.
A climate change,

80
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,600
drugs,
uh,

81
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,290
conflicts of all kinds,
rising tensions in the world,

82
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,580
uh,
HIV aids,

83
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,670
whatever,
nuclear proliferation,

84
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,750
you have to be impressed,
I think with the fact that you cannot

85
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,770
achieve those goals by yourself.
We have to have held as big as we are,

86
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,770
as smart as we are,
as rich as we are.

87
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,490
We need help and we have to learn to
work together.

88
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:24,140
The great
genius of American diplomacy,

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,610
uh,
came about it,

90
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:29,390
at least in my lifetime after World War
II,

91
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:35,260
when the idealism of the American people
was captured pragmatically and we

92
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:42,310
rebuilt Europe with the Marshall Plan.
Europeans leading the way of course,

93
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:47,180
but with our health and we had this
flowering of diplomacy,

94
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,240
the World Bank,
the IMF,

95
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,630
what eventually came,
became the WTO,

96
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:56,570
the World Trade Organization of the
United Nations.

97
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:58,280
In other words,
we,

98
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,730
we advanced American interests,
but we did it by cooperating with other

99
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:08,600
countries around the world.
We did not say this is the way it's

100
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:11,510
going to be.
It's going to be the American model.

101
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,350
We're going to do it our way.
We're going to impose it upon you.

102
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:20,170
We rejected that and we took the
generosity of the American public.

103
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:25,100
Just think for a moment.
We defeated Japan and Germany.

104
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,880
They were the great evil at all.
Fiddler Tojo.

105
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:33,920
Some people were,
remember that the emperor of Japan,

106
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,320
after the war,
we immediately turned around immediately

107
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,500
and gave aid to those countries.
What a remarkable thing to think of that

108
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:51,010
we gave aid to the people we had been
fighting for years.

109
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,670
Well,
how do you capture that spirit again,

110
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,970
that generosity,
that pragmatism,

111
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,570
that ability to advance your interest,
but also include the interest of others?

112
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,730
That's the great challenge for us.

113
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,360
Uh,
you'd have to say leadership.

114
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,820
I believe.
You'd have to say that.

115
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:18,890
Uh,
we've lost a little bit of that

116
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:20,420
imagination,
uh,

117
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:22,270
that are,
uh,

118
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:27,340
predecessors had after World War II.
We lack their generosity of spirit

119
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,500
there.
Magnanimity uh,

120
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,710
we've got to try to recapture that.
If we,

121
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,870
if we're really going to be the leader
of the world,

122
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,890
we can't sit down at the international
conference table and say,

123
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:41,150
okay,
this is the agenda.

124
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,690
We're going to dictate the agenda.
We've got to sit down at that table and

125
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:50,510
promote our agenda,
whatever it may be,

126
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:54,260
fighting terrorism or whatever.
But we've also got to sit there and

127
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:56,370
listen to what the other side has to
say.

128
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,930
Don't necessarily have to agree with it,
don't have to make a lot of concessions,

129
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,890
but you do have to try to learn to
understand it,

130
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,310
to accommodate it if possible.
And if not defined areas where you can

131
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:13,380
agree and work on those where you cannot
agree.
