1
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,010
I,
I was so young when I was in New York,

2
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,390
I certainly wrote a lot,

3
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,780
but last time I was here I found it
really distracting.

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,400
I was hard to stay indoors because I
wanted to be out all the time.

5
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,510
Um,
I think the most important thing is to

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,570
just get a ritual down wherever you are.
Process.

7
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,010
Well there's two parts to it.
There's the long term process of a novel

8
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,380
and then there's the daily stuff,
you know,

9
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:47,980
it's like planning for a marathon.
You,

10
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,590
a,
you set up your training schedule,

11
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,940
you know,
you have your idea.

12
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:53,050
And I,
I plotted out,

13
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:56,410
I have to make a huge outline of it and
about.

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,490
And then I work every day about nine to
two or three.

15
00:01:00,491 --> 00:01:05,491
I have to get three pages down everyday
and there's usually a point about 150

16
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:08,890
pages in where everything falls apart.
We're,

17
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:13,570
all the plans are for not.
The book has become something else and I

18
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:18,571
have a nervous breakdown and then I
submit to what the book has become and I

19
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:20,644
keep going

20
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,180
and that's a terrible.
And then a great time.

21
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,350
No one likes to be around me during that
to tell people.

22
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:35,710
I mean,
I really think it's just

23
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,620
what everyone says.
It's a.

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,620
it's willpower kind of a game that
there's.

25
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,680
Because the weirdest part in graduate
school was that the most talented

26
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:45,690
writers,
we're not the ones who became writers.

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,720
It was the dog had once and that.
That's actually talent too I guess is

28
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:56,271
just being willing to go every day and
stay there until the pages appear every

29
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,700
day and not.
I tell this to my students too.

30
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:01,530
I'm like,
I know you can write a short story

31
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:03,630
overnight,
but that's not the job.

32
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,790
That's not a longterm skill.

33
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,770
You need to write a short story over a
month,

34
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,550
every month and I think that's it.
I don't think it's the right decision

35
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:19,480
for everyone.
You know?

36
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:21,280
It was,
I was coming from New York,

37
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,930
I couldn't afford anything.
I was having a hard time figuring out

38
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:28,290
how to be a writer here and I'm going
to.

39
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:32,280
Montana was a very attractive,
completely different plan and it worked

40
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,870
out great for me,
but

41
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,920
I'm not sure it helped my writing,
you know,

42
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,580
because you have a committee of people
who are also lung young like you and

43
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:45,960
don't really know how to do it well
either,

44
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,410
so it's a funny committee to be
submitting your work too and you have to

45
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,620
really know the confident in what you're
doing because I wasn't writing like

46
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,420
anyone else there and that was hard for
me to figure out and I think it would

47
00:02:57,421 --> 00:03:00,550
be.
And it's destructive to a novel for sure

48
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,630
because you meet every week with part of
a novel that really what you should

49
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,110
tell you a novelist is keep going until
you finished the draft.

50
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:14,470
Don't trust anyone
in Montana.

51
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,470
Yeah,
it was,

52
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,190
it was great.
But

53
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,760
then also it was pretty cold,
dark winters.

54
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:25,280
I guess that helps novel writing to
historically,

55
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:28,430
but it also helps drinking,
you know,

56
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,950
at those times.
But maybe that helps a novel too.

57
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,660
But I love it.
I go,

58
00:03:32,661 --> 00:03:34,070
I go every year.
You know,

59
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,880
I stay for a long time.
I love going to writers colonies and

60
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:39,890
pastoral settings where there's nothing
to do,

61
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,293
but

62
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,960
either walk around or read a book or
work on your book and they all seem

63
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:50,380
helpful
in felonies.

64
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,750
I'm going there and then a month.
Yeah,

65
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,920
I can't wait.
You work all day and produce so much

66
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:05,921
work and it doesn't feel like work.
It just feels like it feels like when

67
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:09,620
you start out writing and you just want
to write all the time and you're just so

68
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:11,450
excited about everything you're doing.
It feels like that.

69
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,540
Again,
it's hard to recreate because a lot of

70
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,660
time it feels like a job.

71
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,310
It's like you're building something
really huge.
