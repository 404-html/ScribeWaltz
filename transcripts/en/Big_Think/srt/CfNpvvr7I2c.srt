1
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,870
We all experience emotionally charged
conflicts,

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,780
whether it's in the workplace with a
colleague,

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,040
whether it's at home with a spouse,
whether it's even in our country,

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,370
dealing with political issues,
the challenges,

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,140
how do we deal with them most
effectively.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,270
Now,
my sense is that most people come in

7
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:26,550
with like the quick fix answer,
uh,

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,520
the rational approaches just listen a
little bit more,

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,490
talk a little bit less,
and that's useful,

10
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:36,090
but that's not enough.
Beneath rationality is this other layer

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,400
to the conflict,
which is the emotional layer.

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,270
You're starting to get angry.
You're colleague is starting to get

13
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:47,040
angry and things start to fester,
but even that is not the fundamental

14
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,890
force driving us in conflict.
What's the core?

15
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,830
It's identity.
At the end of the day,

16
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:56,370
what tends to fuel our emotions in a
conflict is a threat.

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,410
Who we are and what we stand for,
and the moment I threaten what you

18
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:05,670
deeply care about,
all of a sudden now we have a real

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,260
emotionally charged conflict.

20
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,680
So the moment your identity feels
threatened,

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,640
all of a sudden you fall prey to a very
dangerous mindset that I call the tribes

22
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:22,350
effect.
This is an US versus them mindset.

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,310
You could be in a conflict with somebody
you love your mother,

24
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:28,080
your kid,
but the moment you get into this

25
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:30,450
mindset,
it becomes me versus you,

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,460
US versus them.
Think about a conflict in your own life.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,290
There are three basic characteristics to
this tribal mentality.

28
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,140
One,
it's adversarial.

29
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,650
It is me versus you to it's self
righteous.

30
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,590
I believe I am right and legitimate in
my perspective and I believe you are

31
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:59,970
wrong and crazy and element number
three,

32
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,970
this tribes effect.
It is a closed system,

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,590
so I will argue and defend my
perspective to no ends,

34
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,890
but I am going to close my ears to your
perspective.

35
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,570
This is the tribes effect.
We fall into it in the family dynamic

36
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,110
and unfortunately just as true national
dynamics,

37
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:22,020
international dynamics,
we see the polarizations there.

38
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,630
Once you attach to a tribe,
something strange happens.

39
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,730
No longer is content as important.
The substance of the arguments,

40
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,140
the the policies that is important,
but at the end of the day,

41
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,530
the most important element in terms of
being a part of a tribe is loyalty,

42
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,220
loyalty to the tribe,
and the most serious offense that you

43
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:52,221
can commit against your own tribe is to
betray that tribe's trust.

44
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:54,240
It's loyalty.
It's essence.

45
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,250
It's to go against the tribe in some
way.

46
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,780
You look at the United States now,
they're these huge political divides.

47
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,970
You see the democratic tribe or tribes.
You see the Republican tribes as well,

48
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,330
and it's very difficult for either side
to even say,

49
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:14,860
I understand what you're saying because
some on the inside of each side are

50
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,700
going to say,
oh,

51
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,550
nope.
They're betraying our tribe,

52
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,960
and the moment betraying the tribe,
that's a taboo.

53
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,370
If I break a taboo,
I can suffer social punishments.

54
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,360
I'm going to be excommunicated.
I'm going to be ridiculed or worse.

55
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,840
That's the challenge of our tribalistic
world that we're in right now.

56
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,440
So you can have somebody in Trumpville
or Clintonville who,

57
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,433
uh,
you know,

58
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,520
totally is getting hammered by.
Well,

59
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:45,310
let's say in the trump world,
because totally going to get hammered by

60
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:46,990
the by,
it changes to healthcare,

61
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,780
but they're still in that camp because
they're part of the tribe.

62
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,440
Recognizing that identity is critical.
It sort of opens our eyes to what might

63
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:59,140
be going on in the world around us and
our communities around us.

64
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,200
Think about some of let's think about
some of the issues that are in the

65
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,300
public sphere,
abortion,

66
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,420
healthcare,
taxes,

67
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,010
security of the country.
All of these issues hit right to the

68
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:16,780
core of our identity,
who we are and what we stand for.

69
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:22,460
And the moment I feel that any of those
elements is threatened now I moved

70
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:26,140
toward the tribes effect.
Now I want to move toward being with a

71
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:30,910
group of people like myself who are
going to protect me and my interests

72
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:36,180
from becoming trampled on.
And a powerful tool you can do is to

73
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,420
emphasize the US,
the two of us,

74
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,780
you know,
moving from ego to we go,

75
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,700
there we go.
And it's a big difference watching

76
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:51,700
conflict situations.
I've noticed something interesting,

77
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,700
you know,
at first people are battling it out,

78
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:59,701
my perspective versus yours and all of
the energy is moving toward my ego and

79
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:02,860
my perspective versus your ego and your
perspectives.

80
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,930
When you start to see the transition,
what starts to happen is that each side

81
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:12,220
recognizes there's also an us,
there's me and there's you,

82
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:17,221
but there's also the space between us
that we are creating together and the

83
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:21,880
more you can emphasize the US,
the more you can move toward real

84
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:26,260
reconciliation or the two of you moving
together towards some cooperative and

85
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:29,060
sustainable outcome.
I mean,

86
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,750
looking at the rhetoric in the United
States right now,

87
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,080
there's so much divisive rhetoric.
Where are the voices of us,

88
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,770
the United States of America,
and the more you get those kinds of

89
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:43,930
voices,
the more you can start to,

90
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:47,200
in a sense,
overpower the US versus them thinking.

91
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,360
We're not trying to overpower.
The idea is that the people have behind

92
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,110
their us versus them thinking.
We're trying to overpower that

93
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,610
adversarial mindset.

94
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,390
Mm.
