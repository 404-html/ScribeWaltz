1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,070
Hardly anyone has raised more
conscientious,

2
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:12,000
imaginative children than the legendary
mid century children's book editor,

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,800
Ursula Nordstrom who brought to life
such multigenerational classics as

4
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:20,250
Margaret Wise Brands.
Goodnight Moon Ed White's Charlotte's

5
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:22,020
web,
Shel Silverstein's,

6
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:25,350
the giving tree,
and Maurice Sendak's where the wild

7
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:28,680
things are.
During her long tenure at Harper and

8
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:32,040
row,
Nordstrom was not just an editor to her

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,440
authors at her artists,
but their friend.

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,720
They're confident,
their therapists,

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,750
their greatest champion always.
She stood up against censorship and

12
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:45,390
constantly bolstered the creative
confidence of these young writers and

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,270
artists.
She was a special instrumental and the

14
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:53,130
life of Maurice Sendak who might not be
who we know him as today without her,

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,630
and she,
by the way,

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,420
was a beautiful letter writer.
Her letters are collected in a book

17
00:00:57,421 --> 00:01:01,290
called dear genius by the Children's
book historian Leonard Marcus.

18
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,090
And so in one exchange with Sendak,
he wrote to her despairing over having

19
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:10,470
been commissioned to illustrate the work
of tolstoy and feeling utterly

20
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:12,780
inadequate to match tolstoy's genius.

21
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,530
And so she wrote to him and said,
you may not be tolstoy.

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,630
Tolstoy wasn't sendak either.
You have a vast and beautiful genius.

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,710
This emboldens Sendak enormously,
and by the following year,

24
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:29,070
he was already working on his very own
where the wild things are,

25
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,300
which went on to become one of the most
beloved children's books of all time.

26
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,200
But most of all,
nordstrom defended the world and the

27
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:42,201
experience of the child against all the
commercial pressures for commodities and

28
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:47,241
conformity and politely boring
storytelling that dominated children's

29
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:52,140
books at the time.
And so the most benevolent patron saint

30
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:56,670
of modern childhood ended up being a gay
woman working at the height of

31
00:01:56,671 --> 00:02:01,671
consumerism and somehow managing to
publish an envision and defend books

32
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:05,780
that were not forgettable commodities,
but extraordinary masterworks.

33
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,790
That's stood the test of time and moved
and inspired and enchanted generations.
