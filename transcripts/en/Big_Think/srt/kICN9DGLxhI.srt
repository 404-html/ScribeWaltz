1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,600
We are entering what I call the golden
era of space exploration.

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,900
The first golden era was back in the 19
sixties,

3
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:16,320
but it was unsustainable.
In 1966,

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,350
the NASA budget consumed five percent of
the entire federal budget.

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,960
It was impossible to sustain that level
of spending.

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,170
Now it's about point five percent.
However,

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,210
now with the injunction of new ideas,
fresh enthusiasm from the private

8
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:35,250
sector,
from Silicon Valley,

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,670
billionaires,
we have a whole new different landscape.

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,910
Just recently we had that sensational
launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,640
financed by zero,
zero amount of taxpayers dollars,

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,910
and it shows you that the economics have
changed and now with the introduction of

13
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:57,210
reusable rockets,
we're not talking about opening up the

14
00:00:57,211 --> 00:01:02,211
heavens to perhaps a whole new economic
landscape that is 10 percent.

15
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,250
The cost of the past to put me in orbit
around the earth,

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,650
cost about $10,000 a pound.

17
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,240
That's my weight in gold.
Think of my body made out of solid gold.

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,870
That's where it takes me to put,
just to go around the earth in near

19
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,900
orbit to go to the moon would cost about
$100,000 a pound to put me on a Mars

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,840
because at least a million dollars a
pound that is unsustainable and that's

21
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:33,720
where the reusable rockets come in
because we're not talking about dropping

22
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:38,370
the cost by a factor of 10.
Instead of $10,000 a pound spacex,

23
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,410
wants to bring it down to a thousand
dollars a pound.

24
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,690
December of 2019.
NASA will send the sls booster rocket

25
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:52,761
and the Orion module around the moon on
a robotic unmanned mission.

26
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,870
Just a few years after that,
the first astronauts will go back to the

27
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:02,871
moon after a 50 year gap and buy later
the next decade.

28
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:08,160
We hope to have a lunar orbiter,
lunar orbiter that gives us a permanent

29
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,850
presence in outer space,
not just the space station,

30
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:12,840
but a lunar orbiter.

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,140
And from that we want to go all the way
to Mars.

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,790
And so NASA has already now look at the
blueprints made by Boeing aircraft

33
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,170
concerning what it would take to send
probes to Mars.

34
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,870
In fact,
we may even have a traffic accident

35
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,950
around Mars because of the fact that
space x not to be done,

36
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,090
they're proposing their big rocket to
take us,

37
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:40,590
not just to the moon with the dragon
space capsule and the and the Falcon

38
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:42,750
heavy rocket,
but a new rocket,

39
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,590
the bfr rocket to take us all the way to
Mars,

40
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,620
even bypassing the lunar orbiter.
We also have a new vision emerging for

41
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:56,670
Elon musk of space x is to create a
multiplanetary species.

42
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,280
However,
for Jeff Bezos of Amazon,

43
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,740
he wants to make earth into a park so
that all the heavy industries,

44
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:10,171
all the pollution goes into outer space.
And Jeff Bezos wants to set an Amazon

45
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,410
type delivery system connecting the
earth to the moon.

46
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,620
I was talked to Carl Sagan and he said
that because the earth is in the middle

47
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,750
of a shooting gallery of asteroids and
comets and meteors,

48
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,550
it's inevitable that we will be hit with
a planet buster.

49
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,290
Something like,
what?

50
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:34,291
Hit the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.
We need an insurance policy now.

51
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:38,680
He was clear to say that we're not
talking about moving the population of

52
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:43,360
the earth into outer space that costs
too much money and we have problems of

53
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:47,020
our own on the earth by global warming.
We have to deal with those problems on

54
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:50,020
the earth,
not fleeing in outer space,

55
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:55,120
but as an insurance policy.
We have to make sure that that humans

56
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:58,750
become a two planet species.
These are the words of Carl Sagan,

57
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,140
and now of course Elon Musk,
he wants to put it up to a million a

58
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,040
million colonists on the planet Mars
send to Mars by his rockets,

59
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,570
financed by a combination of public and
private funding.

60
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,580
And remember,
he has the vision,

61
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,000
the energy,
and the checkbook to make many of these

62
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:20,950
ideas into a reality.
