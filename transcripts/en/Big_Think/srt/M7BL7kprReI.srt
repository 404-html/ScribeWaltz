1
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,440
That is used in many ways and in a
spiritual life

2
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:18,810
fascination that we have for food and
for taste is can be a very wonderful and

3
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:25,750
exciting adventure in life.
But it can also be a distraction from

4
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:30,700
the important work of life.
All the tastes and sights and sounds of

5
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:33,490
the world are the same.
They're wonderful,

6
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,100
they're amazing.
They should be celebrated.

7
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:38,560
But at the same time,
uh,

8
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:43,561
we can use things like restraint and
diet as a way to give us more time and

9
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:48,070
energy to concentrate on more
impossibly,

10
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:48,700
uh,
uh,

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,420
things that we wouldn't neglect,
uh,

12
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,580
in our lives through the easy
distractions,

13
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:57,520
the sights and sounds of the world of
which food is,

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,130
is one of those.
So the word in Sanskrit is taught or a

15
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,340
steroidy.
So you,

16
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,790
you try to simplify your diet to reduce
it to the lowest common denominators so

17
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:12,100
that it would be nutritious.

18
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,820
That's one aspect of diet.
Another aspect of diet that is the most

19
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:23,581
important aspect of diet for the Yogi is
that you trying to remove all the

20
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:29,401
violence from your diet so that,
uh,

21
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:35,190
no one suffered so that your plate could
be full and that you are grateful that,

22
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,410
um,
that you obtain this food with the least

23
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:46,000
amount of suffering.
Each one of us causes suffering just by

24
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:48,530
being on this earth.
Um,

25
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,050
when we just innocently step our foot
down on the sidewalk,

26
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:57,400
we're stepping on many microorganisms
that weren't hurting us at all.

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,100
Just trying to establish little
communities.

28
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,500
Uh,
they're in the,

29
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,180
in the sidewalk and,
uh,

30
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:09,210
so a Yogi tries to be conscious of every
step in that way so that we wouldn't

31
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:13,270
cause unnecessary harm.
The same is true for diet.

32
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,810
Um,
many of the things that get to our plate

33
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:21,811
gets get there only through a lot of
suffering and deprivation.

34
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,313
And,
uh,

35
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,000
so a Yogi tries to remove that and,
uh,

36
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,790
obviously,
uh,

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,550
that if you take the sentient beings out
of your diet,

38
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,740
that is if you eat a vegan diet where no
animal products are included,

39
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:44,070
you're taking a large chunk of that
suffering that you've caused out of your

40
00:02:44,591 --> 00:02:49,591
life.
And that removal of a selfish path in

41
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:52,720
life,
that,

42
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,380
uh,
awareness of how your choices impact

43
00:02:56,381 --> 00:03:00,550
others changes you and it also the world
around you.

44
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:01,210
It's quite,
yeah.
