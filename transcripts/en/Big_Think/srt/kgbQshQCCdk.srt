1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,140
You've got to accept that not everybody
is going to care about every thing

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,150
equally.
And they're sort of different categories

3
00:00:11,151 --> 00:00:15,890
of people always in and around a given
cause or given effort.

4
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:19,490
I mean there are people who care
passionately about it who have a direct

5
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:24,491
personal connection.
What we wanted to be sure to do was make

6
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:29,270
sure that for the motivated person who's
got a target and a goal,

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,780
that that what we were engineering was
an incredible toolbox for them to use

8
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:41,081
all of our best ideas that we've ever
had and even to source from other people

9
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,470
by surfing around in the site,
effective ways of taking their

10
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:47,990
motivation and their energy and you
know,

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,200
leveraging it into really good
productivity in terms of their personal

12
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:56,000
fundraising.
So on the one hand you want to supply

13
00:00:56,001 --> 00:01:00,380
the motivated person with everything
they need to do a really good job.

14
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,940
The next ring out is people who might
not have a specific connection.

15
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,970
And if the motivated person who cares,
who's reaching out to their own circles

16
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:13,430
of people,
take people who are already donors to

17
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:18,290
you and turn them into small fundraisers
for you.

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,951
You know,
I mean,

19
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:21,920
if a person is capable of giving 50
bucks themselves,

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,090
but it's really easy for them to reach
out to their family and friends and just

21
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:28,250
on the strength of personal
relationships,

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,570
say,
could I get,

23
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,250
um,
you know,

24
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,460
10 more people to donate 50 bucks,
then they've just multiplied their own

25
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:41,450
capacity by 10 times.
Anyone who was involved in fundraising

26
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:44,420
will tell you that that kind of
multiplying effect has huge

27
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,860
ramifications.
