1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,670
A greater return to self discipline,
I a greater return to foresight and a

2
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:10,620
much greater willingness to serve
others,

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,640
to look for opportunities out of a
American athletes and the affluence they

4
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:18,840
have joined.
I've enjoyed to try to serve the poor

5
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:22,950
and needy elsewhere and and also a
recognition that you serve the poor and

6
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:27,951
needy best if you use the old cliche,
teach them how to fish rather than just

7
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:34,011
giving them a fish.
The great inner energy of capitalism is

8
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:41,691
to make things work and to invent and
create new things that didn't exist

9
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:44,280
before.
New businesses that didn't exist before

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,870
and that requires a certain vision and a
willingness to take a chance.

11
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:52,380
And I see lots of that goodness.
Our new technologies encouraged that

12
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:54,970
don't they?
I mean all the things possibility and

13
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,300
with communications these days,
they're just amazing.

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,920
I see my grandchildren,
they're just fascinated by all the new

15
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:04,290
technologies,
all the different media and they seem to

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,950
lip surrounded by them.
I can hardly understand how to make some

17
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:09,950
of them work and they do it just like
that.
