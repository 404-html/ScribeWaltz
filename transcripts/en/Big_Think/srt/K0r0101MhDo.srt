1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,990
Yeah,

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,470
well if I were,
I give you that answer of course,

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,220
but it was Charles Darwin.
I'll give you another answer and in fact

4
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:17,810
if I was Adam Smith,
I'd give you a third.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,850
Will have too many answers for you.
I'm the mechanical era sort of obviated

6
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:27,560
the need for doomsday predictions with
regards to out of control populations

7
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:30,920
because every time it appeared that we
couldn't do anything more,

8
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:34,000
we could do something more.
So we had the first green revolutions,

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,250
which I just talked about.
The second green revolution came when it

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,700
became obvious that if you don't start
fertilizing the ground with her

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,220
fertilizers,
with food and supplements,

12
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:46,130
I should say,
and if we don't start trying to get rid

13
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:49,940
of the competitor species,
namely the weeds with herbicides and,

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,160
and also the pests that want to eat this
crop,

15
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,050
that we can now grow to two profusion as
the result of the invention of dynamite.

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,460
By the way.
Uh,

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,260
yeah,
because it allowed us to clear the

18
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,960
fields of all those rotten little trees
that we had to get rid of.

19
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,290
So too bad because we could use those
trees again.

20
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,680
Um,
we now find ourselves in another dilemma

21
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:14,420
where we think the population will peak
and the food supply will dwindle.

22
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,500
So once again,
involved in a Malthusian a mind game.

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,370
I don't believe that for a minute.
I think that whatever problem is

24
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:26,300
presented to the human species,
we've got such a big cerebral cortex.

25
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,800
We can solve it if we all agree to and
that's,

26
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,070
that's the issue.
Do we want to solve the next problem to

27
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,640
usher in the third green revolution?
The second one was all of those

28
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:39,890
pesticides,
herbicides and fertilizer things,

29
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,220
plus not genetically modified foods,
but certainly a highly selected foods.

30
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:47,930
And in fact,
if you look at our food since day,

31
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,220
virtually every crop that's grown
originated from some wild plant that you

32
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:53,300
would not recognize.

33
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,550
An apple is about the size of a pea.
It started out in the middle of Russia

34
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,020
someplace,
and if you took a bite of it,

35
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:02,240
you wouldn't be able to eat for a week.
Your mouth will be closed.

36
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,540
It's so sour that you wouldn't believe
that someone would actually want to eat

37
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:09,050
this thing,
but yet domestication of that plant has

38
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:10,970
now resulted in,
believe it or not,

39
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:15,971
20,000 different varieties of apples
from a single unit plant.

40
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,650
All right,
so you look at wheat,

41
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,210
it's been the same.
You look at rice,

42
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:23,630
it's been the same.
We've been marvelous at selecting crops

43
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:28,460
to fit into climates that are suited for
the optimum growth of those plants,

44
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,250
but what was there before?
That's the point there.

45
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,070
There was a natural ecosystem there
before we planted those.
