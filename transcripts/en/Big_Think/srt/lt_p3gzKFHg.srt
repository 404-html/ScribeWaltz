1
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,280
Well,
I'm,

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,280
I'm very concerned about the traditional
foods versus imitation foods.

3
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:18,900
I still find people asking me,
um,

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,300
about soy butter that doesn't contain
trans fats because now they know trans

5
00:00:24,821 --> 00:00:28,650
fats are bad.
They're still asking me about a

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,720
substitute foods and imitations and
engineered foods and foods with added

7
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:37,000
this or removed that.
And what I want them to understand is

8
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:38,650
that the whole traditional foods are
best,

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,100
even if they can't afford the best
quality version of beef or eggs or milk,

10
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,260
they ought to be consuming beef or eggs
or milk instead of Ersatz foods.

11
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,670
Um,
and,

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,820
and I'm also concerned about a plant
based diet for,

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,880
um,
for pregnant mothers and for young

14
00:00:57,881 --> 00:00:58,714
children.
Um,

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,840
there is a trend in many urban areas for
young children to be vegetarians and I,

16
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,450
I gather from parents and from
journalists that it's the children who

17
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:11,050
are requesting to be vegetarians.

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,180
Um,
and this is presented as charming.

19
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:18,100
Once Johnny finds out that I'm the,
the chicken breast comes from a chicken.

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,840
He can't bear to eat his friend.
The chicken.

21
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,320
Well,
um,

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,900
our son Julian,
who's three,

23
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,990
um,
helps me take apart chickens regularly.

24
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,390
He completely understands that his
friends,

25
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:30,220
the farm animals are also the foods we
eat.

26
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,430
We are omnivores and nature created us
as omnivores.

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,200
Um,
I think there are a lot of things

28
00:01:35,201 --> 00:01:37,780
five-year-olds might want.
They might want junk and they might want

29
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:39,040
junk television.
Um,

30
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:42,460
they might want to be vegetarians,
but it's not a good time for a person to

31
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:46,340
be a vegetarian.
If in adulthood you've been well fed 'em

32
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,470
in your mother's womb and at her breast
and in your growing years,

33
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:55,140
you want to experiment with a high
quality vegetarian diet or even have a

34
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,990
very carefully planned Vegan Diet.
I think that's acceptable,

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,200
but I,
I don't think it's right for children to

36
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:04,270
be raised as vegetarians even if they
ask.

37
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:10,710
The good news also is that there now I'm
ethically sound and ecologically sound

38
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:13,630
ways to be an omnivore.
And so I would urge you,

39
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:17,020
if you are,
if you are conscientious about these

40
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:21,250
matters,
to find the farmers who care for animals

41
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,270
and care for plants and care for the
environment and shop from them.
