1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,130
I
think so.

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,423
I mean you,

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,630
I think it becomes really hard if you,
if you have like,

4
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:17,744
um,
you know,

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,730
stringent rules about what you will and
won't do before you even hear the idea.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,931
Um,
you know,

7
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:26,990
like a lot of stuff comes to us and
we'll start writing it and usually what

8
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:28,170
we do is we just,
um,

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,960
anything that cracks us up,
you know,

10
00:00:29,961 --> 00:00:32,150
like if we're talking about something,
we all start laughing at it.

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,100
That's a really good thing.
And so we try to like,

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,090
oh,
why are we all laughing?

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,530
This seems like something that could be
good.

14
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,660
Um,
but,

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,231
uh,
you know,

16
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:41,710
sometimes you start laughing and stuff
and then you start writing it up and

17
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:42,650
then you're like,
Ooh,

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,450
do I really want to do that?
You know,

19
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:46,220
like,
do I really want to go and shoot that?

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,230
Because that's going to be embarrassing.
I mean,

21
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,260
we just sketched this year where I'm a
gay porn star and I get into a car

22
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:56,630
accident with Aziz and I die.

23
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,270
You know,
he caused the accident so my ghost

24
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:01,730
haunts him.
So everywhere he goes,

25
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,130
there's this gay porn star,
you know,

26
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,500
like harassing him and doing really
sexual,

27
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,420
horrible things to him.
And,

28
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:09,201
um,
you know,

29
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:10,810
we wrote that and we were like,
this is hilarious.

30
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:13,070
It's gonna be really funny.
And then it comes time to shoot that,

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,301
and then you're like,
oh,

32
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:15,770
great,
now I've got to do this.

33
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:20,330
So I had to like shave my entire body
and an oil at my body,

34
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:24,750
and then just being all these really
awkward sexual positions with disease

35
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,500
for long periods of time.
And so,

36
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,510
you know,
sometimes you write stuff and then later

37
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:30,290
on you look at it,
you're like,

38
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,520
ah,
we shouldn't have,

39
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,520
shouldn't have written that.
That's going to,

40
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,813
it's going to be different.

41
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:40,500
Okay.
