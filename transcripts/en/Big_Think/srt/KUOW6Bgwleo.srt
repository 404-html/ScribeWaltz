1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,920
Consciousness Freeville as often
misunderstood because we know what they

2
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:11,340
reference,
but it's difficult to know what by

3
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:13,170
content,
what we really mean by free will.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,820
A lot of people will immediately feel
that freewill is related to whether the

5
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:22,020
university is deterministic or
probabilistic and about physics has some

6
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,690
ideas about that which change every now
and then.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,500
It's not part of our experience and I
don't think it makes a difference.

8
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:32,460
If the universe forces you randomly to
do things or deterministically.

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,020
The important thing seems to meet that
in Freeville you are responsible for

10
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:40,410
your actions and responsibilities is
social interface.

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,330
For instance,
if I am told that if I do x,

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,360
I go to prison and this changes my
decision to whether or not to do x,

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,230
I'm obviously responsible for my
decision because it wasn't a spiel to my

14
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:57,840
responsibility in some sense or
likewise,

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,290
if I do a certain thing that it causes
harm to other people and they don't want

16
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,360
that harm to happen,
that influences my decision.

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,760
This is a just course of decision making
that we,

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,820
I would call,
it's a free vote decision.

19
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,200
We'll list the representation that my
nervous system at any level of its

20
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:17,280
functioning has raised a motive to an
intention.

21
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,130
It has committed to a particular kind of
goal.

22
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,850
Let's get integrated into the story of
myself,

23
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:27,060
this protocol that I experience of as
myself and as well,

24
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,040
and that was what I experienced as well
as it will decision and this decision is

25
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,210
free and in as much as this decision can
be influenced by this course.

26
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,340
So to me for evil is a social notion.
It means that this interface also have

27
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:44,100
social interaction of discourse of
thinking about things,

28
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:46,560
about this interface of knowledge,
language,

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,360
conceptual thought as relevant for that.
A decision if you a decision in which it

30
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,240
doesn't play a role for instance because
you already addicted to something and

31
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:56,250
you cannot stop doing it even if you
want to.

32
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,260
Then this decision I would say is not
free.

33
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,340
I grew up in eastern Germany,
it was communist,

34
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:05,820
eastern Germany and it was a very weird
ideology of the country,

35
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,480
a country that believed in stories about
how the world works.

36
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,480
That I as a nerd thought,
obviously not quite true.

37
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,500
I had difficulty believing the official
stories about how the world works.

38
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,150
It was like some weird kind of religion.
And then the wall came down and it

39
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:24,750
didn't surprise me in the least.
And then we entered a new dream,

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,120
a new shared,
a model of the world.

41
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:30,360
It was not quite true.
And I realized that most people now fall

42
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:33,060
for this new model.
It was very interesting for to see if

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,580
it's for me.
And um,

44
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,330
if you look for instance,
at the u s the majority of us Americans

45
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:41,220
do not believe in the theory of
evolution.

46
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,590
Despite all the evidence to the
contrary.

47
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,830
Uh,
the majority of people are on this

48
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:50,040
planet are religious,
even though that doesn't seem to be very

49
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:54,090
good evidence for a multitude of Creator
Gods and so on,

50
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,050
in my view,
at least.

51
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,670
And if it existed,
if a creator God exists,

52
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,640
it would be very hard for me to why this
creator,

53
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:03,970
God really does care about whether I
worship it or,

54
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,030
um,
um,

55
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,070
all these things that we attribute to
create God's fire religion.

56
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,530
So it's,
it's very hard for me in some sense to

57
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:16,531
intuitively understand why humans are
religious invite humans are ideological.

58
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,800
But I think now over the years,
um,

59
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,690
that this is not a bug.
It's a feature.

60
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,530
Humans are a programmable species.
Religions and ideologies are operating

61
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:33,841
systems for societies and they have been
so throughout most of our history and

62
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:37,870
this idea that we can build society
based on rational arguments is very,

63
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:39,280
very recent and very novel.

64
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,860
And it's not entirely clear if it really
works,

65
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,660
but it's clear that we cannot really
build societies on conflicting

66
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:48,640
ideologies that are at war with each
other.

67
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,500
In the past that has led to situations
where the ideology solve the problems by

68
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:56,620
killing the unbelievers or their
religions did the same thing.

69
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,900
And we all agree this is not what you
want to have.

70
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:03,190
We want to have an open society,
pluralistic society and nonviolent

71
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,550
tolerance society,
but still one where people work together

72
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:10,720
and cooperate.
That and this ability to wake up into a

73
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:14,230
shared dream in which people believe
things because their neighbors believe

74
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:17,910
them has been a very powerful feature.
That's probably the reason vive,

75
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,930
you were able to build our scale
societies.

76
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,110
We have to understand that when people
cooperate,

77
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,900
they're very often in what we call a
prisoner's dilemma,

78
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,680
a situation.
And in order to achieve the greatest

79
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:31,480
good,
you have to give up something for

80
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,330
yourself,
even as in a situation where that is in

81
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:35,680
some sense a bit irrational.

82
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,830
Because if everybody else is not doing
it,

83
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,490
you're going to be worse off.
And for these prisoners,

84
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,031
Sal,
I must be,

85
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:46,000
have various solutions.
The easiest solution is to have a

86
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:48,640
reputation system.
You basically keep track of who did what

87
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:51,310
when,
and you make sure that only the good

88
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:52,144
guys,
uh,

89
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,040
get cookies in the future.
And the problem is that these reputation

90
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,800
systems do not scale.
If you have too many people in your

91
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:03,670
tribe or your family or in your village,
you just lose track of who did what

92
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,610
when.
And you cannot really synchronize it by

93
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:08,080
our talking about it.
So after a couple of hundred

94
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:10,660
individuals,
the reputation system doesn't work very

95
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:14,200
well.
It also doesn't really work if you are

96
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,260
not looking.
So if nobody is doing this surveillance,

97
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,160
um,
how do you make sure that nobody is

98
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,930
affecting and stealing stuff from the
fridge of your tribe?

99
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,150
Right?
So,

100
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,380
um,
what do we do?

101
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,710
We evolve the ability to be normative.
The ability or the need to be good and

102
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,990
this need to be good.
This need to follow internalized norms.

103
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,140
This need to serve sacred principles is
something that is probably a feature

104
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,060
that is ingrained into our genetic
makeup.

105
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,230
And of course this alone would not be
good enough because goodness is like an

106
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,280
arbitrary vector and value space.
People also have a need to synchronize

107
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:54,760
what's good.
So people will try to feel what's good

108
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:59,180
in their ingroup.
It works by empathy is the primary mode

109
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:02,300
in which we transmit norms.
If you dress up somebody as an

110
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:03,620
authority,
as a priest,

111
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,280
as a professor,
as a pop star is a politician and this

112
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:11,240
person says a certain thing was
conviction and people see that,

113
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:13,370
others believe it,
they start leaving it themselves.

114
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,590
And it's obviously very useful to do
this.

115
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,150
There's almost never a situation where
it's useful to have an opinion that is

116
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:25,151
different from the opinion of your boss.
So this is the ability that we got.

117
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:30,290
And it means that people perform the
same things that they have followed the

118
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,780
same rules regardless of the size of the
group.

119
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,590
And this makes it possible to build
agricultural societies.

120
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,560
There's hundreds of thousands of
individuals and then millions of

121
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:41,600
individuals.
It makes it possible that this

122
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:45,650
agricultural society has people that
specialized on different fruits and

123
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,400
different traits and different materials
and different crafts and so on and

124
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:55,880
produce all the multitude of tasks and
tools that we need to get an

125
00:06:55,881 --> 00:07:00,881
agricultural society to run and be able
to outcompete the nomadic societies.

126
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,950
And I think the reason by Homo Sapians
is the only hominid species that's left

127
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:10,010
us because we out competed them all.
We were in the same competitive niche

128
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,050
and be various species that was
programmable.

129
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:14,220
There was able to coordinate arbitrary
logical,

130
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:17,810
buff individuals.
That was very powerful.

131
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,040
It just turns out that this mode of
tribal organization is not sufficient

132
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,510
for the world that we live in now.

133
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:24,980
Mm.
