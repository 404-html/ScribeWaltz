1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,550
He currently,
I'm a professor of biology at Mit.

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,050
Gee.
Um,

3
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,470
I was actually more inclined towards,
uh,

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,720
chemistry,
maybe mathematics,

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,220
uh,
than biology.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,093
In fact,
in high school I never studied biology 

7
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:31,690
at all because I found it much too soft 
as a science.

8
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,093
Uh,
then it was a characterization of a 

9
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,350
taxonomy and species and phylon stuff 
that I find it totally boring.

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,980
But in college,
uh,

11
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:48,010
at Mit when I was a freshman,
I was planning to major in,

12
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,930
uh,
possibly chemistry.

13
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,771
But,
uh,

14
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:51,604
I learned that there was this new thing 
called molecular biology that was just 

15
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:58,240
emerging and that was,
it was very exciting.

16
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,480
So I decided to try it out.
And,

17
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:02,314
uh,
I ended up majoring in biology a while 

18
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:07,330
taking a lot of chemistry courses.
And,

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,193
uh,
I think it was probably a very good 

20
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:10,834
decision because I think the life 
science has really have blossomed 

21
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:15,640
tremendously in the past 10,
20,

22
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:16,474
30 years.
And this is really the golden age now 

23
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:19,204
for biology.

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,783
That came a little bit later.
So I had been on the faculty at Mit for 

25
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:30,480
about six,
seven years.

26
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:32,610
I had tenure and,
uh,

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,620
it gave me an opportunity to think about
doing something a little bit risky,

28
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,900
uh,
sort of high risk,

29
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,003
high reward.
And I spent several years thinking what 

30
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:49,161
are some problems out there in biology 
now that would fit into that category.

31
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,630
And,
uh,

32
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,490
I thought about a lot of things,
uh,

33
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,880
including learning and memory.
And I thought aging was,

34
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:57,714
was interesting because obviously it's 
an extremely important and it wasn't 

35
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,453
being studied systematically.
It was being studied from the point of 

36
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:06,930
view of,
uh,

37
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,760
comparing old and young,
uh,

38
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,870
and mainly in the medical community.
But in terms of the aging process itself

39
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,500
and moreover,
what might control the aging process?

40
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,000
There wasn't very much,
no,

41
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,830
it was a little bit known,
but not much.

42
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,470
So it looked like a perfect opportunity.
Uh,

43
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:27,720
but one that,
that had considerable risk.

44
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,940
What made me decide to actually,
uh,

45
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,210
get into it is it turned out so my lab 
was at that point,

46
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,470
uh,
studying,

47
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,420
uh,
the organism yeast.

48
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,703
And I was a,
a yeast biologists and we had studied 

49
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:47,070
various aspects of cell and molecular 
biology in yeast.

50
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:51,000
And that's really what gained me tenure 
at Mit.

51
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,330
And it turned out that yeast cells get 
old they age.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,200
So this was a,
for me,

53
00:02:58,201 --> 00:02:59,034
a perfect entry point to the problem.
We could begin by studying how yeast 

54
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:05,950
cells get old.
And that's what we did.

55
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,510
Now we started,
uh,

56
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,360
uh,
bashing away at this problem,

57
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,950
uh,
in yeast,

58
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,340
uh,
with the idea that we could find genes,

59
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,174
single genes that could confer extra 
longevity to yeast cells that are 

60
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:26,380
dividing.
So when you cells divide,

61
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,713
uh,
this is Baker's yeast that I'm talking 

62
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:31,780
about.
The kind of Iste would use to make bread

63
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,590
or wine or spirits.
And it turns out they're very,

64
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,870
very good system to study in the 
laboratory,

65
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,880
uh,
to look at cell biology.

66
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,190
Now when these cells divide what you 
get,

67
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,550
interestingly of course you get two 
salads from one cell,

68
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,713
but they're different.
One is called the mother cell and it's 

69
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:51,040
big and the other is called the daughter
cell.

70
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,053
And it's small.
And it turns out the daughter cell is 

71
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,993
all newly synthesized,
all the material and the daughter is 

72
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:58,234
new,
but the mother cell retains the old 

73
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:01,240
stuff.

74
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,073
So that mother cell will then give 
another daughter and another daughter 

75
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,124
and every generation it will be getting 
older and it does that about 20 times 

76
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:12,400
and then it hits the wall and 
Senescence.

77
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:13,720
Okay.
So that,

78
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,630
so it really,
uh,

79
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:16,570
they're really was aging.
I'll be in,

80
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:17,404
in a a very baroque system.
So we thought we would be able to make 

81
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:22,204
some headway potentially and identifying
at least what controls this process in 

82
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:27,154
this,
uh,

83
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,240
uh,
exotic,

84
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,243
uh,
system.

85
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,170
And that's really what intrigued me.
I had,

86
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,053
uh,
uh,

87
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,390
at that point,
uh,

88
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,283
no,
uh,

89
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,133
uh,
plan to study aging more generally then 

90
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:42,760
yeast that came as we got deeper and 
deeper into the problem.

91
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,160
Well,
I think the problem,

92
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,001
uh,
yes,

93
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:49,834
I think the problem with this field and 
what has bedeviled this field over the 

94
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,443
years is false claims.
And there are all kinds of things that 

95
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:01,580
have been claimed about,
uh,

96
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,870
uh,
ways you can slow down or stop aging.

97
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,620
And what I would say they have in common
is that,

98
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,300
you know,
and until,

99
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,350
uh,
anything,

100
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,060
uh,
that was claimed,

101
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,360
that's not based on very recent science 
is not true.

102
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,430
It's Baloney.
And,

103
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:20,740
um,
so I wouldn't believe any claim,

104
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,410
uh,
of an anti aging procedure,

105
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,760
uh,
and,

106
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,953
uh,
uh,

107
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,793
would really look at claims that are 
grounded in current science because I 

108
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:36,361
think the science of aging has really 
only taken off in the past decade and it

109
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,073
has reached a level of quality that you 
can trust it and that it would lead to 

110
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,020
interventions that would actually work.
That's only happened recently.

111
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,210
So the,
the thing to look at it,

112
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,140
any claim like this vitamin or that 
treatment or that,

113
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,080
uh,
uh,

114
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,520
bath,
whatever it may be or cream,

115
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,743
is,
is it based on the recent science of 

116
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,180
aging or not?
And if it's not,

117
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,270
I would tend not to believe it.
Even if it is,

118
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:12,140
I would look at whether it's based on 
good science or not.

119
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:15,230
But there is some good science now in 
the area of aging.

120
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,910
No,
no,

121
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:21,210
I think that,
uh,

122
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,920
what they're saying is,
it's a good example.

123
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,980
I think of something that's not based on
a recent science in the field of aging.

124
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,150
And so,
uh,

125
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,130
you know,
I,

126
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,910
I don't think that there's any reason to
believe that it's true.

127
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,460
I mean,
it may turn out that it is true.

128
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,323
I mean his basic ideas,
we're going to make incremental 

129
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:43,844
discoveries in agent that will make us 
live a little bit longer and give us a 

130
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:50,150
little bit more time to make the next 
discovery,

131
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,343
which will make us live still longer and
then we'll make more discoveries and so 

132
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:57,290
on and so on and so on and so on.
Um,

133
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,940
and uh,
you know,

134
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,430
that would be great,
but,

135
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,920
uh,
that's certainly not scientific thinking

136
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:04,754
and that's not based on current science.
So I think that what we're talking 

137
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:10,034
about,
if you look at all the genetic 

138
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:16,691
interventions that have been described 
and we should really get into discussing

139
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,680
some of that in a few minutes and all 
the dietary interventions that have been

140
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:24,640
described that promote longevity,
uh,

141
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,770
what you looking at is something like a 
50% as a maximum extension?

142
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,150
I would,
I would think so.

143
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,610
It's nothing to sneeze at and,
uh,

144
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,650
it's,
we think,

145
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,370
uh,
accompanied by an increase in the number

146
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,203
of years we stay healthy.
And if we can tap into that and even 

147
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,760
develop it so that we get some of the 
benefits,

148
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,370
let's say,
10 years of healthier living.

149
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,390
So instead of having to retire and,
uh,

150
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,873
stop,
uh,

151
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,360
functioning at a high level,
at age 70 or 75,

152
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,260
you push that back now 10 years.
I think that's a,

153
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:06,810
a major,
uh,

154
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,280
change in our society aging process.
Uh,

155
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,180
you can describe it statistically in 
terms of,

156
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,000
uh,
mortality curves.

157
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,010
And,
uh,

158
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,400
what that means is that the probability 
of dying increases,

159
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,320
uh,
with your age.

160
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,543
And the reason is that there's a 
degenerative process that's occurring 

161
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,230
and cells and tissues that makes,
uh,

162
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:36,950
you,
uh,

163
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,330
increasingly less robust as you get 
older and,

164
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,650
uh,
opens up the doors to diseases of aging,

165
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,600
the major diseases,
diabetes,

166
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,360
Alzheimer's disease,
cancer,

167
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,930
cardiovascular disease,
osteoporosis,

168
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,520
and,
uh,

169
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,030
you know,
eventually will kill you.

170
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,260
So,
uh,

171
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,660
it's a very pervasive,
uh,

172
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,230
uh,
process that has many,

173
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,860
many things going wrong all at the same 
time.

174
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,810
Well,
you're,

175
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,790
you're talking to somebody who is,
uh,

176
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,500
not unbiased,
uh,

177
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,400
in this area.
And,

178
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,420
um,
you know,

179
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:21,780
I think the search villains have really 
been to my mind,

180
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,170
uh,
but a completely unexpected,

181
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,770
a new thing to come along.
Now,

182
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,490
this came from the studies and yeast 
that I described a few minutes ago where

183
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:35,334
we were looking for aging genes.
And after about nine years of doing 

184
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:42,204
this,
the first nine years we started working 

185
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:45,174
in this area about 19 years ago,
the first nine years were spent in 

186
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:51,660
yeast.
I'm trying to find the right Jean.

187
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:55,620
And we came upon a gene called cert two 
and cert two,

188
00:09:55,621 --> 00:10:00,621
gene was an anti aging gene.
And what I mean by that is when you made

189
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:04,170
it more active,
the cells live longer,

190
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,890
they divided more times when you made it
less active,

191
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,760
they lived less long.
So this looked like a really interesting

192
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:15,600
gene and it was the only gene that we 
came across that did this.

193
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,110
And so,
so we thought it was interesting.

194
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,290
Then we carried out a similar kind of 
study,

195
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,153
uh,
in a different organism that people 

196
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:28,470
study in the lab,
the roundworm see Alec Gans.

197
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,770
And again,
we're looking are there any genes in the

198
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:36,771
genome c elegans that are anti aging 
genes and we've got the same gene.

199
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,130
We got a gene that has the same 
sequence,

200
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,993
similar sequence as the cert too.
So that's an amazing finding because 

201
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,273
what it means is if the Sir two gene is 
counteracting aging in yeast and in 

202
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:53,394
worms that it's doing that universally 
and that would include mammals and it 

203
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:57,684
would include us.
So it really right away speaks to a 

204
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:01,554
universality of this process.
So I think that's one thing that's 

205
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:06,234
highly significant about this is that 
the gene is conserved and we think its 

206
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,950
effect on the aging process is 
concerned.

207
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,690
Now,
the piece of this that makes it,

208
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:21,510
I think particularly exciting as you 
say,

209
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:22,201
well,
okay,

210
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:24,420
there's this gene,
uh,

211
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,470
that,
uh,

212
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,680
makes you live longer.
If it's more active,

213
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:29,851
why,
why,

214
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:32,880
why should that be?
What does this gene actually do?

215
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,230
Okay.
And what we know is genes of course,

216
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,123
are the blueprint to specify proteins 
and the Sir two genes and code 

217
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,230
particular proteins,
the proteins are called Sirtuin.

218
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,800
Okay.
And we're really,

219
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,830
really eager to try and figure out what 
the cert actually dead in Sal's.

220
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:01,140
And just almost exactly 10 years ago,
a little bit more than 10 years ago,

221
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,840
we discovered it and they have an 
enzymatic activity in south that enables

222
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,863
them to modify other proteins in cells 
and that can really change the 

223
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:15,220
metabolism,
the physiology of a cell,

224
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,410
and then by extension of entire tissues 
and an entire organism.

225
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,573
But the critical thing about this 
activity is that it was completely 

226
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:29,941
coupled to this small metabolic molecule
in cells called Nad.

227
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,953
So the activity of cert tunes,
which is called deacetylation of other 

228
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:40,360
proteins is absolutely under control of 
Nad.

229
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,660
No Nad sort tunes are dead.
Okay.

230
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,900
So the naed links started two wins,
two diet and metabolism because diet and

231
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:53,230
metabolism affect the availability of 
Ned in south.

232
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,663
So we came up with a hypothesis 10 years
ago when we discovered this activity 

233
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,173
that Serotonin's might be really be the 
link between how diet affects how long 

234
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:13,720
you live and how diet affects your 
predisposition to diseases.

235
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,101
And this is a,
it was,

236
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:15,934
uh,
uh,

237
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,153
I think a radical idea.
I think there are a lot of people out 

238
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:22,810
there still critical,
don't believe it.

239
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,470
Um,
but I think the data is mountain in mice

240
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,290
particularly that says that this may 
actually be true.

241
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,270
And so the idea would be uh,
that on a low calorie diet,

242
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,700
a diet that's been term calorie 
restriction,

243
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,260
we know that rodents live longer and 
they resist diseases,

244
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:46,261
they're disease free under this diet.
And we suggest that the reason for that,

245
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:50,770
at least one of the reasons,
one of the main reasons is that this low

246
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:51,604
calorie diet activate Sirtuin,
it's via this molecule nad and that the 

247
00:13:57,221 --> 00:13:58,054
more active cert tunes then promote 
better survival and better ability to 

248
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:03,880
ward off diseases.

249
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,133
So that's a very simple,
a hypothesis that came from identifying 

250
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:12,040
this activity that I mentioned.
So that's one.

251
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:12,903
The second thing that came out of that 
is once you have an understanding of 

252
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,374
what a protein does,
and you can actually measure that in a 

253
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:23,854
test tube.
Now that just has that protein and in 

254
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:27,394
this case Nad at enabled you to screen 
for drugs for small molecules that can 

255
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:32,584
enhance that activity.
And it opened the door for looking for 

256
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,790
small molecules that could upregulate 
the activity of [inaudible].

257
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,640
And that's led to sort of a,
a flood of,

258
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,380
uh,
of interest.

259
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:51,860
I think probably the part of the story 
that's gotten the greatest notice in the

260
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:52,694
press.
So the first screens that were done 

261
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,990
identified a molecule found in red wine 
called resveratrol.

262
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:05,330
That's of a class of compounds that 
plants make and response to stress.

263
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:06,620
They're called polyphenols.

264
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,700
And these compounds could activate,
uh,

265
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,983
the search doing in a test tube and they
also could make cells live longer east 

266
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:21,601
cells and could make worms live longer.
So the remarkable thing,

267
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,173
uh,
seem to be that not only our cert tunes 

268
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,113
able to do this,
but we might actually be able to 

269
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:29,640
influence their activity,
uh,

270
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,850
from outside with drugs.
And that really is a,

271
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,910
I think where the,
uh,

272
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,833
excitement began.
And it's still a building because I 

273
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:41,360
think if this is still not completely 
appreciate it yet,

274
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,763
so that was,
these are natural products that 

275
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,120
resveratrol and uh,
the polyphenols,

276
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:47,954
the things that are found in wine.
But a company was started by David 

277
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,480
Sinclair and Christof Westfall called 
Sirtris about,

278
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,433
uh,
six years ago to try and look for new 

279
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:03,320
kinds of molecules now that are not a 
natural products.

280
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:04,154
They're not found in nature by screening
through libraries of different chemical 

281
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:08,354
compounds that have been synthesized.
And there are new kinds of activators 

282
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:15,800
now of cert two wins,
new chemicals that can activate the much

283
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:16,634
more potently than risk very trial.
And it's going to be extremely exciting 

284
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,540
to test these molecules and see what 
they'll do.

285
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,403
So far,
what we know is both resveratrol and 

286
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:32,120
some of these newer compounds,
uh,

287
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:36,590
have beneficial effects in mice and what
they do in minds.

288
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:39,800
They've been tested against various 
diseases.

289
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:44,480
So what we would expect is if these 
molecules are really activating sirtuins

290
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,240
and can protect against diseases of 
aging,

291
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,880
then we should be able to demonstrate 
that in a mouse.

292
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,060
So it turns out if you feed a mouse,
uh,

293
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:53,923
basically a bad diet,
the opposite of a calorie restricted 

294
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:58,370
diet.
So a diet high in fat,

295
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,910
high in calories,
the mice get diabetes,

296
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,553
okay?
Now it turns out these molecules 

297
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:10,100
resveratrol and the newer compounds that
activate the cert two wins,

298
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,860
they can protect the mouse against 
diabetes.

299
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,940
So the mouse will still eat a lot.
The mouse will still even get fat.

300
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,270
Okay.
But we'll stay metabolically healthy.

301
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,240
So that's a pretty good demonstration 
that,

302
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,000
uh,
this idea is not so far out,

303
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,193
uh,
but that there really is an opportunity 

304
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:34,211
here to use drugs to keep metabolism 
strong and intact as in the face of,

305
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,940
uh,
uh,

306
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,520
caloric excess.

307
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,950
Okay.
But even more importantly,

308
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,460
for many of us,
like myself who already,

309
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,180
uh,
I don't calorie restrict,

310
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:49,590
but I don't eat to access either,
so I'm in good shape,

311
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,760
but even someone like myself would be 
able to get benefit from these,

312
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,743
uh,
these molecules by activating sirtuins 

313
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,890
in addition to the benefit that I'm 
already getting,

314
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,040
my keeping myself in good shape.
So I think it's very,

315
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,240
uh,
it's a very promising area of research.

316
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,990
And this company,
the small company called [inaudible] was

317
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:14,220
bought by one of the giants in the 
pharmaceutical industry.

318
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:19,170
She asked k for something like three 
quarters of $1 billion a year ago.

319
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,590
So obviously that,
uh,

320
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,733
there's at least some validation in big 
Pharma that these ideas are realistic 

321
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,740
and will be brought to fruition.

322
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,380
I think,
well,

323
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,253
you know,
my lab works on really uncertain ruins 

324
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,280
and I think with,
there's so much to be done.

325
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,390
So what we know now is just as the tip 
of the iceberg about Sir tones.

326
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,200
So first of all,
there are seven of them in people.

327
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,550
Okay.
And so far,

328
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:53,340
most of the studies have been focused on
just one of those seven.

329
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,833
Second of all,
there are many tissues that have to be 

330
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,374
studied.
So we know what the cert two winds are 

331
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:03,620
doing in each and every tissue so that 
we know what the effects of the drug are

332
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,010
going to be,
tissue by tissue.

333
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,710
Uh,
and that's gonna take a long time.

334
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,070
So we're deeply involved in that.
The third thing is,

335
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,173
will these cert two to really protect 
against many diseases or will they just 

336
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:19,680
protect against metabolic diseases like 
diabetes?

337
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,873
So my lab is really focused focus now on
neurodegenerative diseases and we're 

338
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:28,950
testing the effect of activating,
uh,

339
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,030
the,
the major,

340
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,093
uh,
human cert two in which is called 

341
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,250
[inaudible]. [inaudible]
has also been called the survival gene.

342
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,063
Uh,
and we're interested in what if we 

343
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:38,844
activate this and the brain,
will it protect the mouse against 

344
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,390
Alzheimer's disease,
against Parkinson's disease,

345
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,433
against Huntington's disease.
And I think these are extremely 

346
00:19:48,781 --> 00:19:52,590
important questions because that will 
define the sculpt of,

347
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,443
uh,
what we're able to think about here and 

348
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,770
what we can start to attack 
pharmacologically.

349
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,241
Well,
I mean,

350
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:06,300
I think a low calorie diet is probably a
good thing.

351
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,080
Um,
I think in humans,

352
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:10,914
we don't know.
There's no data on what a low calorie 

353
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:16,800
diet does in terms of diseases and,
uh,

354
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,510
longevity,
as I said before,

355
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,510
uh,
by analogy to rodents,

356
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,423
uh,
you would think it would be a good 

357
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,150
thing.
On the other hand,

358
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,390
uh,
if it made you really miserable to eat a

359
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,230
thousand calories a day,
uh,

360
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,590
and people who are on that diet tend to 
be cold.

361
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,080
They tend to,
uh,

362
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,340
have a very low sex drive.
They tend to,

363
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,310
uh,
in some cases be irritable.

364
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,563
And so if you're not happy,
then that gets back to what we were 

365
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:48,040
saying earlier.
You may be undoing some of the good,

366
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,421
uh,
that,

367
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:50,460
that diet,
uh,

368
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
would otherwise produce.
So my feeling is to live sense of way.

369
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:00,940
I mean the work,
what advice that I think is good.

370
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,580
It's hard to follow,
but I think what everybody should do,

371
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,600
if everybody could do this,
uh,

372
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,573
it's,
it's the best you can do right now is 

373
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,510
decide what is your perfect weight,
your body weight,

374
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,900
what's perfect for you.
And I think what most people do is rifle

375
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,630
through the past and,
and,

376
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,620
and,
and the side,

377
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:21,071
and,
you know,

378
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:25,960
when they were most happy with 
themselves and do everything possible to

379
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:29,230
get to that weight and keep to it.
And I think that that would,

380
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,193
uh,
uh,

381
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,870
necessarily,
uh,

382
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,170
make you healthier,
most people healthier than they are now.

383
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,030
Uh,
beyond that,

384
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:38,830
I,
you know,

385
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,230
I take a vitamin supplement,
a general supplement,

386
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,930
uh,
I take vitamin D,

387
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,320
um,
I do not take resveratrol.

388
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,700
They'll,
a lot of people do.

389
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:53,680
Um,
and the reason is I'm waiting for a 100%

390
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,720
pure and reliable source of it and then 
I will take it.

391
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,020
Um,
and uh,

392
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,070
I drink a little wine and uh,
all the data says,

393
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,840
again,
there's an optimum,

394
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,810
I think the data says that too much wine
is bad,

395
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,100
but no wine is not optima.
The right amount of wine,

396
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
uh,
is optimum theirs up center in Louisiana

397
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:25,060
called the Pennington Center that has 
been,

398
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,260
uh,
doing such studies.

399
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,094
It's been a long time since there's been
good data on humans on a calorie 

400
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:33,970
restriction.
And part of the problem has been that,

401
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,510
uh,
humans tend to cheat on the Diet.

402
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,140
So a controlled studies end up not being
so controlled.

403
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,533
Uh,
but recently there have been six months 

404
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:47,980
studies done and what you can do in six 
months,

405
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:49,930
you can't ask if it's making people live
longer.

406
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:52,450
You can't even ask if it's protecting 
them against diseases,

407
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,673
but you can't ask if it's eliciting the 
kinds of physiological changes that you 

408
00:22:58,481 --> 00:23:02,410
expect in calorie restriction,
which would be a loss of body fat,

409
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,080
a lowering of blood glucose.

410
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,050
It's an antidiabetic,
uh,

411
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:11,980
effect,
a rendering of a sensitivity to insulin,

412
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,960
the action of insulin.
These can all be measured and six months

413
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:16,794
in calorie restriction and humans,
that's roughly the same thing that it 

414
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:21,100
does in mice.
Now,

415
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:25,090
just one footnote on one of those 
studies.

416
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,210
So in rodents,
uh,

417
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,630
what we knew is that,
uh,

418
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,043
some of these sirtuin activators could 
activate a muscle to process glucose 

419
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:40,690
better.
And it was doing that,

420
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,610
at least in part by activating,
uh,

421
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:47,870
the synthesis of these are organelles 
and cells.

422
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,880
They're called the powerhouses of south 
that make energy for sounds.

423
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,330
And by activating Mitochondria,
uh,

424
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,413
you sort of drive metabolism and you 
drive the uptake of glucose from the 

425
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:02,090
blood into the muscle and the processing
of glucose.

426
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:04,040
So it's a good thing.
It's an antidiabetic thing.

427
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,970
And this process is,
uh,

428
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,120
can be driven by certain one survival 
gene in muscle,

429
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,320
in rodents.

430
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,770
Now,
it was done first with resveratrol,

431
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:18,770
but it turns out calorie restriction in 
rodents does the same thing.

432
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:22,130
You activate the synthesis of 
Mitochondria in muscle.

433
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,443
Okay.
And that makes them more metabolically 

434
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:27,860
active and it's a good thing 
metabolically.

435
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,750
Okay.
Not to get back to the humans.

436
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,730
What they were able to show,
uh,

437
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:32,564
and this trial is they took a punch 
biopsies of muscle from the people that 

438
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:39,920
were on the calorie restriction diet for
six months.

439
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,783
And what they found in their muscles was
an increase in Mitochondria and an 

440
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,750
increase in the levels of the SAR t one 
protein.

441
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,110
The protein was actually increased,
uh,

442
00:24:51,111 --> 00:24:53,240
and the muscle in response to calorie 
restriction.

443
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,930
So that says that the congruence 
between,

444
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,003
uh,
uh,

445
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,580
mice and humans,
maybe a,

446
00:25:00,581 --> 00:25:03,650
a quite profound with regard to calorie 
restriction.

447
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,543
So we can't say any,
there's no direct evidence in humans 

448
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:09,860
about diseases,
certainly not about lifespan,

449
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,190
but at least basic physiology.
Uh,

450
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,173
uh,
looks like it might be similar in 

451
00:25:16,011 --> 00:25:18,710
humans.
So that might not make a good prediction

452
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,120
about the effects of calorie 
restriction,

453
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,960
but nobody wants to practice calorie 
restriction because it's,

454
00:25:25,961 --> 00:25:26,794
it's so unpleasant.
And so what everybody would like as a 

455
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,253
mimetic,
a drug that would elicit at least some 

456
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:34,880
of the benefits of calorie restriction.

457
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,450
Well,
I would say,

458
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,180
uh,
smoking would be one,

459
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,910
uh,
eating to caloric excess.

460
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:47,690
Okay.

461
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,530
Would be another.

462
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,893
MMM.

463
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,800
Being Sedentary.

464
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:53,680
Okay.

465
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,660
Uh,
not moving around,

466
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:59,680
not exercising would be a third.
We didn't talk about exercise,

467
00:25:59,681 --> 00:26:04,510
but there's ample evidence that exercise
is beneficial.

468
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,303
Um,
I think the other thing is what we were 

469
00:26:08,591 --> 00:26:11,350
just talking about,
your attitude and mindset.

470
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,273
I think,
you know,

471
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,653
uh,
being focused on negativity would be a 

472
00:26:16,631 --> 00:26:19,510
fourth.
And I think the last one,

473
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,000
uh,
which again is,

474
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:22,840
would,
would be,

475
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,703
uh,
more or less than this lifestyle area 

476
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:27,963
would be stress level,
that level of stress that you maintain 

477
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,310
on a day to day basis.
So I believe in it.

478
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,090
Others,
uh,

479
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,313
believe in something called hormesis.
And what horn me this means is that a 

480
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:49,550
lot of stress is a bad thing,
but no,

481
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:50,384
stress is also a bad thing.
And the optimum is something in the 

482
00:26:55,231 --> 00:26:59,400
middle so that you're engaged on a daily
basis.

483
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,880
You're revved up your functioning.
Okay.

484
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,560
But you feel as though you're in 
control.

485
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,260
And I think finding that balance,
that horn he says,

486
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,593
uh,
is,

487
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,463
is probably very important in 
maintaining mental health and physical 

488
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:16,110
health.
So that would be my,

489
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,180
my big five.
Well,

490
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,860
I would say,
uh,

491
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,990
smoking would be one.

492
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:26,590
Okay.

493
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,710
Uh,
eating to caloric excess.

494
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,490
Okay.

495
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,360
Would be another,

496
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,723
mmm.

497
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,620
Being Sedentary.

498
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,470
Okay.

499
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,450
Uh,
not moving around,

500
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:42,470
not exercising would be a third.
We didn't talk about exercise,

501
00:27:42,471 --> 00:27:47,310
but there's ample evidence that exercise
is beneficial.

502
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,143
MMM.

503
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,300
I think the other thing is what we were 
just talking about,

504
00:27:52,301 --> 00:27:54,610
your attitude and mindset.
I think,

505
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,050
you know,
uh,

506
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:00,010
being focused on negativity would be a 
fourth.

507
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,280
And I think the last one,
uh,

508
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,050
which again is,
would,

509
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,100
would be,
uh,

510
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:11,460
more or less than this lifestyle area 
would be stress level,

511
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,970
that level of stress that you maintain 
on a day to day basis.

512
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,120
So I believe in it.
Others,

513
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:24,340
uh,
believe in something called hormesis and

514
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:29,791
what harm me,
so this means is that a lot of stress is

515
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:32,350
a bad thing,
but no,

516
00:28:32,351 --> 00:28:33,184
stress is also a bad thing.
And the optimum is something in the 

517
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:42,220
middle so that you're engaged on a daily
basis.

518
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,700
You're revved up your functioning,
okay.

519
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,380
But you feel as though you're in 
control.

520
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:51,040
And I think finding that balance,
that warm he says,

521
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,383
uh,
is,

522
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,810
is probably very important in 
maintaining,

523
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,550
uh,
mental health and physical health.

524
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,890
So that would be my,
my big five.

525
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,110
I think that at least for the aging 
field,

526
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,150
uh,
one,

527
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:13,230
uh,
disappointment I would say that I've had

528
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:18,710
is that aging is fundamental to so many 
diseases.

529
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:25,710
Yet I really think it's,
it's underfunded in terms of,

530
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,530
uh,
an approach to treating these diseases.

531
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,160
And,
uh,

532
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,690
to give you an example,
I think the past 10 to 20 years has been

533
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:34,524
an amazing time in the field of aging,
but the fraction of the NIH budget that 

534
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:46,180
goes to research on aging hasn't changed
over that period.

535
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,950
And,
um,

536
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:51,880
to me that's disappointing because I 
think that,

537
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,770
that this is a,
a one,

538
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:57,160
a leverage point to really improve human
health.

539
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,880
I'm not sure anything is overfunded,
to be perfectly honest.

540
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,440
Uh,
you know,

541
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,060
I,
I think,

542
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,760
uh,
leads most major areas,

543
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,170
uh,
of research,

544
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,510
uh,
that I know of are meritorious.

545
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,160
And,
uh,

546
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,380
you know,
if you review grants,

547
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,580
uh,
usually,

548
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,103
uh,
the number of grants you see that are 

549
00:30:22,271 --> 00:30:26,890
worthy of funding far exceeds the number
that actually get funded.

550
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,340
So,
you know,

551
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,173
I,
I'm not saying I realize it's a 

552
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,150
ultimately a zero sum game,
but,

553
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,013
um,
I do think that aging in particular 

554
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,260
probably,
uh,

555
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:43,310
is a little bit underfunded now.
I think the US has always been,

556
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,930
uh,
the best country in terms of encouraging

557
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,490
innovation.
And I think,

558
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:51,930
you know,
the,

559
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,763
the,
the rise of the NIH and the granting 

560
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,110
system,
uh,

561
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:00,100
after a world war two to now,
uh,

562
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,150
as is a really good example of that.
And I know when I was a young scientist,

563
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,073
uh,
you know,

564
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,913
people would apply for grants and they 
weren't so hard to get the fraction 

565
00:31:10,421 --> 00:31:13,810
funded maybe was 25%,
something like that.

566
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,470
And so that you could propose things 
that were a little bit,

567
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,413
uh,
out of the box and have a chance of 

568
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:24,970
getting funded to do it,
which encourages innovation.

569
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,120
I think.
Now once things become,

570
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,070
uh,
so tight and instead of 25%,

571
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:37,120
you have 10% of grants funded,
then I think,

572
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:37,691
you know,
any,

573
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:42,250
any grant that seems the least bit risky
is not going to be funded.

574
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,760
And I think,
uh,

575
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,000
you tend to encourage,
uh,

576
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,190
sort of precise,
uh,

577
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,220
calculated,
uh,

578
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,330
science,
uh,

579
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,253
at the expense of creative science.
So historically this country has been 

580
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:56,944
the best.
I think I'm a little concerned now that 

581
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:02,800
that might be a trailing off,
although I can't,

582
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,993
uh,
uh,

583
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,000
offhand tell you that it's better.
Any other place.

584
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,330
I think one hero I would mention,
uh,

585
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,410
has Galileo and the re and recent for 
that.

586
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,410
And the reason I think least to my mind,
uh,

587
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:25,470
he's the greatest scientist is it,
the way we do science now is to actually

588
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:32,800
have ideas that we can test with 
experiments.

589
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,560
And it's this,
it's called the scientific methods.

590
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:41,390
So critical to making more than 
philosophy.

591
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,490
And I think in earlier civilizations,
the Greeks,

592
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:48,020
the Romans,
the greatest minds,

593
00:32:48,021 --> 00:32:50,170
the philosophers,
uh,

594
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,160
they just sort of intuited things,
you know,

595
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,170
here's the way things must be.
Uh,

596
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,513
and of course,
that's a recipe for making a lot of 

597
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:06,161
mistakes and for having a,
a false impression of the world.

598
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,530
And we go away,
oh dead was to say,

599
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:11,120
okay,
I have an idea.

600
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:15,920
But I think the way to go is to do 
experiments and uh,

601
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,410
to test the ideas.
And that I think is,

602
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,390
is the bedrock upon which a modern 
science has built.

603
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:25,843
Also.
I mean,

604
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,440
uh,
he,

605
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,230
he took a lot of heat for what he did in
his lifetime,

606
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,980
uh,
from the Catholic Church and uh,

607
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,180
and he was operating under a pretty 
extreme circumstances.

608
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,820
And given those circumstances,
I think he performed pretty darn well.

609
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:51,210
I think one dilemma you always have is,
um,

610
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,303
our profession really depends on our 
being able to publish our work in peer 

611
00:33:59,401 --> 00:34:01,920
review journals.
So what gets published,

612
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,780
it's really been,
uh,

613
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,840
gone over with a fine tooth comb.
And so we review each other's papers and

614
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:15,810
you have to decide when you have a 
conflict of interest or not.

615
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,290
And if someone's work is too close to 
yours,

616
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,333
if they're a competitor,
I think you have to stay away from it 

617
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,930
because there's an obvious conflict of 
interest,

618
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,330
a little bit less obvious.
Uh,

619
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,660
if you have people,
uh,

620
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,553
who's,
uh,

621
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,880
the people whose papers,
uh,

622
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:38,130
who wrote the papers are from your lab,
they're former postdocs or students.

623
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,580
I think that's also a conflict of 
interest.

624
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,290
And I think it's an,
uh,

625
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:43,880
it's,
uh,

626
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,060
uh,
there are gray areas work that's sort of

627
00:34:48,061 --> 00:34:49,440
close to your work.
But I mean,

628
00:34:49,441 --> 00:34:50,274
where,
where do you draw the line of when it's 

629
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:56,070
okay to review someone else's work?
You had a paper or a grant,

630
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,200
uh,
and when is it not?

631
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,460
And when it's self interest,
uh,

632
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,370
creeping in and,
um,

633
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,433
you know,
I think it's very important that the 

634
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:10,080
peer review process,
uh,

635
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,200
is this the best thing we have?
Uh,

636
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,560
that it be as pure as possible.
It's never going to be perfect,

637
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,340
but I think it's worth thinking about.
And,

638
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,510
uh,
and it poses,

639
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,360
it poses dilemmas on a regular basis.
