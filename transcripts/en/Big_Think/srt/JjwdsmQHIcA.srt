1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,050
The features of the Internet that we
really want to make sure persist.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,440
And I don't count on a nurse shot to do
the job here,

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:12,441
but these features include the fact that
when we're surfing the web that we're

4
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,350
actually visiting lots of different
places.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,680
The web of 1998 and sort of through the
past 10 years or so has been one where

6
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:26,280
there's lots of baskets with eggs all
over the place.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,480
And by just clicking on a link,
you can visit that new basket and not

8
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:35,100
even feel the burdens of the journey.
It could be in a basement in Chappaqua,

9
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,840
New York,
the server you're going to,

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,200
it could be Amazon,
it could be,

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,600
uh,
is somewhere in Europe,

12
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:44,550
you name it to anywhere around the
world.

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,980
That I think has been less and less so.
And part of the research,

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,770
uh,
I'm working on is to actually document

15
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:55,230
and figure out if that hypothesis is
true.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,670
I'm actually concerned that because of
worries about things like denial of

17
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:02,430
service attacks where websites might be
brought down,

18
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,790
what we'll see our websites huddling
under the umbrella of just a handful of

19
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:13,890
Internet service hosting providers.
So it might feel like you're going from

20
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:18,450
one website to another when in fact all
you're doing is visiting one quarter of

21
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:22,380
the massive data banks at Amazon that
offers up commodity web hosting to the

22
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:25,110
world that puts all the eggs in one
basket,

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,260
which seems dangerous to me.
If Amazon goes down,

24
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,650
everything goes down,
not just your ability to one click

25
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:33,810
purchase.
I'm a mouse trap.

26
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,090
And uh,
it also means that there are regulatory

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,480
changes made possible so that if a
government of the world wants something

28
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:48,270
taken down or dealt with,
they only have one door to knock on.

29
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,410
And depending on your view of how easily
government should be able to take stuff

30
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:55,590
down,
that's either a good thing or a bad

31
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:56,010
thing.

32
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,870
So having a distributed web with eggs
across lots of baskets is one thing that

33
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:04,440
I hope will persist.
The other thing is I hope the web will

34
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:06,060
persist.
You know,

35
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:08,020
the number of times,
uh,

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,040
you might find yourself living your
digital life by running a browser and

37
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,200
typing in a link.
And then from the trap he is going from

38
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:21,180
one place to another,
uh,

39
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,950
visiting each site and clicking on links
and typing stuff that's starting to feel

40
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:30,951
possibly very 2005 more and more the way
in which we experience the world or

41
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:36,150
through apps.
So if you were told,

42
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,660
you could still use your smart phone but
you just can't load up the browser,

43
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,990
you can only use apps and those apps
might have a browser quietly running in

44
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:45,270
the background.
But the experience you'll get inside

45
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:50,070
that APP is so much more defined by the
APP maker.

46
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,560
And you know,
if you're looking at facebook and you

47
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:55,830
see the sponsored links,
you're getting importuning you to do

48
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:59,260
something.
Almost always it's bottom line,

49
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,830
please install this app.
Everybody wants you to install their app

50
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,160
and that's because that's putting you
inside the bottle of a miniature

51
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:11,161
universe that isn't necessarily
connected web like to the rest of

52
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:13,870
things.
If you see something interesting inside

53
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:17,620
an app and you want to share it,
it will be under the terms of that APP.

54
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,830
Whether you can email the link or
whether you can only tweet it or whether

55
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:24,160
you can do anything with it.
There's not a common url,

56
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:28,060
that bar at the top that you can just
copy and paste and share with a friend

57
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:29,980
and then that friend can see what you
see.

58
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,000
So as I look to the future,
really thinking about the future of the

59
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:37,990
web itself is something we we ought to
be doing.

60
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,650
I don't take for granted that there will
be a worldwide web the way that there

61
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:44,470
has been,
it might be much more stove piped and

62
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:48,250
feel a little bit more like 1985 with in
America,

63
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,480
compuserve,
prodigy,

64
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:50,410
and the source.
Okay.

65
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:53,530
You've got your apps.
Those apps in turn are there at the

66
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:55,670
sufferance of your,
uh,

67
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,400
mobile phone or your other platform
vendor and so much more staid

68
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,940
possibility.
And so much of the benefits of the

69
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:08,941
Internet have come from unusual corners
from not being so staid.

70
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,900
I'd hate to think,
oh,

71
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:13,180
those were the early days.
Things have matured.

72
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,870
Now there is a genuine worry about
security that has it no longer seems so

73
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:25,120
crazy as it probably did.
I think it did.

74
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:28,930
And say the year 2000 g maybe before you
run an APP,

75
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,500
someone out there should vet it,
should know who wrote it,

76
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,110
should have their contact information on
file.

77
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,110
The way that if you get into a taxi cab,
remember taxi cabs,

78
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,220
there'd be a an identity marker.
If you use an uber or Lyft,

79
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,040
they have some way of knowing who the
drivers are.

80
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,980
They're registered.
If that's the level of security you want

81
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,600
when you drive three blocks,
why wouldn't you want that for code to

82
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:56,230
which you are and trusting your most
intimate details and more and more.

83
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:59,800
I think that's what we see happening.
I don't know that that's terrible,

84
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:04,801
but it does show a general trend in the
name of security in having

85
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:11,101
intermediaries be able to more tightly
control the code that we can run,

86
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,490
whether it's on our device or afar,
and the content that we can see.
