1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,030
The 21st century is being shaped

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,900
by heavily by technology.
In fact,

3
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:16,230
technology has always has always been
very powerful,

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,260
powerful forces in history because it
sets the context and information and

5
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:25,900
communications.
Technology definitely shape our year or

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,240
they connect people,
they make ideas and information more

7
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:33,180
transparent and open.
They can topple regimes.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,600
I fully believe that communism ended in
eastern Europe because people became

9
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:44,610
aware that they had choices and we're no
longer ready to settle for the local

10
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,130
option and therefore support those
regimes.

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,780
So technology can have very,
very powerful social impact,

12
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:55,080
political impact,
and set the context for everything we

13
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:55,914
do.

14
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,620
I don't know

15
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,000
whether people,
humanity has an overarching purpose or

16
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:10,001
direction,
but I do know that we connect with one

17
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:15,281
another and that are legacies lie in
what people remember us for later.

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,480
I think we feel alive because we're
alive in the minds of other people and

19
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:28,151
therefore that might drive us not toward
the selfish side or the reptilian parts

20
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:34,430
of our brain fight or flight and
defensive reactions.

21
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:39,431
But I think that idea that our identity
comes from being known to being cared

22
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:46,241
about by other people.
Should drive us to attempt to make more

23
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:49,880
people aware that we have something
great to give to them.

24
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:55,390
So part of my personal philosophy I get,
so part of my personal philosophy also,

25
00:01:56,961 --> 00:02:00,620
I guess,
is that giving helps you receive.

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,500
And that's what I believe our purpose
is.

27
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:07,340
I don't know about where that stands
theologically,

28
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,880
but I believe that we are in charge of
our lives on earth and,

29
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,760
and also that we have to play the hands
we're dealt.

30
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,860
I can't turn myself into some totally
different kind of person,

31
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:27,070
so I have to use what I have and if it
can resonate with other people,

32
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,790
then my identity is strengthened and
enhanced and they will remember me

33
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,640
afterwards wherever I go.
Then.
