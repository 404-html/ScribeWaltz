1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:02,580
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,070
California should do to fix its economy.
I think first you've got to recognize

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,930
California has enormous potential.
It has a,

4
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:22,931
it's a great environment.
It's very open to new ideas.

5
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:27,270
Silicon Valley,
it's got great universities,

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,260
great.
Um,

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,360
uh,
both the University of California in the

8
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:33,450
private universities.
So the potential is tremendous.

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,310
What we really need to do in California
is to deal with a serious budget

10
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:39,570
problem,
which means spending,

11
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:44,571
grows too much and then taxes rise and
that tends to drive out businesses and

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,360
ultimately as harmful to the state.
So I would say number one in terms of

13
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:52,680
the question is,
is put some limit on the growth of

14
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:56,550
spending population growth.
Plus inflation is one way to do it,

15
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,210
uh,
that would prevent the ups and downs in

16
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:03,780
the,
in the deficit spending usually rises

17
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:08,510
rapidly when tax revenues arrive and
then tax revenues fall off and you've

18
00:01:08,511 --> 00:01:09,700
got this huge deficit.

19
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,910
So control the growth of spending number
one.

20
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,740
Number two,
it put in some,

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,310
uh,
tax reforms to prevent the ups and downs

22
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:22,140
and revenues to be so great.
And here we've got a huge cyclical,

23
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,340
a performance in tax revenues.
So I would adopt some of the proposals

24
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:30,400
of the recent California Tax Commission
that a governor Schwarzenegger,

25
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,450
I introduced,
and Third Education,

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,500
k 12 it slipping in California.
I think it's not a matter of spending a

27
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:42,510
lot of spent in California.
It's really demanding more

28
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:45,900
accountability.
I'd like to see a program where there's

29
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,220
more for teachers and less for
administration on.

30
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,920
I think that would do a lot of them.
