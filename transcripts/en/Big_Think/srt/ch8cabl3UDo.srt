1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,080
I think that the people who have been
doing political satire or the people

2
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:21,230
I've talked to have really felt like it
used to be the,

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,150
again,
the media was the watchdog for um,

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,470
those,
you know,

5
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:30,700
the government and corporate America and
when the media sort of felt like it was

6
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:34,330
in bed and they were lazy or in bed
with,

7
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,380
with their,
you know,

8
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:37,030
advertisers.
Um,

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,180
I think comics naturally started filling
the role of sort of being the watchdog

10
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:44,580
of the watchdog,
you know,

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,780
pill,
political satire and comedy.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,350
We just started asking the questions
that journalists weren't asking anymore,

13
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,760
uh,
through humor,

14
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:54,560
through sort of hopefully funny,
righteous sanger,

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,760
um,
but also just asking questions that our

16
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,790
audience wanted to hear.
And so we were doing basically a service

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,290
we just kept doing,
we were doing,

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,320
but then it just transitioned into like,
find out what's going on or if we're

19
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:15,490
just going to be lied to from right left
and center to provide a haven where at

20
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:19,450
least people can come together and not
feel crazy.

21
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,111
I feel like,
Hey,

22
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:24,130
I'm in a group of people who have
understand that everybody's spinning us

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,250
and somebody onstage pointing that out
through humor.

24
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,610
At least I can breathe a sigh that I'm
not insane.

25
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:35,611
When I hear the cacophony of lies,
I think comedy can be a tool for social

26
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:42,260
activism.
I think that when you point out

27
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:45,770
hypocrisy again,
because the media often doesn't,

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,281
you know,
the,

29
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:48,380
the,
the followup question should just be put

30
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:52,550
in the Smithsonian as a relic of media
because there are no follow ups anymore.

31
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,530
People don't have enough historical
knowledge to say,

32
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,420
wait,
you're lying if you don't have enough

33
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,690
knowledge on the environment to say,
uh,

34
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,330
wait.
Scientists say there's global warming,

35
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:05,930
it's real.
So a lot of information just sort of

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,200
floats out there like,
like a thick muggy day and nobody weeds

37
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,600
through it and cuts through the muck and
says,

38
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,500
here's the truth.

39
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,500
And I think that pointing that out
through humor can be a tool to have

40
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,950
people say,
wow,

41
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,280
um,
I should be asking questions and I'm

42
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:26,350
laughing.
Uh,

43
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,800
and I think that's what's fun,
is that you can ask questions yourself

44
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:33,710
on stage through humor,
and then that means the audience kind of

45
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:36,230
scratches a tent and says,
you're right.

46
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,680
And as you watch,
uh,

47
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,210
videos on the web and the daily show,
Colbert,

48
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,210
Bill Maher,
you will see them lay out a case and

49
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:47,120
make it funny through video,
through things that are out there.

50
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,150
Somebody says one thing one day and
something else the next day.

51
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,500
And,
um,

52
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,600
you know,
we have this amazing medium with which

53
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:54,820
we can put it out,
right?

54
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,300
[inaudible].
