1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,040
Yeah,

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,440
the problem with the ICJ is effective at
certain things,

3
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:13,080
what it tends to do,
kind of the bread and butter would be at

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,610
a territorial dispute about where the
border is and our river between two

5
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:20,910
countries and when you kind of need in
that situation is just a neutral

6
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:23,400
arbiter.
You need someone to come in and for

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,640
domestic political reasons,
maybe you don't want to give up this

8
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:30,690
little island that somebody else's
claiming and the ICJ is very good at

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,900
sort of just drawing a line and making a
decision that seems neutral and

10
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:40,270
acceptable to both sides.
The problem with the ICJ is when it

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,290
wades into more controversial issues.
So recently it had a decision about the

12
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:47,990
wall and in Israel,
um,

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,550
it had a decision about nuclear weapons
a few years ago,

14
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,830
uh,
and it tends to have a hard time with

15
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:54,360
those decisions.
Uh,

16
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:56,650
and so for that reason it's not,
um,

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,310
it's not as effective as it lacks some
of the enforcement powers we might want.

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,360
You might compare the World Trade
Organization's Court,

19
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,190
the Appellate Body,
so that court is considered to be more

20
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:16,110
effective in part because it has at its
disposal enforcement measures,

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,180
uh,
and it's got a pretty good compliance

22
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:20,070
record.
So when it hands down a ruling and it

23
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:23,010
says to even the United States,
you're violating the law.

24
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,920
Usually those countries comply.
So,

25
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:28,890
um,
so not all international courts are the

26
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:30,090
same.
Um,

27
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,370
and I'd say the ICJ is,
uh,

28
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,070
is good at certain things,
not everything

29
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:45,750
question because the US does have a
unique role in a world and we are far

30
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:52,231
and away the most powerful military
power and we are very much viewed as a

31
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,640
country that's going to win when there's
something happening in genocide or

32
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:00,920
folding.
Um,

33
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,850
we have the capacity to act.
We don't always actually have the

34
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:07,570
capacity to act and people do look to us
to play that role.

35
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,950
So we do have some unique concerns that
other countries don't necessarily have.

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,400
That said the ICC is widely accepted
around the world and I think it would go

37
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,770
a long way.
I think many of the concerns against the

38
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:22,510
ICC,
the idea that there's going to be a

39
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:27,040
rogue prosecutor who will go after
American service or that we needed,

40
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,540
you know,
Congress passed this law,

41
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,320
The Hague invasion act.
So if any American ends up in the break

42
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,930
of the ICC,
we're authorized to go in and,

43
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,150
you know,
invade the Netherlands and get them out.

44
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,540
I think those kinds of fantasies are,
are really unfounded.

45
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,190
And so far the ICC has been very
cautious and I think it's again,

46
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:46,570
a,
a,

47
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,450
uh,
mostly symbolic issue for us to join

48
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:50,490
because,
uh,

49
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,760
I don't see a,
the [inaudible] principle is that if a

50
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:58,390
country tries in good faith,
its own soldiers,

51
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,800
the won't step in and we have a well
functioning military justice system.

52
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,920
So,
so I don't imagine the ICC,

53
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,970
a ruling over Americans,
but I think symbolically it'd be hugely

54
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:14,971
important and particularly after the
Bush administration's last seven plus

55
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:20,371
years of being seen as rejectionist of
every international initiative,

56
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,050
uh,
pulling out of the ABM treaty.

57
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,470
I'm on signing the international
criminal courtroom statute.

58
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,570
I'm denigrating the Kyoto Protocol.
We've lost so much goodwill.

59
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,790
And remember,
after World War II,

60
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,250
we were really the architects of this
international system.

61
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,950
We've lost so much of that that I think
these symbolic,

62
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,800
uh,
steps like signing the Rome statute

63
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,830
would go a long way towards restoring
our,

64
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:45,941
our,
I think,

65
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:48,600
our traditional image in the world,
which is a touch

66
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,230
at this point.
