1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,190
The robots have the cartoons and movies
from the 19 seventies are going to be

2
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:14,300
the reality of the 20 slash 20 and there
are two real drivers behind this.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,360
First is mapping belief space.
Historically it's been really difficult

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,050
to be able to instruct robots to do
things like grasping,

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,130
grasping might seem like a pretty
straightforward thing to do,

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,050
but it's actually very complex
mathematically and algorithmically to be

7
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:37,610
able to instruct robots how to do that.
And so what this mathematical

8
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:42,590
breakthrough in mapping belief space has
done is it as taken what are

9
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:47,591
historically very complex tasks for
robots and made them easier to do.

10
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,350
The second thing is cloud robotics.
So if c three Po right now,

11
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,980
if he walked over here and interrupted
this big think interview,

12
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,240
he would say,
oh my,

13
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:00,500
excuse me,
you know,

14
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:02,330
and,
and get out of the frame.

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,290
And as he did this,
there would be a lot of hardware and

16
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,440
software worrying in that gold claiming
body of his.

17
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,950
In reality the c three Po of the 20
slash 20 will be a cloud connected

18
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:18,080
device.
And so what he would do if he stumbled

19
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:23,000
into this interview is he is he would
ping the cloud and he would get

20
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:28,001
instructions from the hive mind that is
their algorithmically and he would then

21
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:31,790
know to excuse himself to do so in
English and two though,

22
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,730
then go clunk away.
So what does this mean?

23
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,790
What this means is that the robots of
our youths and of our imaginations don't

24
00:01:41,931 --> 00:01:46,430
have to have millions of dollars of
incredibly sophisticated hardware and

25
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:49,730
software in them.
They can be relatively lightweight dumb

26
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:54,230
devices so long as they're connected to
the power of the cloud.

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,030
So what's the significance?
Okay.

28
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,140
So they're cheaper.
So what the big significance here really

29
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:03,110
goes to labor.
So let's think about the difference

30
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:05,630
between humans and robots and their
costs.

31
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,070
Humans don't have a lot of cap ex,
but they have a lot of opex.

32
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,710
So the upfront costs costs,
you know,

33
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:14,960
maybe your employer buys you some
business cards,

34
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:17,600
maybe gets you a computer for work or
something like that.

35
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,840
Not a lot of cap ex,
not a lot of upfront costs,

36
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,890
but a lot of opex every two weeks.
You want to get paid,

37
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:26,450
right?
Lot of salary,

38
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,460
lot of op ex robots come with
diametrically opposed cost structure.

39
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,790
It's a lot of cap ex.
You've got to buy the robot,

40
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,010
but then relatively little objects,
you can work them 24 hours a day.

41
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,660
They aren't going to join a union or get
sick and they don't expect to salary and

42
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:49,661
so what's happening right now is we're
seeing new equilibrium points in terms

43
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,570
of the tradeoff between the relative
cost of a cap backs,

44
00:02:55,611 --> 00:03:00,611
intense opex,
slight robot and a cap ex light opics in

45
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,210
high labor of humans.

46
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,650
I saw this in all places in East Asia,
in the football field,

47
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:13,630
size factories of Fox con,
the Taiwanese company that makes all of

48
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:18,631
our smartphones and Terry Gou,
the CEO of Foxconn who employs 973,000

49
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:24,020
people,
has decided he's not hiring anymore

50
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,980
humans.
He's just buying robots.

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,730
And so I think that this is.
This is fascinating stuff.

52
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,150
As the robots have,
the cartoons and movies become the

53
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:37,810
reality of the 20 twenties.
They aren't going to look like the

54
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:42,580
metallic out the metallic robots have of
the cartoons and movies that are

55
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:47,200
actually going to look more human
because of advances in material sciences

56
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,470
from electroactive polymers to to silk
skin to air muscles and other such

57
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,380
things,
so the robots are the future may

58
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:02,830
actually look more like terminator than
like Star Wars.

59
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,710
What's also interesting that's happening
right now is,

60
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,190
particularly in Japan and South Korea,
there are robots being developed.

61
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,450
The purpose of which is actually to do
what we normally think of as the most

62
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:21,510
intimate human tasks to do things like
take care of our aging grandparents and

63
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:27,430
part of this is flowing from an economic
imperative and Japan,

64
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:31,210
for example,
Japan has the world's oldest population

65
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,220
and it's only growing older and so
companies like Toyota and Honda.

66
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,160
Yup.
The ones that make the cars are now

67
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:44,161
making elder care robots because there
aren't enough young Japanese to take

68
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:49,480
care of the grandparents and so things
that we think of as very intimate and

69
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:52,930
very human in the future will be
increasingly robotic.

70
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,020
It's not a surprise that this is coming
out of Asia.

71
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,840
Interestingly,
in societies like Japan,

72
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,630
where Shinto is the Nash is the national
religion.

73
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,420
In Shinto,
for example,

74
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:08,770
they have a belief in animism that
objects can have souls,

75
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,210
and so that's a big difference than
Judeo Christian religions,

76
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,240
which think of objects as being a
soulless and if you contrast the culture

77
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,350
and mythology of a lot of Asian
societies,

78
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,380
it's much more embracing of automation
and robotics as opposed to western

79
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:34,621
societies were from icarus with his wax
wings to Frankenstein and beyond.

80
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,420
Most of our culture,
most of our mythology is rooted in the

81
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:44,830
risks of giving life to those things
that perhaps we ought not to.

82
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,420
So I don't think it's a big surprise
that a lot of these innovations are

83
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:51,070
coming from East Asia.
