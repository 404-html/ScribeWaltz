1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,190
I hope it,
I hope it comes out,

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,160
um,
intensely.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,580
Um,
that's not to say that it's about me,

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,470
that I,
I think that,

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,130
you know,
conducting is obviously a visual

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,120
activity because it's about showing
things with your gesture to the

7
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,760
musicians.
But I don't want the audience to feel

8
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:26,280
that they have to see a show from me in
order to,

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,090
to feel how exciting that the music is.
Um,

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,900
but on the other hand,
if the music is exciting and if I look

11
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:38,901
unengaged and not not in it,
then that would certainly prevent the

12
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:40,770
experience from being what it really
should be.

13
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:45,771
So it's a fine line that you have to
sort of walk to,

14
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,490
to really infuse the performance and the
music with your deeply committed

15
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:57,300
personality while allowing the music to
still be paramount.

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,850
It's a,
it's a tricky thing and that's,

17
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,010
uh,
that's what we're all all going for.

18
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,140
Absolutely.
I mean,

19
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:06,771
I,
you know,

20
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:10,760
you have to allow your face to show the
show the character of the music.

21
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:13,730
But that's not something that I plan,
you know,

22
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:15,050
it's like you don't say,
okay,

23
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:17,480
well I want them to think I'm happy so
I'll smile now.

24
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,840
Um,
you're naturally allow yourself to feel

25
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:22,340
the music and then just as you,
you know,

26
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:24,020
when you're hanging out,
you know,

27
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:26,450
sometimes your face looks more serious.
Sometimes it looks more animated,

28
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:28,160
sometimes it looks more pensive.
You,

29
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,720
no,
that's definitely part of the

30
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:34,721
communication.
It happens right away actually are.

31
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:36,700
Hopefully it does.
If it doesn't,

32
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:39,350
then there's probably something wrong.
Um,

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,930
it's interesting.
You can,

34
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,810
you can,
you can really understand the difference

35
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:46,090
in orchestra,
um,

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,690
feels and conductors,
if you go to a conducting class where

37
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,720
there may be six or 10 or 12 conductors
in a very short span of time,

38
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,960
often it happens that these conductors
will be doing the same music.

39
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:01,000
So you have a really good basis of
comparison.

40
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,300
The sound is literally different within
one second of instantly,

41
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,600
once a new conductor comes on,
they'll conduct the same music that had

42
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:13,690
just been done by another conductor.
The orchestra sounds completely

43
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:14,800
different.
It's uncanny.

44
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,670
There's something in the body language
that immediately translates into sound.

45
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,504
And,
uh,

46
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,070
that's one of the exciting and kind of,
uh,

47
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,430
amazing things about conducting.
