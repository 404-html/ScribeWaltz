1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,373
MMM,

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,550
we all want to have a good stable 
relationship with somebody at one of the

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,384
problems with early stage intense 
feelings of romantic love is that it's 

4
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:18,180
part of the oldest parts of the brain 
that become activated brain regions link

5
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:19,750
with drive,
with craving,

6
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:21,640
with obsession,
with motivation,

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,803
and in fact,
some cognitive regions up in the 

8
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:26,314
prefrontal cortex that have evolved much
more reasonably begin to shut down a 

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,670
brain region linked with this decision 
making,

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,570
uh,
planning ahead,

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,920
um,
you know,

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,840
uh,
people were madly in love,

13
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:38,683
can fall madly in love with somebody 
who's married who lives on the other 

14
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:43,390
side of the planet,
who comes from a different religion.

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,030
And somehow they'll say to themselves,
we'll work it out.

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,920
We can work this out because of all that
energy of intense romantic love and also

17
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:55,300
the shutting down of various brain 
systems like with decision making.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,550
So one of the things that I say to 
people is,

19
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,361
you know,
uh,

20
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:00,980
before you decide to marry somebody,
um,

21
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,200
um,
spend some,

22
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,110
a good deal of time with them.
Uh,

23
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:06,963
so there's some of that early stage 
intense feelings of romantic love can 

24
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:09,904
begin to subside and you can begin to 
really see what you've got is a matter 

25
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:15,334
of fact.
I'm very optimistic about the future of 

26
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:18,004
relationships because we're spending so 
much time now getting to know somebody 

27
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,590
before we were,
you know,

28
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,483
a great many people are having these one
night stands and friends with benefits 

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,910
and a living together before they 
married.

30
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,103
And there was a recent study which they 
asked a lot of single people who were 

31
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:38,800
living together with somebody,
um,

32
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,500
uh,
why have they not yet married?

33
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,860
And 67 percent were terrified of 
divorce,

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,850
terrified of the,
not only the legal and the financial and

35
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:49,684
the economic,
but the personal and social fallout of 

36
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:52,594
divorce.

37
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,523
And so began to,
I began to realize maybe all this 

38
00:01:56,861 --> 00:02:01,300
hooking up and friends with benefits and
living together is not recklessness.

39
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,313
Maybe it's caution.
Maybe singles are trying to learn every 

40
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:11,011
single thing they can about a potential 
partner before they tie the knot.

41
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,693
And in short,
marriage used to be the beginning of a 

42
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:15,814
relationship.
Now it's the finale and I think that 

43
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:20,620
that is very positive as a matter of 
fact.

44
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:22,180
Um,
I work with match.com

45
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:23,570
and their senior,
other,

46
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,140
other chief scientific advisor.
And um,

47
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,160
we did a study of married people not on 
the site match.com,

48
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:32,290
of course,
of 1100 married people.

49
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,550
And I had reason.
Well,

50
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:38,551
if there's this long precommitment stage
of getting to know somebody,

51
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,170
maybe by the time you walk down the 
aisle,

52
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,213
you know what you've got,
you're happy with what you got and 

53
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:45,490
you're going to build a long,
stable,

54
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:47,110
really happy marriage.

55
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,123
Maybe we're going towards a time of 
happier marriages because relationships 

56
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:55,780
can end before you tie the knot.
So with,

57
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,870
in this study,
I asked these 1100 married people,

58
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,770
um,
uh,

59
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,890
a lot of questions,
but one of the questions was,

60
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,910
would you remarry the person you're 
currently married to?

61
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,133
An 81 percent said yes.
And I think that with what I call fast 

62
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,050
sex,
slow love,

63
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,360
with this slow process of getting to 
know somebody very carefully over a long

64
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:20,194
period of time,
it's going to help the brain readjust 

65
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,970
some of these brain regions for decision
making.

66
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,170
You're going to get to know how this 
person handles your parents at Christmas

67
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:31,720
or whatever holiday,
you know,

68
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:34,630
how they handle your friends,
how they handle their money,

69
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,610
how they handle an argument,
uh,

70
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,180
how they handle getting exercise and 
their own health and your health,

71
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:42,400
et cetera.
You learn a lot about the person.

72
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,473
I think we're in a fair,
I'm very optimistic about the future 

73
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,770
because of this concept of slow love.
I'm not really in the advice business,

74
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,623
uh,
or the business I think people should 

75
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,620
marry when they feel like marrying.
But from what I know about the brain,

76
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,920
um,
if it were me,

77
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,503
I'd wait at least two years because in 
two years you see the full cycle of the 

78
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,270
year twice.
You see how they handle halloween,

79
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,360
how they handled Christmas or Hanukkah,
how they handle a summer fun.

80
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,760
Uh,
and to see,

81
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,060
see that twice is I think important.
And by the way,

82
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,700
you can sustain that intense feelings of
romantic love.

83
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:29,290
For two years I've studied 5,000
people through match.com,

84
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,030
not on the match.com
site,

85
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,193
a representative sample of Americans 
based on the US census and a great many 

86
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:37,594
of them say that they've had the 
experience of sustained feelings of 

87
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:43,510
intense romantic love for somebody for 
two to five years.

88
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,840
So if you pick the right person and you 
know how to sustain some of the joy,

89
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,820
uh,
I think you can create a longterm,

90
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,033
um,
attachment that is full also have 

91
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,194
periods of romantic love.
We all want to sustain a longterm happy 

92
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:04,921
partnership and psychologists will give 
you a long list of smart ways to sustain

93
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,264
it.
But I'd like to say what the brain can 

94
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:10,414
add.
I studied the brain and the first thing 

95
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,034
that you want to do is sustain the three
basic brain systems for mating and 

96
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:21,490
reproduction.
Sex drive.

97
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,910
Have sex with the partner,
have sex regularly with the partner.

98
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:25,744
If you don't have time scheduled a time 
to have sex with the partner because 

99
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:30,400
when you have sex with a partner,
a,

100
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:31,234
you're driving up the testosterone 
systems so you're going to want to have 

101
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:35,590
more sex,
but you also have all the cuddling which

102
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:36,424
is going to drive up the oxytocin system
and give you feelings of attachment and 

103
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,510
having sex with the person,
uh,

104
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,353
any kind of stimulation of the genitals 
drives up the dopamine system and can 

105
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:47,710
sustain feelings of romantic love.

106
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,960
So basically having set and of course 
there's,

107
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:55,230
there can be good jokes about it and a 
relaxation about it that is good for the

108
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,064
body and the mind.
So have sex with a person and sustain 

109
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:00,104
that brain system of this x drive to 
sustain feelings of intense romantic 

110
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:05,330
love.
Do novel things together.

111
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,343
Novelty drives up the dope immune system
and can sustain feelings of romantic 

112
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:11,330
love.
And this isn't just in the bedroom.

113
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,700
Just go to a different restaurant on 
Friday night.

114
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:17,450
Take your bicycle instead of a car,
a read to each other in bed.

115
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,670
Sit together on the couch and,
and,

116
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,980
and have a discussion about something 
new.

117
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,990
Read new books together,
novelty,

118
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:25,010
novelty,
novelty,

119
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,440
sustained feelings of intense romantic 
love.

120
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,890
You also want to sustain feelings of 
deep attachment.

121
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,800
And to do that,
you have to just stay in touch.

122
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,500
Uh,
learn to sleep in the person's arm.

123
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,510
At least start that way.
Um,

124
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,870
cuddle a after dinner,
a walk arm in,

125
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:44,840
arm down the street,
hold hands together,

126
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,330
put your foot on top of his foot or her 
foot while you're having dinner,

127
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,193
gently of course,
but stay in touch that drives up the 

128
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:53,114
oxytocin system and can give you 
feelings of deep attachment to the 

129
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:57,584
partner.
So you want to sustain all three of 

130
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:00,290
those brain systems,
sex drive,

131
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,540
feelings of romantic love and feelings 
of deep attachment.

132
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,630
But we've also found out,
um,

133
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,040
what's going on in the brain in longterm
happy partners.

134
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,083
We did a study,
a brain scan study of people who were 

135
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,610
married,
an average of 21 years.

136
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,680
And those people who were married an 
average of 21 years who were still madly

137
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:26,300
in love with their partner showed 
activity in three brain regions of brain

138
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:27,134
region linked with empathy,
a brain region linked with controlling 

139
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,034
your own emotions and a brain region 
linked with what we call positive 

140
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,073
illusions.

141
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,200
The simple ability,
but sometimes it's hard to overlook what

142
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:44,540
you don't like about somebody and then 
focus on what you do.

143
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,420
So last but not least,
um,

144
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,030
we've known known that,
um,

145
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,250
if you say several nice things to your 
partner every day,

146
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,950
um,
I would suggest five.

147
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:56,690
But if you can only pull off two or 
three,

148
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,553
whatever,
say Nice things to your partner that 

149
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:05,021
actually reduces their cholesterol,
reduces their cortisol,

150
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:08,480
which is the stress hormone and boosts 
their immune system.

151
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,463
But it also boosts yours.
So what the brain says about a happy 

152
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:16,520
longterm partnership is overlook what 
your Dole.

153
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:18,710
I can focus on what you do,
be,

154
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,610
express empathy for the partner,
control your own emotions,

155
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,810
have sex with the partner,
do novel things together,

156
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:30,240
and stay in touch and say several nice 
things every day.

157
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,273
And you will,
your brain will help you sustain a 

158
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,200
longterm,
deep attachment.

159
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,360
We're built to.
We're built to love.
