1
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,290
Depression is often misunderstood in the
public.

2
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:15,730
Sometimes people think that people with
depression are weak or lazy when in

3
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:17,130
actuality,
um,

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,130
people with depression are struggling
with a very complex illness that has

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,960
biological,
psychological,

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,020
and social causes and consequences.
Depression is extremely common.

7
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,100
It affects one in four women and about
one in five or six men,

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,250
and those who don't experience
depression themselves often have a

9
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:39,440
friend or family member who are
experiencing it.

10
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,220
The most commonly experienced symptoms
of depression are sad.

11
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:48,221
Mood and lack of pleasure,
people often no sleep changes in energy

12
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:50,330
changes.
And almost everybody I've ever

13
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:52,460
interviewed,
which would be over 2000 people with

14
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:54,470
depression,
I'll experienced feelings of

15
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,920
worthlessness.
Almost every single one.

16
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,500
Depression is an invisible illness.
It's not one that you can see just by

17
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:08,090
looking at somebody's normal.
Sadness can occur in response to life

18
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:09,290
events.
Depression,

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,610
at least in its later stages,
tends to be disconnected from actual

20
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:18,530
life events.
So depression and sadness share the

21
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:21,110
sadness,
but depression is so much more than just

22
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:22,280
sadness.
And as a matter of fact,

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,780
some people think the worst part of
depression is now experiencing pleasure.

24
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,590
There's a numbness and how sometimes
when people have severe depression field

25
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,660
pull yourself up by the bootstraps,
you should get yourself out of this or

26
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:40,140
things like your life is great.
What do you have to be depressed about?

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Depression is definitely not related to
someone's character or moral

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,890
shortcomings and it's really interesting
the thing that if medication can help

29
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:54,060
people who have these illnesses,
how could it really be about their

30
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:58,840
morality?
Depression can affect every aspect of a

31
00:01:58,841 --> 00:02:02,590
person's life.
It can affect their job performance,

32
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,570
their family relationships,
their divorce rates are higher.

33
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,840
I can affect their parenting abilities
and depression is one of the leading

34
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:16,510
causes of economic burden of any
diseases.

35
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,660
People are often surprised to hear that
it costs more to the society then cancer

36
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:22,840
or heart disease.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,180
If depression goes untreated,
it could turn out a variety of different

38
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,850
ways.
It could be that people stay at the same

39
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:31,980
sort of,
um,

40
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,090
negative level that they've been.
Or sometimes it can get much worse so it

41
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,130
can,
with each passing depression,

42
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:44,131
some people feel worse and worse so that
they might have approximately about 20

43
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:49,180
percent of people I believe with major
depression ended up making some form of

44
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:51,580
suicide attempt.
So the question is,

45
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:54,610
how do we get people to feel better so
that they can think better or vice

46
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:57,100
versa,
how do we get them to think differently

47
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,840
so that they can feel differently?

48
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,020
Usually people come at depression with
one form of treatment or the other.

49
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,450
They'll either go and get medication or
the goal get psychotherapy where they'll

50
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,070
do nothing.
In fact,

51
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:15,940
the data support that the best treatment
for depression is a combination of

52
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:20,260
medication and psychotherapy.
I think there's a lots of strategies

53
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:22,450
that people can use in order to try to
feel better,

54
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,300
um,
improving their sleep and sleep hygiene,

55
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,820
exercising 30 minutes a day.
Um,

56
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,340
it's particularly aerobic exercise seems
to be very effective for people at

57
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:35,800
depression.
And for the social piece,

58
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:40,801
I'd really recommend to try to develop
more social engagement with people

59
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:42,970
because again,
I think that's one way that people can

60
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:44,530
actually help themselves.
To feel better.

61
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,800
The good news is that depression is a
very treatable illness.

62
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,850
The majority of people who get care,
particularly if they can get care early,

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,470
we'll end up doing very well.
