1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,143
Hmm.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,340
Ooh.
Oh.

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,640
How does one define simplicity?
Very good question.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,310
Uh,
to me it is just,

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,390
uh,
a distilled thought,

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,650
uh,
something that registers quickly.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,133
Um,
it doesn't require a lot of 

8
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:33,770
explanations,
seems intuitively obvious,

9
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:35,510
that kind of a thing.
And I think,

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,593
uh,
a lot of businesses out there tend to 

11
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:43,540
put things in terms,
uh,

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,580
that require more,
more fought study or whatever.

13
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:49,694
And I think what made steve jobs is such
a genius was that he had this belief in 

14
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:54,704
the power of simplicity and he wanted to
ensure that his products embodied that 

15
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,480
and the way the company communicated 
with people embodied that.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,913
So I think simplicity is this thing.
It's a concept really that gets applied 

17
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:15,230
to so many different things.
It's not just,

18
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,450
Oh,
look at the simple product.

19
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:18,284
It's,
it's the whole structure of the 

20
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:21,854
organization as the belief system.
All that stuff is based on this idea 

21
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:29,510
that,
that human beings have,

22
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,170
uh,
a built in desire for simpler things.

23
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,860
We just don't like to Labor over complex
issues.

24
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:41,000
And when someone has something to,
to share with us,

25
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,160
whether it's a product or service or 
whatever,

26
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:47,900
that the people who,
who really understand that simplicity is

27
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:51,510
a very powerful thing.
Those are the people who,

28
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:54,830
who establish an emotional connection 
with their customers,

29
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,700
which is something that apple was very,
very good at doing.

30
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,140
I do think that simplicity is one of the
hardest things you can do.

31
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,280
And it is deceptive in that way because 
it looks simple.

32
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,893
Um,
the way I like to put it is that there 

33
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:16,154
is no such thing as simplicity.
There is only the perception of 

34
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:21,680
simplicity that every simple thing we 
see in this world,

35
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:22,514
whether it's an iphone,
obviously years worth of research goes 

36
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:28,220
into making the little things that make 
an iphone.

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,000
But you could look at a simple website 
and,

38
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,043
uh,
we all know we who create such things 

39
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:38,180
know that this beautifully simple site 
that you've,

40
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,640
you've built could have been the result 
of,

41
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,270
of weeks or months of,
of anguish,

42
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:49,450
debate and differences of opinion and 
arguments and whatever.

43
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,200
And you end up with something that's 
simple.

44
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,830
So what's really important is the 
perception of simplicity.

45
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,940
Uh,
did have,

46
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,250
if someone walks away from the 
experience and that it was simple,

47
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,050
that's,
you know,

48
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,680
mission accomplished.
But I think getting there is really,

49
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:10,681
really hard.
It requires all that commitment and uh,

50
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,040
energy.
It,

51
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,570
it,
it doesn't come easily.

52
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,060
I guess that's the point.
But when you do get there,

53
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:20,940
it becomes very,
very worth it.

54
00:03:20,941 --> 00:03:22,690
In fact,
there's a great steve jobs quote,

55
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:24,340
it's always about Steve Jobs,
isn't it,

56
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,950
where he said that,
um,

57
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,340
it takes a lot of hard work to make 
something simple,

58
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:33,070
but it's worth it in the end because 
once you get there,

59
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,053
you can move mountains.
And I think those are great words to 

60
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:40,340
live by.
But he understood that that was the,

61
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,263
the,
the challenge for apple was to take 

62
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,410
really cool products and really cool 
capabilities and put them in a,

63
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,620
in a form that people could so easily 
relate to and,

64
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,740
and take advantage of without thick 
manuals and that kind of a thing.

65
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,860
So that's the real work is,
is making great things simple.

66
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,240
The big question is how do you do it?
Where does simplicity come from?

67
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:09,310
And that's a question I hear all the 
time.

68
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:11,470
And um,
you know,

69
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,280
I have some humble suggestions on that 
topic.

70
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,593
Um,
I think because simple is such a simple 

71
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:21,784
thing,
it comes along with some simple advice 

72
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,053
and I think that one of the most 
important things you can do is simply 

73
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,523
step back and look at your,
what you're doing through the eyes of 

74
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:35,830
the customer.
I believe that that was Steve Jobs,

75
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:36,843
amazing strength that he looked at this 
experience that apple was creating and 

76
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:43,030
he looked at it with a super critical 
eye.

77
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,830
What would he think as a customer?
I think that a lot of,

78
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,640
uh,
company leaders don't do that as well as

79
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:54,814
Steve.
And I think you can criticize your own 

80
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,510
products and services and your website 
and all that stuff.

81
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,793
Um,
you can excuse your own lapses by 

82
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:07,420
saying,
yeah,

83
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,254
well we did the best we could because we
had these certain issues and that's how 

84
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:13,720
we dealt with it.
But that's the difference between,

85
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,360
you know,
a regular person in a steve jobs,

86
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:18,400
kind of a person.
Steve was just,

87
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,520
I'm sorry,
no compromises allowed.

88
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,560
And if you suggest to me that we're 
going to compromise,

89
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,843
you know,
your future here is probably not very 

90
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:27,154
good.
He believed that the user experience 

91
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:32,440
with all important.
So I always tell people,

92
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,283
you know,
the best place to start for me is to 

93
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:39,310
just be the customer and look at every 
part of the customer experience from the

94
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:42,310
very first ad they might see to the 
website,

95
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:45,070
to what the retail experiences like,
you know,

96
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:48,040
how hard it is to order when you get the
product,

97
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:52,120
what does it feel like to open it up and
start experiencing it.

98
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,850
And the then of course,
the design of the product,

99
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:56,900
the interface,
uh,

100
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,280
when you need help,
what's,

101
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,133
you know,
how easy is it to get support the whole 

102
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:01,424
bit.
So you create this experience that is 

103
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:07,700
simple for people and you know,
fails to,

104
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,670
um,
to confuse them in a very,

105
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,504
very good way.
So,

106
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,823
you know,
you look at all the choices some people 

107
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,050
provide to their customers.
Uh,

108
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,030
you know,
with all the best intentions,

109
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:23,150
you might go to a website and there are 
20 different products to choose from.

110
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,013
Whereas a company that really believes 
in simplicity might say here are three 

111
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,710
and we've thought it all out of there,
three kinds of people here.

112
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:31,221
There's,
you know,

113
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:34,070
the small,
medium and large or whatever it is.

114
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,383
Um,
that make it easy for you to make a 

115
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:38,570
decision rather than,
than,

116
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,123
you know,
force you to think too hard and then 

117
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,943
wonder after you made the purchase 
whether you might've made a big mistake 

118
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,920
and that kind of a thing.

119
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,820
So I think apple again has been very 
good at,

120
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:52,850
at doing that kind of a thing.
So it's customers go away feeling pretty

121
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:56,060
confident that they got the right thing 
and they enjoy the experience.

122
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,750
But all along the way,
all these decisions that must be made,

123
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,363
uh,
need to be looked at with that kind of 

124
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,390
brutal bit of,
you know,

125
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:06,224
self analysis that is the experience so 
good that you would actually tell your 

126
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:14,600
friends about it and say,
you got to look at this thing with me.

127
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,434
I,
I love this thing and you're going to 

128
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:18,530
like it to,
or is it just kind of like,

129
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,770
okay,
and you know,

130
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,050
I'd buy it.
And then,

131
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,943
you know,
I'm not sure if I'd tell anyone about 

132
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:24,020
it,
but that's,

133
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:24,530
you know,
it,

134
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,240
it worked for me,
that kind of a thing.

135
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,583
And I think in the world of Steve Jobs,
it was always about making the 

136
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:34,760
experience like amazingly good.

137
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,683
And,
and too many people are willing to 

138
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,410
compromise that away.
Simplicity requires that kind of,

139
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,393
that,
that brutal assessment of what is 

140
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,593
really,
really good versus what's good enough 

141
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,070
and what's good enough isn't good 
enough.

142
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,600
It's gotta be really,
really good.

143
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,930
Okay.
So you're mister simplicity.

144
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,710
What about your personal life?
As simple as that?

145
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,100
And the answer is not at all really.
And I'm working on it,

146
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,520
but I think simplicity is something that
works in business and it should work and

147
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:11,870
your personal life as well.
Um,

148
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,500
and it's,
it's a gratifying way to live and work.

149
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:19,304
I think there's something very 
satisfying about having this kind of 

150
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:28,970
space in your life and the order and the
lack of clutter and the,

151
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:31,910
and the firm direction.
But you know,

152
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:36,080
life is complicated and that's,
and it's because life is complicated.

153
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,960
That's simplicity stands out.
So we got to take the good with the bad.

154
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,230
You know,
we live in this complicated world,

155
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,123
but that actually gives us an 
opportunity to be more noticed by being 

156
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:49,550
simple.
So whether it's business or personal,

157
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,940
uh,
simplest,

158
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,190
he has that kind of power.

159
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,270
Ooh.
