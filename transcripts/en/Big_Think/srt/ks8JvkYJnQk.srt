1
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:13,080
I wasn't obsessed with a rock.
I certainly didn't see the hand of Iraq

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,440
and al Qaeda or anything like that.
I felt that,

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,570
uh,
frankly we had our hands full with

4
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:20,980
Afghanistan.
We needed to do that.

5
00:00:20,981 --> 00:00:23,080
Right.
And like I say,

6
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:26,080
I think we've done it reasonably well.
We could have done it better.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,580
I felt that Saddam had to go.
I felt it was a good idea to go after

8
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:35,581
him whether we needed to do it alone.
There's a whole other matter.

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,810
Um,
yes,

10
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:38,860
we had,
you know,

11
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:41,090
this coalition,
uh,

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,990
but it wasn't the same coalition,
like the coalition on Afghanistan.

13
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:45,840
That was clear.
Uh,

14
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,100
another point was that I believed,
yeah,

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,120
that there was a problem with weapons of
mass destruction and it was meant to me

16
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:53,890
at least,
was a matter of connecting dots.

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,690
And that is,
he was a guy,

18
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:57,850
Saddam Hussein,
who detect five other countries,

19
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,620
a heat attack by rain,
Arac,

20
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,800
Iran,
Saudi Arabia,

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,170
Israel,
and Kuwait.

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,540
Okay.
So it's interesting that out of the

23
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:08,980
five,
three were other Arab countries.

24
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,560
And of course he'd attacked his own
people and Curtis,

25
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,260
Stan,
he'd used weapons of mass destruction.

26
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,490
And he was giving $25,000 to every
Palestinian family that had a suicide

27
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:22,150
bomber in the family.
So there was a connection to terrorism,

28
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:26,230
there was a proclivity to attack others
and there was a desire to develop

29
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,030
weapons of mass destruction and use
them.

30
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,420
So if you connected the dots,
you saw that this guy really was a

31
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:34,120
threat and he was behaving as if he were
a threat.

32
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,460
You know,
he didn't want to let inspectors in and

33
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:38,590
so on and so forth.
Um,

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,260
but my sense of it was we should've gone
in,

35
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,600
knocked him out,
got now we could have done that until we

36
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:50,590
disbanded the Iraqi military.
Once we disbanded the Iraqi military and

37
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,240
disbanded the bath,
he was,

38
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:53,620
no,
there was no structure.

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,970
There was no country.
We were stuck

40
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,140
[inaudible]

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,650
that.
I've never been a great believer in

42
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:03,070
nation building.
Uh,

43
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,360
I think,
you know,

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,780
everybody should be prepared to modify
their views.

45
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:10,170
And Afghanistan taught me that you can
do some nation building and as did

46
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,730
Boston here.
Um,

47
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,090
but you can't do it alone.
I still don't believe the United States

48
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,570
is best equipped to do nation building.
We have a terrible record at it.

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,660
We've done it well twice,
Germany and Japan.

50
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,240
But first we flattened them both.
Um,

51
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,790
that's not the sort of thing we're
likely to do in the future.

52
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,290
Nuke somebody or flatten somebody,
you know,

53
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,470
addressed and type thing.
And we're not good at it.

54
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,110
We're not colonialists we don't have a
colonial office.

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,740
So for gun to do it,
we have to do it in concert with others,

56
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,920
but really in concert with others,
um,

57
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,730
Afghanistan led me to believe that,
uh,

58
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,880
Iraq,
we didn't disband the bath and the Iraqi

59
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:53,520
military in concert with others.
From what I understand,

60
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:56,310
we didn't even disband them in concert
with [inaudible] own administration.

61
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,530
[inaudible].
