1
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,920
Cool experience of African Americans and
the United States.

2
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,980
Uh,
you have to start with the experience of

3
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:21,981
slavery and the vestiges of slavery in
terms of the trump,

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,890
the trauma associated with it.
And I think that,

5
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,660
um,
you know,

6
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:31,630
blacks continue to experience a trauma
in,

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,700
in,
in certain ways,

8
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:35,330
and certainly with respect to,
uh,

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,680
those who live in urban communities that
are,

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,820
uh,
sort of a infested with drugs or that

11
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:46,260
are particularly violent,
those are traumatic situations that they

12
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:51,261
experience on a daily basis.
Certainly as we've seen and in recent

13
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:55,800
events,
interactions with the police can be,

14
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,540
again,
particularly traumatic.

15
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,890
So when you talk about mental illness
and the black community,

16
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:06,891
I think you have to began with the
experience of trauma and how trauma

17
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:11,340
continues to abound and,
um,

18
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:14,100
and their experiences and their in their
daily lives.

19
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,130
I think that what happens for a lot of
individuals is that they suffer in

20
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,140
silence,
um,

21
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,010
with respect to having a mental illness.

22
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,050
And so what I mean by that,
in the greater society,

23
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,770
there are certainly a lot of stigma
associated with mental illness.

24
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,120
Um,
it's sort of antithetical to the

25
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:41,100
American ethic,
which is to,

26
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,620
you know,
be strong and courageous to pull

27
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:47,250
yourself up by the bootstrap to weather
the storm,

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,360
etc. I think the second part of that,
you know,

29
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:55,320
point is what's happening at the
community level or the society level.

30
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,250
And I think what happens is that within
the black community,

31
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,380
um,
I think that again,

32
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,610
you know,
that ethic about what it means to be

33
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:07,500
strong and courageous,
um,

34
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,580
is particularly pronounced because,
um,

35
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,770
of trying to,
you know,

36
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,680
combat those forces like discrimination
or racism.

37
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,750
Um,
and you know,

38
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:22,080
it just adds to the burden of,
you know,

39
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:25,800
sort of what it means to survive.
And so then the person who is struggling

40
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:29,410
with the mental illnesses perhaps not
embraced or you know,

41
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,010
warmly accepted because of their
struggles.

42
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,210
You know,
I remember,

43
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,590
uh,
as a,

44
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:35,281
as a,
as a,

45
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:38,880
as a young person growing up,
I used to hear about the person who was

46
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:42,750
quote unquote sitting down south.
I used to wonder what that meant.

47
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,110
And it wasn't until I got older that I
became more knowledgeable of the fact

48
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:52,140
that a purse,
that person was struggling with a mental

49
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:55,380
illness or perhaps substance abuse.
From a historical perspective,

50
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:58,980
there's been a lot of emphasis and the
black community,

51
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,540
particularly in back families,
uh,

52
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:06,280
on keeping your problems close to the
vest and the home,

53
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:09,370
you don't share what's going on with
outsiders.

54
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:14,371
No one can treat you as best as your
family can.

55
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:17,890
You bring all your burdens and your
problems to your family.

56
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,130
And if you do take it any to any entity
outside of your family,

57
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,430
it's the black church.

58
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,150
The church is really important in the
black community and make no mistake

59
00:03:32,151 --> 00:03:33,850
about it.
It's a,

60
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:35,540
a source of,
uh,

61
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,240
you know,
sort of salvation and uh,

62
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:42,410
and the healing and there's a whole
collective support,

63
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,790
uh,
from,

64
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,060
you know,
you get from your fellow church goers

65
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:50,240
and that sort of thing.
But I think also what has historically

66
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:52,520
happened is died.
Um,

67
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,150
the church has been defined as the place
to sort of relieve your symptoms or to

68
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,830
address your burdens.
And so it stops there.

69
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,680
And what I think needs to happen is
that,

70
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,370
first of all,
I think pastors and lay ministers can be

71
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:12,320
more trained,
uh,

72
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:16,310
and the signs and presentations of a
mental illness.

73
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:19,220
But I think that the church could be
sort of a triage unit,

74
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:22,880
if you will,
such that it identifies those who have

75
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:27,860
needs and it's that sort of first step
and the sort of entree into care.

76
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,090
But it shouldn't stop there.
I believe that culturally competent care

77
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:37,150
is critical to everything.
If patients perceive that providers are

78
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,650
inauthentic and do not care about their
unique circumstances,

79
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:49,010
then they're likely to be turned off at
our baseline.

80
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:54,011
Providers should understand there the
history of their neighborhoods,

81
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:58,340
for example,
or the history of the experience of,

82
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,940
uh,
of African Americans and Latinos,

83
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,630
um,
such that they can put the clinical

84
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:10,631
presentation into context and understand
what unique factors,

85
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,470
um,
are in play with respect to the clinical

86
00:05:15,471 --> 00:05:18,830
presentation and how that person is
seeking to,

87
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,490
you know,
survive and live in the world as an

88
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:27,491
African American or Latino.
And so I think that it's the onus is on

89
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:32,861
the provider to understand that context
and to understand what it means,

90
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,670
uh,
for that person to live in that context.
