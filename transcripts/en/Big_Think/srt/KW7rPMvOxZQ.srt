1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,760
Several years ago,
the World Health Organization declared

2
00:00:06,761 --> 00:00:11,620
that it wasn't cost effective to help
people get treatment for drug resistant

3
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:14,950
tuberculosis,
and there was an organization called

4
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:19,090
partners in health that said simply
refused six up this claim.

5
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:21,760
They said,
we're going to do whatever it takes to

6
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:25,180
help these people.
So they came up with a program for

7
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:30,181
treating drug resistant tuberculosis in
some of the world's most conflict ridden

8
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:33,430
poorest places,
and they succeeded in doing it.

9
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:36,610
They had very good treatment outcomes,
so they thought creatively about how to

10
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:38,950
come up with treatment programs that
worked,

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,520
and as a result,
funding for drug resistant TB increased

12
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:45,820
spectacularly.
And now many people around the world

13
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,430
have treatment.
So what do they do?

14
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:52,930
I think what they did is they have this
virtue which requires three things.

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,430
First that we commit to fulfilling human
rights.

16
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,640
Second,
that we think creatively or imagine ways

17
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:03,610
of doing that,
and finally that we act to do so.

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,990
So let me explain the virtue of creative
resolve a little bit more and hopefully

19
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,960
you'll see why I think it's really
important.

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,780
So first,
to have the virtue,

21
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,460
one has to question evidence against the
possibility of fulfilling human rights.

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,410
We can do this in many ways so we can
question the source reliability or

23
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:27,520
implications of that evidence.
It's possible,

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,910
um,
to acquiesce to quickly in the face of

25
00:01:30,911 --> 00:01:35,680
evidence that it's impossible to help
people or to be so pigheaded that we

26
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:37,810
refuse to accept the constraints so they
give it.

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,540
The second thing that we need to do is I
think consider all of the options on the

28
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:47,740
table and then use our imagination to
come up with new options.

29
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,340
Finally,
we should act to fulfill human rights

30
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:57,610
and this requires a measure of grit will
or resoluteness.

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,680
We can't be inflexible and persists even
when it is actually impossible to

32
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:05,020
fulfill rights,
but at the same time we shouldn't be

33
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:10,021
complacent about it.
Since change is difficult,

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,480
people who don't think that it's
possible or desirable to fulfill human

35
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:20,950
rights probably won't try hard to do so.
So hope is important for the virtue of

36
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:24,310
creative resolve.
Hope is simply believing something that

37
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,530
one desires as possible,
but not certain.

38
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,010
Still,
even when we lack a kind of hope,

39
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:34,210
I think we should have the virtue of
creative resolve as long as there is not

40
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:37,600
conclusive evidence that fulfilling
human rights is impossible.

41
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,960
So the kind of hope we need is a radical
hope in the face of uncertainty.

42
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,910
We must persist and exercise our moral
imaginations to help people meet their

43
00:02:48,911 --> 00:02:52,690
basic needs.
But the reason we should have creative

44
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:56,470
resolve is this.
The ground for the human rights is

45
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,070
protecting everybody's ability to live a
human life.

46
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,620
And it's really important that we do
that.

47
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:03,700
So we should try hard.

48
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,790
I think the imperative to try hard is
particularly compelling given that

49
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,720
there's a lot of psychological evidence
that people don't try hard enough.

50
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,090
They tend to search to,
to uh,

51
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,240
not far enough for solutions to
problems.

52
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,980
And many people seem to have a narrow
view of possibility and feasibility.

53
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,130
Assuming tight timeframes and financial
constraints when we imagine ourselves

54
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:32,830
succeeding and tasks were often more
likely to do so.

55
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,890
Perhaps because our imagination as a
sense of agency and lets us set plans

56
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:42,901
for the future and act to achieve them.
The crux of my disagreement with critics

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,490
of the human right to health who think
we have to ration and that the human

58
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:51,520
right has to tell us how to do that is
this.

59
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,630
I don't think that's what the human
rights health has to do,

60
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,530
or even that it should rather.
I think it does something much more

61
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:03,580
important for us.
I think it inspires us to do our best to

62
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:08,581
help everyone meet their basic needs.
Okay.

63
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,750
But if we do have to ration,
here's what I think.

64
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,600
I think creative resolve can help us do
that.

65
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,530
I think it can help us find better ways
of helping more people.

66
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,370
We can't simply build hospitals in the
city rather than also in the countryside

67
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,110
because it's most cost effective to do
that.

68
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,400
Everybody has a human right to health
and if we think creatively enough about

69
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:34,250
how to do it,
we may be able to help everybody.

70
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,540
Okay,
so there's two sides to this virtue.

71
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:44,500
On the one side,
we should try very hard to help people

72
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,540
fulfill their human rights.
On the other side,

73
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:50,890
we don't have to try when it's
impossible or impermissible to do that,

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,750
but I'm going to stress and I have been
stressing the positive or commitment

75
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:57,670
side of the virtue.
For this reason,

76
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,320
millions of people around the world are
suffering and dying every year from

77
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:06,340
poverty related causes,
and it's not as if there's millions of

78
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:10,690
people trying to help them.
I believe we need to try harder,

79
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,420
try harder,
try harder.

80
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,110
I think we need to find both the
resources and the political will to do

81
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:25,111
this
and like Martin Luther King,

82
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,040
we should refuse to believe that the
bank of justice.
