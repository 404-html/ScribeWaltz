1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,390
Yeah,

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,000
people often ask me how my parents
influenced me and I can't give a neutral

3
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:17,910
answer to that because I very much
influenced by saying by Hans,

4
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:21,600
I think that the biggest influence that
parents have on their children is at the

5
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:26,430
moment of conception.
I think that the people often attribute

6
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:30,840
far too much to parental upbringing.
There's a fair amount of data,

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,200
uh,
from my field that not widely known,

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,540
that suggests that the effect of,
of parents in shaping intellect and

9
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:43,380
personality might even be overrated when
you see this in children of immigrants,

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,480
even if their parents never acquired the
language and culture of the adopted

11
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:52,750
country.
As long as the kids were immersed in a

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,100
peer group,
they ended up as fully competent

13
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:59,010
citizens.
Something indeed that happened to my own

14
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:00,930
father,
the children of immigrants who are

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,140
culturally utterly inept to never
managed to,

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,030
uh,
speak the language.

17
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,920
And the case of my grandmother,
uh,

18
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:10,660
we're constantly at sea and figuring out
the culture.

19
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,180
And my father grew up highly successful.
So if you would ask the question of him,

20
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:17,730
how did your parents shape you?
He would have laughed.

21
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:21,000
He shaped himself a,
I don't want to deny credit to my

22
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:25,710
parents who brought me up in a rich and
stimulating a household,

23
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,450
but I think I'd be kind of inventing a
novelistic autobiography,

24
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,790
which is I think what most people do.
When asked,

25
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:35,550
how did your parents influence you?
That having been said,

26
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,300
uh,
it was a house with,

27
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,080
with books,
with discussion,

28
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:42,150
with arguments,
with people coming in,

29
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,010
uh,
and uh,

30
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,390
uh,
challenging us with interesting ideas so

31
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:53,391
I wouldn't have traded it for anything,
but the scientist in me says that warns

32
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:58,050
against my own tendency to tell a story
and how it explained who I am today.

33
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,470
It's natural to,
to credit who you are with your parents.

34
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:07,680
It seems like an act of,
of decency or gratitude.

35
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,710
And in fact,
I often have to apologize to my parents

36
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:12,780
saying,
I really do appreciate everything that

37
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:15,990
you did to me.
It's just that the scientific data lead

38
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:19,170
me to think that parents don't shape
children as much as most people think.

39
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,400
And their attitude is I should give them
credit for their attitude,

40
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:27,840
which is we would want you to say
anything but what you believe based on

41
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:30,300
the best scientific evidence that,
uh,

42
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:33,580
that you take seriously.
So don't try to fashion your answer to

43
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:35,390
have to flatter us,
uh,

44
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,723
that,
uh,

45
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,050
is a sign of the kind of people that
they are.

46
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:43,590
They are,
I think as interested in ideas and in

47
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:46,590
providing good reasons for your ideas.
Uh,

48
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:49,200
as I am.
I don't know whether I inherited that,

49
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,420
whether they fostered in me,
but,

50
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,480
uh,
they deserve a full credit for that even

51
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:57,150
if perhaps by the standards of their
friends,

52
00:02:57,151 --> 00:02:58,650
I seem to be denying them credit.

53
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,200
And in talking about theories of the
shaping of personality,

54
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,340
I think the only way to make sense of a
nature and nurture is person.

55
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,440
Most obviously to point out that these
are not alternatives that I,

56
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:20,370
you couldn't have nurture.
That is the creation and transmission of

57
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:25,371
culture without a rich system of emotion
and learning to make sense of it.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,670
To create the culture,
to acquire the culture.

59
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:31,740
If you're faced with it,
learning it as a child,

60
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,900
uh,
and in the other direction,

61
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:39,050
it would be a pretty useless kind of
innate human nature if it couldn't take

62
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,350
in information from the environment if
it couldn't figure out the kind of

63
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:48,351
physical and social world that had been
placed in a and soaked up information as

64
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:51,500
to how to,
uh,

65
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,300
to prosper in it,
in order to.

66
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,270
So you need both a,
how do they interact?

67
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,960
Well,
that happened.

68
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,210
You have to specify,
I think,

69
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,300
the innate motivational systems,
the innate learning mechanisms that make

70
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,940
learning and transmission of culture
possible.

71
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,400
So something is an eight.
What is it?

72
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:16,401
Eight is not concrete behaviors or
chunks of knowledge.

73
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,130
What is it?
Eight is an ability to analyze the world

74
00:04:20,131 --> 00:04:23,970
and to learn in certain ways.
Language makes it a concrete.

75
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,850
We could not possibly be born with
English.

76
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,010
On the other hand,
just an ability to learn generically

77
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:34,890
isn't enough because you can take a baby
and you could take a,

78
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,490
a cat or a parrot,
give them the same environment.

79
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,920
The baby will learn to speak.
The cat won't.

80
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,740
Uh,
so something in neat must be there as

81
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,810
well.
In the case of language,

82
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:50,811
it would be a motive and an ability to
analyze the signals coming out of

83
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:57,171
someone else's mouth as being formed out
of units that have fixed meanings within

84
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:02,841
a community and competent tutorial rules
that allow new ideas to be expressed by

85
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:09,060
arranging these fixed signals in,
in different orders and combinations.

86
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,440
The brain mechanism that is equipped to
do that,

87
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:16,470
to find the words,
the nouns,

88
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:20,910
the verbs,
the phrases to analyze speech as having

89
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:23,580
that logic.
That's what's an eight,

90
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,570
a not just a generic ability to learn at
one extreme,

91
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,120
not knowledge of English.
At the other extreme.
