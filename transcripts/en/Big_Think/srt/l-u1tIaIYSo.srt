1
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,730
I've never made a mistake in my career.
Uh,

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,551
Geez,
I,

3
00:00:13,551 --> 00:00:16,170
I really do tend,
I have made lots and lots of mistakes,

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,120
but I tend to erase them,
uh,

5
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:19,620
as,
as from my,

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,610
from my,
uh,

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,860
uh,
a mind,

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,690
uh,
you know,

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,750
I mean,
every day I make a mistake as I try to

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,450
write a piece of fiction or is I try to
write a story.

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,830
Uh,
and,

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,740
and on a larger sense,
I make mistakes thinking that,

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,330
uh,
oh,

14
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:40,770
I've done this kind of thing.
Therefore of course I can do this

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,190
roughly similar adjacent thing.
I mean,

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,460
it's the mistakes of Hubris I suppose.
Uh,

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,350
but I,
you know,

18
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:50,700
it's to me,
to my mind,

19
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:53,600
it's better to make those mistakes and
saying,

20
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,290
man,
now maybe I can't,

21
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,690
you know,
a tap dance,

22
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:58,750
even though I,
you know,

23
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,390
can tell jokes,
uh,

24
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,300
it's better to make those mistakes in
the attempt to,

25
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,880
to live the amateur spirit,
if you will,

26
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,170
a then to a stick in one little silo
where one has proven oneself.

27
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,540
I mean,
the,

28
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,980
I,
I think the errors of hacked them are,

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,540
are more dangerous than the errors of
overreach.

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,920
And I've over,
I've overreached I will grant.
