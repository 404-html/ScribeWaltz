1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,920
I hope,
uh,

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,820
and I,
and I don't mean this

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,320
lightly,
but I hope that when I think about my

4
00:00:15,321 --> 00:00:17,120
contribution legacy,
that the

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,570
first thing is that my kids will say,
you know,

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,640
was pretty good guy.
Um,

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,680
and,
and,

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,630
and will quote me,
you know,

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,880
in,
in,

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,110
in,
in your dad,

11
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:32,660
always used to say,
or I remember some time when dad said,

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,870
uh,
that would be one piece.

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,990
I remember going to Rome the first time
and making a point of seeing keats's

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,650
grave and weeping.
It keeps his grave.

15
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:46,670
And I did because,
you know,

16
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,504
there it is.
I mean,

17
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,350
he craved and mortality and on his
tombstone is written here lies one whose

18
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,890
name was written water.
And you never know whether Kate's was,

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,430
you know,
I actually thought that or whether he

20
00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:01,310
was doing that,
figuring that if by doing that,

21
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,780
you know,
sort of like taking an umbrella so it

22
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:04,060
wouldn't rain.
Um,

23
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,020
uh,
whether he,

24
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,400
that was a protection or whether he was,
whether,

25
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,710
whether it was just false modesty.

26
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,480
But,
but I'd like to think that in some of

27
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:19,481
the work that I've done both in my own
writing and as the editor of Hbr,

28
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,570
that there will be a few things that
have changed some organizations for the

29
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:27,470
better,
you know,

30
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,140
when I was at,
fortunately before coming to Hbr,

31
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:33,830
I wrote two books about intellectual
capital and about the value of knowledge

32
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:37,700
and the importance of thinking of
knowledge in organizations and

33
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,190
developing knowledge assets and
developing,

34
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,500
using,
tapping into people's brains and

35
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:46,310
creativity worth.
And those have had an influence I think

36
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:49,070
along with a lot of other things.
I may have contributed to that.

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,590
But I also,
I hope that in that work and,

38
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,260
and in the work I've done at Hbr,
they'll be some people who say,

39
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:58,090
you know,
that article or that idea that,

40
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,700
that,
that,

41
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,030
that changed things that,
that,

42
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,460
that gave people some stuff that made
some lives better.

43
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:07,820
Or,
or even ideally some organizations,

44
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,240
you know,
I'm a change changed the practice of

45
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:15,500
management in some permanent way so that
we stop screwing things up quite as

46
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,310
often as we did.
