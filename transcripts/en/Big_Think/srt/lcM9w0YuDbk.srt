1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,390
Lincoln suspended the writ of Habeas
Corpus a number of times during the

2
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,820
civil war.
And at first in 1861,

3
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:23,821
he suspended it first along the railroad
line between New York,

4
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:26,650
Philadelphia,
and Washington,

5
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,560
because there were riots going on in
Penn,

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,100
in,
in Maryland,

7
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:33,070
people trying to block troops coming
down to protect Washington.

8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,400
So in a sense,
at first it wasn't a military district,

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,560
um,
and uh,

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,840
you know,
it was part of a war,

11
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:43,390
you know,
and later the writ of Habeas Corpus of

12
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:47,530
suspended for the whole country.
And certainly they were abuses of civil

13
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:49,360
liberties on the Lincoln.
No question about it.

14
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:52,510
People were arrested who just for giving
speeches,

15
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,060
criticizing the war,
they were newspapers temporarily

16
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:57,820
suspended.
Now we should not think that Lincoln was

17
00:00:57,821 --> 00:00:59,350
a dictator,
a tyrant.

18
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,650
There was great criticism all through
the war of him.

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,230
And the elections went on.
Nobody said,

20
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,510
let's suspend the elections because you
know,

21
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:08,344
the war is on.

22
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,380
Um,
but certainly I think Lincoln

23
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:16,381
established a dangerous precedent that
the constitution doesn't really apply in

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,970
wartime.
And now,

25
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,800
unlike our recent president,
Lincoln directly address this question,

26
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:25,270
he went to Congress.
He said,

27
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:27,970
I may have stepped over the line here.
Here's my problem.

28
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:30,010
Here's my situation.
I was faced with this thing.

29
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:35,370
Do I abide by the law and let the whole
country fall apart or do I violate this

30
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:39,550
one law and therefore save the whole
country?

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,640
Well,
that's a difficult question to answer.

32
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,200
You know,
and there is no simple answer,

33
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:46,780
but at least Lincoln put it on the
agenda.

34
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:48,490
He said,
this is a serious problem.

35
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,160
President Bushes never even admitted
that as any kind of problem.

36
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,730
He just blindly goes his own way,
acting if there is as if there is no

37
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:56,530
constitution.
Um,

38
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,540
now the other thing is in the civil war,
the United States face the greatest

39
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:04,430
crisis in its history and the greatest
threat to its,

40
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:06,070
its existence as a nation.

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,790
Uh,
the attack of nine 11 was a tragic

42
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,920
thing,
but it didn't threaten the existence of

43
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:15,310
the United States.
And there is no thought that al Qaeda

44
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:18,340
today is actually going to overthrow the
government of the United States.

45
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:19,960
They can commit,
you know,

46
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:21,110
heinous acts,
but they,

47
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:22,660
they,
they're not going to take over the

48
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:25,990
government donald to Osama bin Ladin
will be president anytime soon.

49
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,410
So we don't face the kind of threat to
our national existence that Lincoln

50
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:32,950
faced.
Uh,

51
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:36,460
on the other hand,
history shows that almost any government

52
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,540
conducting a war,
we'll find the constitution and

53
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,450
inconvenience and we'll try to get
around it.

54
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:46,540
And this has happened during World War
One with the suppression of freedom of

55
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,510
speech.
It happened in World War Two with the

56
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:52,120
internment of Japanese Americans.
So,

57
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,260
you know,
what is the lesson?

58
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:58,030
It's simply that we have to be very
vigilant about our liberties and that

59
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,123
you,
you know,

60
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,820
to realize you can conduct a war and
still respect civil liberties.

61
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,610
Lincoln is saying,
and this is a democratic view,

62
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:13,870
if people think I have abused my power
or have not conducted the war properly

63
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:15,820
or intelligent leave,
they'll vote me out of power.

64
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,460
That's what democracy is.
It gives you a chance to boot the guys

65
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:19,660
out.
Uh,

66
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:24,040
and Lincoln ran for president reelection
in 1864,

67
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,710
and even though he won a very large
majority,

68
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:30,490
we should not forget that in August,
not long before the election,

69
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:35,260
Lincoln and most politicians thought he
was going to lose that the war was at a

70
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:37,480
stalemate.
There was a great deal of discontent.

71
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,330
Lincoln and the Republican Party thought
he was going to lose.

72
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:41,920
In fact,
there were people who came to and said,

73
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,830
you've got to rescind the emancipation
proclamation.

74
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,250
People think that it is prolonging the
war,

75
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,850
that if you tell the south,
come back and you can keep slavery,

76
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,840
they'll come back now.

77
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,780
But if you say,
come back and you've got to get rid of

78
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:58,360
slavery,
that is just making them fight longer.

79
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,940
So rescind the emancipation
proclamation.

80
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,470
Lincoln said,
I cannot do that.

81
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:06,070
I would be damned,
and time and eternity or something like

82
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:07,360
that.
In other words,

83
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,270
you know,
he wasn't willing to do quote unquote

84
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:11,104
anything.
He,

85
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,990
anything that might be done to get
reelected.

86
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,550
The problem with Lincoln's quote though,
is that in the midst of a war,

87
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,780
it often is quite popular to trample on
civil liberties.

88
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:24,280
You know,
many of the things that President Bush

89
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,840
has done,
if had popular support,

90
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:28,630
rounding up people with,
I'm Muslim names,

91
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,390
uh,
chucking them into jail with no charge,

92
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:33,970
throwing away the key holding people at
Guantanamo.

93
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,590
Um,
you know,

94
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,620
when people are frightened,
they are willing to support serious

95
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:44,860
infringements on other people's civil
liberties.

96
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,390
Civil liberties are not supposed to be
subject to popular vote.

97
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,920
They are in the constitution.
They are the protection of minorities.

98
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,170
The person who holds popular views,
his freedom of speech is never in

99
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:01,570
question.
It's the person who's the dissenter,

100
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:05,440
who has unpopular views.
So you don't put that up to a popular

101
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:06,730
vote to say,
well,

102
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:09,970
should this guy be able to give a speech
criticizing the war?

103
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,381
A lot of people say,
no,

104
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:12,730
we shouldn't.
So,

105
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,860
you know,
Lincoln's view of democracy in a certain

106
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:16,270
sense is right.
But on the other hand,

107
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:20,470
it doesn't really reflect the fact that
civil liberties are the protection of

108
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:24,550
minorities against majorities,
and therefore they can't be just

109
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:26,380
subjected to majority vote.
