1
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,130
Education is in and of itself a personal
benefit,

2
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,150
personal,
right,

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,730
actually,
that people have in a democratic

4
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:20,200
society.
Uh,

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,800
so before we get to a discussion of
benefits,

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,680
let's talk about education as a right.
Each person in a democratic society

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,560
as a right from the earliest age,
let's say age three all the way through

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,950
and including
couch

9
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,510
to have a fully funded paid education.
This should be one of the foundational

10
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,490
purposes of government.
Now,

11
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:55,491
when a child has the chance from the
earliest age age to learn languages

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,260
to learn English communication skills,
they then become able to participate in

13
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:10,950
a community.
And as young people grow,

14
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,070
that community keeps expanding from
this,

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,120
from the village to the city,
to the world.

16
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,860
We need to have our young people the
best educated in science and language

17
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,180
and the arts and music and literature.
Um,

18
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,050
technology.
I mean there's so many different areas

19
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:37,020
of human endeavor that our children
should have the chance to excel it.

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,000
But you know what?
Check out the cost of tuition and Iowa.

21
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,060
My friends ask yourself how many
families are being excluded from having

22
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:51,630
their young people be able to go to
school because they just can't afford

23
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:53,820
it,
and then let's talk about the world.
