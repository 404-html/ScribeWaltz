1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,740
Yeah,

2
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,260
what used to be called a conservative
Republican and a conservative meant you

3
00:00:18,261 --> 00:00:22,060
were a fiscal conservative,
you wanted a strong national security

4
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:26,020
and defense policy and you want it
limited but meaningful government after

5
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:28,150
all,
everyone wants government in their lives

6
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:29,990
when you step on an airplane.
Uh,

7
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:33,850
but conservative Republican now has come
to mean something quite different to

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,100
talk about a family,
conservatives and social conservatives.

9
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:42,580
And that's certainly not me.
And in fact I'm defined by that set is a

10
00:00:42,581 --> 00:00:45,000
rhino Republican in name only.
