1
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,820
I think we've got a lot of scientists
working in the United States,

2
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:13,780
certainly already.
Um,

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,430
would we like to have more funding?
Of course everybody wants more funding

4
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:19,450
for their particular area.
You know,

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,590
if I were in the theater,
I'd been in demand more government

6
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:23,610
funding for,
you know,

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,500
theater productions.
Um,

8
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:27,120
so yeah,
more money would be nice.

9
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:32,121
But I think the real role that the
president can play in this broader kind

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,520
of theme of Science Literacy is in
education using the presidency as a

11
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:41,970
bully pulpit to get out the message that
science is important.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,310
It's not just something that's done by
the scientists,

13
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,740
for the scientists,
it's done by the scientists who were

14
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:51,690
citizens for everybody else in the
country and it with the collaboration of

15
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:55,140
everybody else in the country because at
least in terms of a government supported

16
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:56,880
science,
it's paid for by the rest of the

17
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:58,410
country.
So,

18
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:00,480
you know,
I think scientists have a role to play

19
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:04,200
as well.
I think scientists should perhaps make

20
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:07,710
more of an effort to communicate with
the public at large about the work

21
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:10,620
they're doing and the implications and
why it's important.

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,910
You know,
it's,

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,240
it's perhaps easier to ask for more
money than it is to explain to people

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,220
who don't have a scientific background
why you need more money.

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,830
But I think the latter is at least as
important.

26
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,020
And you know,
it's these days,

27
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:27,350
in my opinion,
part of being a scientist,

28
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,230
but responsible somehow.
