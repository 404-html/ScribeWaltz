1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,690
The idea of why being moody could be
good for you,

2
00:00:02,691 --> 00:00:06,620
really has to do with taking advantage
of one of the biggest strengths and

3
00:00:06,621 --> 00:00:11,210
assets that women have,
which is intuition and knowing that

4
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,430
something is wrong,
feeling that something is wrong and then

5
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:16,250
optimally speaking up about it.
The first thing to keep in mind,

6
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:18,950
I think that's very important is that a
mood disorder,

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,440
which is a sort of a psychiatric
diagnosis.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,490
It's not what we're talking about.
What I'm talking about is an emotion

9
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:30,491
that comes over you and last maybe 15 to
90 seconds and then if you really feel

10
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:32,990
it and allow it to pass,
it will,

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,660
um,
moods can change minute to minute.

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,470
And someone who is moody exhibits a lot
of different moods.

13
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:42,410
And what we're talking about really is
the expression of emotion,

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,710
feeling and emotion.
I'm sitting with it,

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,410
really understanding it and then
conveying it to somebody else.

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,480
This is how I feel.
So for example,

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,690
say in the days leading up to your
period where you may feel that you're

18
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:57,200
more sensitive to your environment or
that you have a thinner skin or you're

19
00:00:57,201 --> 00:00:59,660
crying more easily or more sensitive to
rejection,

20
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,440
it's actually good to pay attention to
these sorts of things because the truth

21
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:06,500
is the rest of the month you're sort of
ceiling that over.

22
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:09,410
You're repressing it,
you're stifling it,

23
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:10,940
you're covering over,
um,

24
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:13,310
but those things are actually important.
And what's your feeling?

25
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,920
For instance,
perhaps you're dissatisfied,

26
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,670
I'm with somebody or a relationship or
something in your life,

27
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,940
but the rest of the month,
you know,

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,690
you're pretty easy,
breezy and accommodating.

29
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:28,070
But then those few days before your
period where you do start to be more

30
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,550
discerning and critical,
it's important to pay attention to that

31
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:34,520
sort of thing.
If we feel our emotions and are able to

32
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:35,900
express,
you know,

33
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:37,280
what you're doing is upsetting to me.

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,480
I think what you're doing is wrong.
Everybody benefits and hopefully

35
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,570
behaviors improve.
One of my concerns that I write about

36
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,630
and Moody bitches is that I'm worried
that because so many people now are

37
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:50,300
choosing to take psychiatric medications
and antidepressants,

38
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,780
antianxiety meds that they're tamping
down,

39
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,930
um,
how they feel and you know,

40
00:01:56,931 --> 00:02:00,350
when sometimes intuition is about having
an uneasy feeling,

41
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:01,970
you know,
something is wrong and I'm a little bit

42
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:06,971
anxious and you know,
if you stop and think about how you're

43
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:10,520
feeling and you pay attention to whether
you get anxious or not,

44
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,560
you can really take advantage of that.
The further away we get from nature and

45
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,220
from what is natural for us as social
primates,

46
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,400
the more sick and miserable we're going
to be.

47
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:24,110
I mean,
I'm seeing this in my private practice

48
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,500
in psychiatry for decades now,
um,

49
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,540
that if someone is sort of truer to
themselves and how they feel and how

50
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,850
they are,
and also doing things that are more

51
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:39,110
natural for us.
I'm like moving your body,

52
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,620
being outside,
getting some sun.

53
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,611
Um,
you know,

54
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:48,611
there are very real consequences to
moving away from nature and what's

55
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:50,420
natural for us.
