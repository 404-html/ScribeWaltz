1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,920
Who would I like to interview?
Um,

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,700
well,
I actually would like to interview some

3
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:19,180
of the leaders in developing countries,
uh,

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,080
like in South Africa for example,
uh,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,660
as one,
but that's just one of a few and try to

6
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:32,280
get them to articulate to me why they
are not doing certain things in their

7
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:37,281
country that everyone else seems to
appreciate from the outside that they

8
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:41,040
should be doing.
Why are they not paying much more

9
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,910
attention to some of the,
the suffering of the people in their own

10
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,010
country now?
They may have a very good reason for it,

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,210
but I'd like to pose the tough questions
to them as to why they aren't doing

12
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:51,420
that.
