00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,010
What question is how our happiness and
habits related.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,900
And I've been researching and writing
and thinking and talking to people about

3
00:00:07,901 --> 00:00:10,390
happiness for years.
And what I started to notice was that

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,380
habits play a really important role in
happiness because a lot of times when I

5
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:17,530
would talk to people,
there was some big happiness challenge

6
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:21,700
in their life that I realized was
actually related to some core habit.

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,110
And it wasn't that they didn't think or
know that if they got more sleep,

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,460
they feel better or that if they didn't
spend so much time on the Internet

9
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:32,620
during work,
they'd be more productive or whatever.

10
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:34,900
They had identified the change that they
want to make,

11
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:37,510
but for some reason they weren't able to
stick to that change.

12
00:00:37,511 --> 00:00:41,170
They weren't able to make that change
happen no matter how much they wanted

13
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:42,400
to,
they could see that there was a

14
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:46,360
happiness gain out there,
but they weren't able to translate into

15
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:47,050
action.

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,930
And that got me very focused on the
issue of habit change.

17
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,140
So how is it that we specifically change
a habit so that we can make these

18
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:59,290
desires,
these aims that are so pressing in our

19
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:02,050
lives?
How can we translate it into real

20
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:04,270
action,
real change in our everyday lives?

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,130
Because the fact is,
you know,

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,360
there's,
for most of us,

23
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:10,150
there's a lot of low hanging fruit.
There's a lot of things just part of our

24
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:12,100
ordinary day thinks that don't take a
lot of time,

25
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:12,934
energy,
or money,

26
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,580
that if we could do them,
they would make us happier.

27
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,430
But we really have to get ourselves to
actually follow through.

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,560
And so that's where habits come into
play.

29
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,790
Because habits are the thing that allow
you to make those changes and just put

30
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:28,030
them on automatic pilot.
They're just part of your everyday life

31
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,530
and they make you happy.
