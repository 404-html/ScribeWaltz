1
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,613
No,
I don't,

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,510
I don't think so.
I think there are too many clashes

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,280
within each of the civilizations to talk
about,

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,740
um,
um,

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:24,870
a clash of it essentially as each of the
civilizations to describe them.

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,700
Um,
uh,

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,010
but,
um,

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,830
it is true that,
um,

9
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:37,410
that when,
when I'm fundamentalists or zealots or

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,980
Orthodox Ultra Orthodox people take
over,

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,720
um,
um,

12
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,683
a,
uh,

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,780
country,
uh,

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,840
then they're there.
They will repress the moderates and the

15
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:58,111
liberals in their own camp and then we
confront them and that does,

16
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,780
that does look like a kind of us against
them.

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,290
Um,
but we always have to remember in those

18
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,870
situations,
the people who've been repressed,

19
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,520
all of the liberal and secular Afghans,
for example,

20
00:01:12,521 --> 00:01:14,050
who,
who,

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,140
who survive the Taliban regime,
but we didn't hear from them while the

22
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:23,770
Taliban were in power,
but they're there and those should be

23
00:01:23,771 --> 00:01:24,780
our,
um,

24
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,550
our allies.
And since we all,

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,830
since we always have allies in the other
civilizations,

26
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,840
um,
I think it's a big mistake to try to,

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,920
to try to describe it as a kind of war
of,

28
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,610
of,
of unified culture.
