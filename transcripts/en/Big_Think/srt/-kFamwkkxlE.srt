1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,690
The New York Police Department over the
last 12 years has made extraordinary

2
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:08,691
progress in reducing crime in New York.
Started 20 slash 25 years ago.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,940
I'm an idea that a called compstat,
which was the idea that,

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,250
um,
turn all the data that we have about

5
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:24,960
crime transparent,
let us see in infinite detail where it's

6
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:26,310
happening,
who's doing it,

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,060
um,
gives us the opportunity to then manage

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,540
a crime control very precisely and very
and very effectively and move our

9
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:42,441
resources where crime was and in fact
bring it down in extraordinary ways.

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,980
But what we also saw was that over these
last 12 years,

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,490
the move to crime control costs than New
York police department,

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,330
citizen support.
It costs the New York Police Department,

13
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,550
um,
uh,

14
00:00:56,551 --> 00:01:00,240
the support of citizens for an
incredibly important mission,

15
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:04,320
which was crime control.
We know that it's possible to have a

16
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,350
great crime control and strong citizens
support and we know that it's possible

17
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:13,080
as well to truly engage police officers
in that work.

18
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,190
When you have those three things moving
together and when you keep your eye not

19
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:21,960
only on citizens support and workforce
engagement and crime control,

20
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:24,540
but finally then on outcomes for
neighborhoods,

21
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,960
um,
and we see we measure our success by

22
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:31,380
whether people are playing in parks
where their kids can walk to school

23
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,410
safely,
then we'll have a success in a way that

24
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:36,840
we've never had before.
We've lost,

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,930
um,
a,

26
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,320
a large segment of New Yorkers,
um,

27
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,610
we know that we can get them back and we
need to and we need to,

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,640
in order to do that,
um,

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,100
will be successful with crime control
when we are able to mobilize all

30
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:59,010
segments of New York and support of it.
If we can't,

31
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:00,900
then we're not going to have the
information that we need.

32
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,580
We're not going to have the support that
we need.

33
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,070
We're,
today's witness will,

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,600
uh,
won't come forward tomorrow if they

35
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:07,680
don't see the results.

36
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,810
Uh,
so they,

37
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,850
we're in a new world today where,
um,

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,460
some of the traditional tools of law
enforcement have been taken away from

39
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:19,160
the New York Police Department by the
courts.

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,120
Um,
stop and Frisk.

41
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,170
We see the effect on the street corners
and public housing.

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,490
Trespass laws have been a very effective
tool for law enforcement because we

43
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:31,230
don't need to ask permission.
We are the,

44
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,680
we are the,
the agents of the public housing.

45
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:35,514
We can,
uh,

46
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,180
we use trespass,
summonses for that kind of control.

47
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,380
Even marijuana stops have been a way of
control.

48
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Um,
those three important control tools are

49
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:53,040
now changing for the New York Police
Department and we have to find new ways

50
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,490
to assure safety and security for
citizens to do that we will need to

51
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:02,140
engage and to do that,
we will need to understand far better

52
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:07,141
than we do the sources of citizens
support and to see far better than we

53
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:08,650
ever have before.

54
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:14,070
Crime as it as it,
as it begins to emerge.

55
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,770
We know now that some of the hardest
press a precincts and boroughs of New

56
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,940
York,
that cruise small groups of kids,

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
teenagers have come together.
One hundreds of crews that are

58
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,250
responsible for a great deal of the gun
violence in New York by hearing them

59
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,260
speak,
watching them speak.

60
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,720
I'm looking at them on social media.
We understand who is doing a lot of the,

61
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,590
uh,
who's causing a lot of the damage in the

62
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:52,591
city and we've been able to address that
not by hammering entire communities but

63
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:54,850
by precision targeting,
uh,

64
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:59,260
these young people,
not all of whom were bad boys and bad

65
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:01,240
girls.
A lot of them are good kids.

66
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,060
I'm just getting mixed up with bad
stuff.

67
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,540
Um,
and instead of hammering whole

68
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,270
communities begin to work very
surgically,

69
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,320
that's the future of policing in New
York in its future.

70
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,350
That's data driven,
um,

71
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,120
that looks for the supportive
communities by,

72
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,590
uh,
by building up,

73
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,560
um,
uh,

74
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,060
our contact and our engagement by social
media,

75
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,280
by using social media also to understand
the ebb and flow of crime and disorder

76
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:34,030
and communities using it appropriately
and safely.

77
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,720
Um,
this is the new wave of policing in New

78
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,950
York is the next generation where we
measure our success now simply by

79
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:43,570
Compstat,
crime control numbers,

80
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,480
but by crime control,
plus citizen support,

81
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:49,210
plus workforce engagement plus
neighborhood outcomes.

82
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,110
And we're now able to measure all of
those in ways that we never have before.

83
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,410
And we planned to so that we,
as we achieve crime control,

84
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:02,370
we lift support and we lived in a
workforce engagement and we achieve

85
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:05,200
great results for neighborhoods.
That's really our goal.

86
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:06,400
And I think what we can do next.
