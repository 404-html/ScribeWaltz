1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,900
You obviously accomplished a lot before
you made mindfulness part of your life

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,080
more than most people accomplish in
their lives.

3
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:20,081
So do you think that your clarity of
thinking has changed in the last eight

4
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:21,160
years?
Um,

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,920
and is it,
isn't mindfulness necessary for clear

6
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:28,940
thought or could you have it without it
as you did for so many years before?

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,730
Unquestionably,
mindfulness enhances,

8
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:35,910
as you've said in your book and our
clarity of thought.

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,290
Unquestionably,
both anecdotally and scientifically,

10
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,210
we can.
We can prove that point.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,600
One of the main reasons is because by
allowing us to be in the moment,

12
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,040
it means we don't stay with what just
happened and that's one of the reasons

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,080
that Phil Jackson now,
the coach of the Knicks has given for

14
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:02,100
making mindfulness mandatory as part of
the next training,

15
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:04,890
which I love.
I love having a lead athletes

16
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:07,380
incorporating mindfulness into their
training.

17
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:09,750
And the reason Phil Jackson gave is that
he said,

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,280
you're always going to make mistakes.
You know the field learning the court.

19
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,280
The question is,
can you then move on and be fully

20
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,450
present?
Otherwise,

21
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:23,100
you're going to carry that mistake with
you and your actions and your decisions

22
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:25,260
are going to be impaired because of
that.

23
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,330
Well,
the same applies to life.

24
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,430
If I'm still smarting over something
that happened that I'm not happy with

25
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,390
WHO and when come when the moment comes
from me to make another decision or

26
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:41,070
react to something new,
it's going to affect that particular

27
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:42,180
moments decision.

28
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,120
Yeah.
It's interesting that you mentioned

29
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:46,730
professional athletes.
One of the things that strikes me about

30
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,040
the mindfulness research,
and you mentioned a lot of this in your

31
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:52,460
book,
is just how broadly it's been adapted.

32
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,130
I mean it's not just athletes.
We have the military,

33
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,020
different studies with mindfulness.
You have hedge fund managers like Ray

34
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,450
Daleo saying that that's part of their
success.

35
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,310
All of these people clearly have used it
after they reach a certain elite point

36
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,130
in their career and then they use
mindfulness to homeless,

37
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:11,450
transcend,
you know,

38
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:14,180
to get a step further,
to be the athlete who's not just a great

39
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:17,420
athlete,
but who can overcome the problems in the

40
00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:20,510
moment.
Do you feel like there needs to be some

41
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:23,840
work that has to happen beforehand?

42
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,170
Not at all.
And I think with athletes,

43
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:31,171
definitely we see them integrating
mindfulness meditation training into

44
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:35,300
their coaching right away.
Uh,

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,940
I think the reason why we have so many
successful people who have accomplished

46
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:42,190
a lot,
who's burned out along the way and have

47
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:47,191
not exactly lived very mindfully is
because our culture is drenched in the

48
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,080
delusion that,
uh,

49
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,110
the only way to really succeed is to
burn out.

50
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,120
I'm standing when you go back read,
um,

51
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,500
Thomas Edison inventing,
inventing the electric bulb and talking

52
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:09,880
about how sleep is something to be
completely contemptuous towards,

53
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,170
uh,
the whole Macho idealization of sleep

54
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:16,810
deprivation and burnout.
That very,

55
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:20,620
very deeply embedded in our culture,
in our language.

56
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:23,230
You know,
we congratulate people for working 24

57
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:26,590
slash seven.
We congratulate people for being always

58
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:30,760
on.
And so we have a lot of work to do to

59
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:33,250
unravel that.
And I think that a lot of people who

60
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:37,030
have succeeded,
I have done so despite the father,

61
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,230
the burned out along the way,
not because of it and I have included in

62
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:46,231
the book a lot of people who are sort of
iconic in our culture,

63
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:51,361
like Steve Jobs saying that he came with
his best ideas that lead to the most

64
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:54,790
iconic apple products after zen
meditation.

65
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,840
And he describes it very well,
saying this was when he could hear more

66
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:00,940
subtle things.
You know,

67
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,040
the idea that gender,
you're multitasking,

68
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,670
you are more efficient,
is a complete illusion.

69
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,540
And yet so many of us believe that
that's why you walk down the streets of

70
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:15,541
New York and you see so many people who
can't walk without being on the phone or

71
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:20,020
worse walking and texting.
And I was one of these people.

72
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,970
I remember when I stopped doing that,
I started noticing things that I had

73
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:29,050
completely missed.
Like I remember going down the street

74
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:32,860
where I live in her and seeing this
beautiful building and telling a friend,

75
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,440
this is such a beautiful building.
And I said,

76
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,550
when did it go off?
She said 80 90,

77
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,720
and I wonder what else have I missed.
