4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,660
I'm Alice Rivlin and I'm a senior fellow
at the Brookings Institution.

5
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,560
I think we're in a positive the
innovation cycle,

6
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:36,500
which is definitely not over.
Uh,

7
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,950
there are lots of things happening in
new electronic,

8
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:42,110
uh,
applications in new,

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,290
uh,
healthcare applications.

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,700
Uh,
and,

11
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:50,990
uh,
that's going to power our economy going

12
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:55,370
forward and is not a moment at which I
think anyone can say.

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,480
We've run out of ideas at the moment.
We've run out of credit now.

14
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,343
We are,
uh,

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,240
a financing,
uh,

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,950
people's new ideas.
But,

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,630
uh,
we need to turn that around.

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,700
There are certainly risks of not
investing in technology.

19
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:15,750
There are bigger risks of investing in
the wrong technology.

20
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,820
Uh,
the landscape is littered with

21
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:24,180
corporations and government agencies,
uh,

22
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,220
that a revamped their computer systems,
uh,

23
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,480
uh,
quickly and,

24
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:31,830
uh,
uh,

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,100
caused more chaos than the advantage of
investing in new technology.

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,410
So the bottom line is got to do it very
carefully and have some very skilled

27
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:44,244
people doing it.

28
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,500
Computers and telecommunications have
revolutionized our,

29
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,170
uh,
the way we conduct business and the way

30
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:56,680
we conduct our lives.
Um,

31
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,783
the,
uh,

32
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,720
problems are that we're overwhelmed with
too much information and too much noise

33
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,720
going on.
I think the,

34
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:11,780
uh,
the real problem of surviving these a

35
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,760
wonderful innovations is,
uh,

36
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,170
uh,
to,

37
00:02:15,171 --> 00:02:17,810
uh,
keep a bit centered to this matters for

38
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:20,150
business.
It matters for ordinary people,

39
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,680
uh,
and,

40
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,370
uh,
not get overwhelmed and distracted by

41
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,180
the rapidity and the volume of the
information flow.

42
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,180
Technology is helping the government a
lot and could help more

43
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,150
basically,
a lot of things go more smoothly.

44
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:45,750
The government is involved in huge
information collection,

45
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,730
uh,
operations.

46
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:50,610
Uh,
it essentially runs a huge insurance

47
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:51,630
companies,
uh,

48
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,230
called social security.
A lot of information needs to be

49
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:56,970
collected and processed,
uh,

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,350
quickly.
Uh,

51
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,710
that's a certainly a change the way the
government operates.

52
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,130
One of the agencies that has had most a
benefit,

53
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:13,210
but also most trouble in getting into
the modern computer age,

54
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,820
uh,
is the internal revenue service.

55
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,550
Uh,
taxes are certainly processed more

56
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,280
quickly and efficiently than they used
to be.

57
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,860
But there's a long way to go,
uh,

58
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,490
in improving,
uh,

59
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,343
those,
uh,

60
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,710
computer systems that,
uh,

61
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,780
technology has also,
uh,

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,280
given,
uh,

63
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,120
average people more access to government
information and,

64
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,200
um,
uh,

65
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:42,790
and help.
Uh,

66
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,530
you can go on lots of websites and find
out what's available to help your

67
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:51,090
particular business or help you,
uh,

68
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,500
as a,
uh,

69
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,390
a taxpayer on a particular,
uh,

70
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,840
problem.
Um,

71
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,840
there's a long way to go.
Uh,

72
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,900
but both the federal government and
state and local governments are a much

73
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:10,381
more effective than they used to be
because they have taken advantage of

74
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:16,021
modern technology.
Most major government agencies have a

75
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:22,251
chief technology officer and ought to
have a most states and cities,

76
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,810
uh,
do as well.

77
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,550
Um,
they,

78
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,770
uh,
uh,

79
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,080
clearly technology is extremely
important to the functioning of any

80
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,990
large organization,
whether it's a corporation or a

81
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,560
government agency,
and somebody very highly qualified has

82
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:40,940
to be

83
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,773
sure.
