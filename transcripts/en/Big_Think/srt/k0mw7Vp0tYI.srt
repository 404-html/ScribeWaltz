1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,840
So millennials are a generation,
we define them as having been born after

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:08,970
1980,
so the oldest of them is in his or her

3
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:11,760
early thirties.
The youngest mid teenagers,

4
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,250
typically generations last about 20
years or so.

5
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:16,800
We don't really know.
In the back half of this generation

6
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:18,690
ends.
That's probably a 12 or 13 year old

7
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:21,540
who's somebody different,
but he or she hasn't quite come of age

8
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,970
yet.
It's a very distinctive generation and

9
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:27,210
the oldest of them has now made the
passage into adulthood.

10
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:30,810
So we know a little bit more about them
than we did eight or 10 years ago when

11
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:33,300
they first came on the scene.
Distinctive.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,200
They're very large generation.
By the time the 20 year cycle is done,

13
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:41,070
they'll probably be 80 million strong.
The largest generation since the baby

14
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:44,160
boomers,
they are very distinctive racially and

15
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:45,450
ethnically.
Uh,

16
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:50,451
they are the transitional generation in
an America that in the middle of the

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,510
last century was about 85 percent white
by the middle of this century will be

18
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:58,790
only a little more than 40 percent white
millennials are that are the most non

19
00:00:58,791 --> 00:00:59,820
white generation.

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,840
There's more than four in 10 are
nonwhite.

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,230
Uh,
this is driven by the great modern

22
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,350
immigration wave that's now about four
or five decades old,

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,430
unlike our earlier immigration waves,
which are almost entirely from Europe.

24
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,850
This immigration wave is mostly from
Latin American,

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,410
Asian,
and it's the immigrants themselves,

26
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:18,810
but more so now it's the children of the
immigrants,

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,640
uh,
the US born children of the immigrants

28
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:23,730
who make up a very heavy portion of this
millennial generation.

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,830
They're just thinking distinctive
politically.

30
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,900
Uh,
they've now,

31
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,460
they're now old enough to an,
to a vote it in two or three

32
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:32,570
presidential elections.
And they were a very big part of both of

33
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,460
President Obama's victories,
uh,

34
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,580
by our calculation,
the Pew Research Center where I work and

35
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:40,470
did a lot of the research that led to
this book.

36
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,850
They are the most democratic voting,
a generation of young adults,

37
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:47,520
of any that we have seen in 50 years,
60 years of tracking,

38
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,750
of voting patterns.

39
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,180
Uh,
they're very liberal in their social and

40
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:53,790
cultural values.
So some of the changes that are going on

41
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:57,300
in the country on issues like same sex
marriage,

42
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,950
marijuana,
legalization,

43
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,300
actually pretty dramatic changes in a
fairly short period of time in terms of

44
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:05,250
public attitudes.
It's the millennials,

45
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:07,140
it's the young adults who are leading
the way,

46
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,750
despite their distinctive political and
social views and voting behaviors.

47
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:16,290
However,
they are not terribly attached to the

48
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,870
Democratic Party even though they gave
big votes the Democratic presidential

49
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:20,380
candidates.
Uh,

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,950
when we ask adults of all ages,
uh,

51
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,440
are you a Democrat or Republican or an
independent?

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,830
Millennials have 50 percent of
millennials say I'm independent.

53
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,580
We've never seen that high a share from
any age cohort.

54
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,820
We see a similar thing when we ask about
their religion or you know,

55
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,940
what are you?
Protestant,

56
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,790
Catholic,
Muslim,

57
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,624
Hindu,
Jewish,

58
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,750
a record share of millennials say on
nothing in particular.

59
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,350
And there's a third anchor institution
of society,

60
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:48,630
if you will,
that millennials are not attached to.

61
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:52,110
And that's a little old 5,000 year
institution called marriage.

62
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,460
Uh,
so of today's 18 to 33 year old is only

63
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,070
about a quarter are married.
If you go back to older generations,

64
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,150
they were the same age,
five and 10,

65
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:03,430
six and 10.
The oldest generation,

66
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:08,110
more than six and 10 were married.
I think the slow walk toward marriage

67
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:12,310
and the and the disassociation from
anchor institutions I think are

68
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:15,550
explained by first their economic
circumstances.

69
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,330
Another distinctive thing about this
generation is they're the first in

70
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:23,290
modern American history and perhaps the
first in American history that at least

71
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,390
so far we don't know how their story
ends,

72
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:28,900
but we know how the story of their
economic lives have begun and at least

73
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,420
so far,
they're the first generation in modern

74
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:34,660
times that is doing less well
economically than their parents'

75
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,710
generation on any way you measure it,
whether it's income,

76
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,630
whether it's wealth,
whether it's poverty,

77
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:42,460
whether it's employment,
unemployment,

78
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,060
all the classic measures and you correct
for inflation and you'll make it an

79
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,380
apples to apples comparison.

80
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,500
They're doing less well.
I.

81
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,540
The fact that they're doing less well
means a lot of them.

82
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,690
When we asked them who those were,
who aren't married,

83
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,780
would you like to marry almost seven in
10 say yes.

84
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:01,060
Why haven't you gotten married?
Well,

85
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:01,990
look at me,
you know,

86
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,520
I don't have a job,
I don't have a career,

87
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:05,920
I don't have the economic foundation to
get married.

88
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,580
Um,
and that will reverberate in interesting

89
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:12,580
ways as they mature into middle age and
beyond.

90
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,120
And then finally,
uh,

91
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,640
perhaps if not the most distinctive
thing about this generation,

92
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:21,910
certainly one of the most distinctive
things is they are first generation of

93
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:24,940
digital natives.
So they are the only age group of adults

94
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:29,320
now for whom those,
these amazing gadgets we now all hold in

95
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:32,920
our hand and we all take for granted
that with three clicks you can,

96
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,550
you can access the sum of all human
knowledge and frankly these days,

97
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:39,040
if it takes you a third click,
you're wondering what takes so long.

98
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,460
So somebody my age,
this is jaw dropping,

99
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:46,570
it's still jaw dropping every time I
access these information platforms and

100
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:47,980
do it in mobile sites.
And,

101
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,910
and I'm just amazed,
these young adults are not amazed.

102
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:53,800
It's the,
it's the only world they've ever known.

103
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,350
And,
and they,

104
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,480
they are carnivores in terms of their
habits with,

105
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,310
with these information systems,
not just for information acquisition,

106
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,620
but for the creation of networks.
They organize their social lives around

107
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:10,570
these networks.
They can build their own tribes.

108
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,050
Somebody more clever than me,
described them as a pri.

109
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:16,310
Copernican generation,
uh,

110
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,010
the universe really does revolve around
them because they can build their social

111
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:24,400
networks and they can place themselves
at the center of their social networks

112
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:27,520
because their social networks are built
around the things they care the most

113
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:28,870
about,
whether it's their hobbies,

114
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,810
whether it's their work,
whether it's the games I like to play,

115
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:34,060
whether it's information seeking in all
the rest.

116
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,240
This behavior has led some to suggest
that it's a narcissistic generation.

117
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:42,700
My own view is that that's a bum rap.
Uh,

118
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:47,200
I think it's all about the new platforms
and it's all about the human condition.

119
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:50,740
And if you have the ability to kind of
place yourself at the center of the

120
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:52,600
universe,
you will take it.

121
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:54,850
I think it's,
it's empowering.

122
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,220
It may lead to another trade of the
millennials.

123
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:00,230
They're somewhat distrustful of other
people.

124
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,490
And it may be because as they navigate
the online world,

125
00:06:03,491 --> 00:06:06,520
it turns out not everybody is exactly
who they say they are.

126
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:08,470
And there's a,
there's a certain wariness about this

127
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:11,710
generation and I think there's an
interesting question about whether the

128
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,240
networks that they build online with
their,

129
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:19,270
the median millennial has a 250 a quote
unquote friends on facebook.

130
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,870
Somebody my age or older has only a one
fifth,

131
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,200
that amount of friends and many fewer of
us are on facebook.

132
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,330
So,
you know,

133
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,190
discuss among yourselves.
Has there been a quantum leap in human

134
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:31,030
friendliness,
uh,

135
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:35,200
over the fast few generations?
Or is it simply that the new platforms

136
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,680
create new behaviors?
Uh,

137
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:39,790
and,
and new ways of organizing your social

138
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,080
life?
It's clearly the latter.

139
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,080
I think an interesting question.
I don't think we know the answer to it

140
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:47,470
yet,
is as millennials age more into,

141
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,180
into middle age as they probably age
into some of the more traditional anchor

142
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:54,820
institutions of society,
marriage,

143
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,120
children,
home ownership and all the rest.

144
00:06:58,121 --> 00:06:59,710
And these things are all happening more
slowly.

145
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:03,280
For millennials,
will they establish a more of an offline

146
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:07,030
network that begins to resemble the
networks and the affiliations and

147
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:09,790
associations that their parents and
grandparents at all?
