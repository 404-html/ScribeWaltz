1
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,790
Terms of what we need for this planet to
have a future,

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,640
um,
and solve these big issues before it's

3
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,920
too late.
We need two things.

4
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:21,850
We need this new methodology of some
kind that I mentioned earlier,

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,450
uh,
and bringing up a new methodology of

6
00:00:25,451 --> 00:00:26,910
global problem solving,
whether,

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,850
whether it's the global issues network
idea that I mentioned or some other idea

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,870
that is for the heads of states to
deliver or the prime ministers of this

9
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:39,730
world to deliver on a.
and individuals in that area can be

10
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:42,460
active as voters,
as lobbyists,

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,780
as civil society and help push towards
that direction.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,680
But the main way in which individuals
can help is with regard to the second

13
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:55,660
thing.
We need to have a future on this planet.

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,050
And that has to do not with
methodological changes,

15
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:03,790
but with mindset changes.
The type of individual we need from

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,180
Iran,
uh,

17
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,370
is an individual who feels that he or
she is first global citizen.

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,190
Second,
only a national citizen.

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,100
And third,
only a local citizen.

20
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,840
Right now we have it the other way round
in the other way round is deadly for

21
00:01:19,841 --> 00:01:24,700
this planet.
And so we should all try to,

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,290
through education systems,
through our children's,

23
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:31,000
who the next generation pushed for that
sort of mindset.

24
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,780
Because without that new mindset,
that global citizenship mindset,

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,860
even a new methodology like the one I
described would not be enough.

26
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:40,450
You need the combination of the two.
