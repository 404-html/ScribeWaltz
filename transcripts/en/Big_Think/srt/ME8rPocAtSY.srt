1
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,480
The only overarching purpose or
direction that I can think of for

2
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,490
mankind as a whole is very well
expressed in the definition of humanity,

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,020
uh,
that Pierre Teilhard de Short on

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,430
provided.
Now he was a Jesuit priest who,

5
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,730
uh,
lived in China for a long time and was a

6
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:29,160
kind of an anthropologist.
His,

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,250
his definition of humanity was evolution
become conscious of itself and it's a

8
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:38,250
very powerful point of view if you think
about it.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,960
My sense of humanity as a whole is
that's what it is.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,750
We are alive,
become conscious,

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,470
uh,
and therefore become able to understand

12
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:51,920
what we're doing to set goals and they
all.

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,670
And that I think is possibly unique in
the universe.
