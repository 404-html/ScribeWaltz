1
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,010
It's interesting that modern jazz
composers,

2
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,910
some names at a middle that come to
mind,

3
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,630
people like John Coltrane when shorter,
um,

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,170
there was always directly,
I'm Sandra,

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,460
I'm a n,
a deep appreciation and even a very deep

6
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:32,710
intuitive understanding of modern
physics.

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,180
I'm into their music.
And one of the things I like to do for

8
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:39,700
fun is actually look for those
connections.

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,540
Like literally I talked to music
composers and it's like this hobby of

10
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:48,541
mine where I will take a culture in song
or the chord changes and try to relate

11
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:53,240
it to music theory.
I'm at I'm,

12
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,940
and physics.
So one thing I found interesting is the

13
00:00:57,941 --> 00:01:00,430
notion that culture and came up with was
something called,

14
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,030
there was a,
a sort of a musical and a musical

15
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:08,710
illusion device in saxophone plane.
See a saxophone can play more than one

16
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:10,160
at a time.
Um,

17
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,100
it's monophonic instruments.

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,890
So,
but what culture was able to do was to

19
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:18,700
come up with illusionary,
reflects on the saxophone record that,

20
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,090
and it was called sheets of sandy color
sheets of sound.

21
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,900
Or another thing that he did was he
figured out ways in which you can go to

22
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:29,140
higher notes that the sex is naturally
wasn't built to make

23
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,600
and this user's ideas in physics like
nonlinearity for example.

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,580
Um,
you know,

25
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,300
that there isn't always a one to one
correspondence between a wave and a

26
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,170
note.
And I mean,

27
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,083
uh,
you know,

28
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,420
um,
one wave,

29
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,610
if I add two waves together,
I get a third wave.

30
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,980
There's not always a one to one
correspondence.

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,110
That's the difference between linear and
nonlinear.

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,500
And since music is way of cultural,
is able to figure out techniques to do

33
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:55,240
that,
ways in which,

34
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:57,610
you know,
you can hear more than one note at a

35
00:01:57,611 --> 00:01:58,444
time.

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,320
And how's that relate to physics?
Well,

37
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,070
quantum mechanics is exactly an example
of that,

38
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:07,170
that a political really can be that if
there is a probability incentive,

39
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:11,700
a particle being here or here,
then in a sense it's,

40
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,320
you know,
you can think of it as occupying in two

41
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:16,780
places at the same time until you go and
measure it.

42
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,850
Okay.
And the question is,

43
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:21,310
well that's hard to get your mind
around,

44
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,730
but in a sense that's what the sheets of
sound Coltrane was doing was like,

45
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,150
because you are playing in many ways,
many different notes on an instrument

46
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:36,010
that can only play one note at the time,
but there's this overall effect in which

47
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,040
all those notes of coexistence.
So what I'm getting,

48
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,930
what the sheets of sound is going to be
switching between different individual

49
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:49,870
notes.
So for example,

50
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,060
I'm going to play a d,
I got,

51
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,990
I want my horn,
but

52
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,490
right and I'll play a g,
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,743
All right.
And that's the.

54
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,890
See if I play them very quickly for
alright.

55
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,580
But if culture and figured out
alternative fingerings,

56
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,040
why plan those notes in a rapid
succession that you get an effect?

57
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:16,874
Um,
it sounds like.

58
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,900
So that's kind of the example of sheets
of som I'll pissed him off was basically

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,560
the sax normally can just go up to 30
this high f sharp.

60
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,771
That's it,
you know,

61
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:51,771
that's a high f sharp for me.
But then you can go further by using a

62
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:56,940
nonlinear effect by using your diaphragm
down here,

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,320
by forcing the resonance resonance from
down here so I can go up to my highest

64
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,163
sharp.

65
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,903
Hello.

66
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,700
Actually,
I'm working.

67
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:46,910
Working

68
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,650
on a little album.
Project is almost done and I'm,

69
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,350
the title of the album is call and a lot
of the songs inspired by,

70
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,800
you know,
my love for grid cool ideas in physics

71
00:04:57,801 --> 00:05:00,380
and how it's connected to jazz music in
particular,

72
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,260
but actually it has a lot of it,
it,

73
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,770
it's,
it also explores the idea of diversity

74
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:09,950
and creativity.
So it uses modern rhythms like a

75
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:13,910
Brazilian beat versus a regular Tom b
versus a hip hop beat.

76
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,570
So it uses modern rhythms with jazz
improvisations.

77
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,310
Combined it with themes,
let's say I'm and impressions I'm having

78
00:05:22,311 --> 00:05:25,640
to do with cosmology and particle
physics and string theory and the title

79
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:29,670
of the album will be called mathematics
because when I grew up in the bronx in

80
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,110
the eighties hip hop music,
um,

81
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,770
there was a part of rap music were guys
who battled each other on the streets.

82
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,360
Um,
and you know,

83
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,490
and
sometimes the battle and we'll go into,

84
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,770
you know,
the subject matter would be talking

85
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:48,550
about science for example,
and they even called it dropping

86
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,910
science.
I'm like Eric,

87
00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:53,360
B and Rakim.
And so I used to take the bus home from

88
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:55,280
school and these guys would be on the
back of the bus,

89
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,890
you know,
rapping,

90
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,810
battling each other,
drop in science,

91
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,180
so to speak.
And when one day,

92
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:03,290
you know,
I heard someone say,

93
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,490
yeah man,
I got,

94
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,520
I got enough mathematics.
So it also captures a big part of my,

95
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,920
you know,
what inspired me was that I was already

96
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:17,510
living in us in sort of a sign that this
rapping and improvisational rapping and

97
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,430
talking about,
you know,

98
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,720
things are voluntary in the universe and
stars exploding that I'm like the star

99
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,610
exploding,
you know,

100
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,090
and you know,
things like this planet rock Afrika

101
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,010
Bambaataa wind the first rap songs out
there.

102
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,230
Um,
so the title of mathematics sort of

103
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,430
brings it all together.
