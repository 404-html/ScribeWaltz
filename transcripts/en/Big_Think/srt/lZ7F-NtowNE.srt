1
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,300
I was closeted for most of my life,
my adult life.

2
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:16,770
I wanted to be an actor,
which alone just that alone was,

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,690
um,
some people thought a crazy aspiration

4
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:27,050
to have because I am Asian and Asians,
uh,

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,910
first of all,
our adult have many opportunities to get

6
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:33,730
cast.
Plus the fact that,

7
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:35,200
um,
uh,

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,980
there were stereotypes that we were
saddled with either the cold,

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,960
heartless,
a killer,

10
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,520
uh,
the,

11
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:48,970
uh,
inscrutable a person that's got

12
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:53,971
something always going on in the back of
his mind leading to suspicion that a

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,840
where we could be spies or the survival,
the quiet obsequious or the buffoon,

14
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,550
all very unattractive stereotypes.
So why I would go into acting,

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,540
but something that,
well,

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm the black sheep of the family.
My parents thought it was absolutely

17
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:17,560
crazy,
but they knew how passionate I was.

18
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,820
And to get cast with first,
uh,

19
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,650
this uh,
uh,

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,990
ethnic,
uh,

21
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,720
barrier,
a hurdle for me to cross A.

22
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,950
I didn't want to add another one of
being gay gay people.

23
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,210
We're not a cast or if they were exposed
as gay,

24
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,170
their career is faded.
I remember when I was a teenager,

25
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,560
there was a very good looking,
handsome actor named Tab Hunter who was

26
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:52,960
a contract active with warner brothers
and almost every other movie coming from

27
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:57,961
Warner Brothers start tab hunter.
He was the heartthrob of America until

28
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,960
confidential,
exposed him as being gay and eventually

29
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,850
he disappeared.
That was an object lesson for me and so

30
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:14,851
I was closeted and my career was making
progress and so I did everything to

31
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:21,121
protect my career,
which meant having my guard up all the

32
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:25,780
time.
Being careful about the pronouns I used,

33
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,300
a denying some,
a good portion of who I was.

34
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,170
It was a very uncomfortable,
a way to live,

35
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,570
except when you're doing it,
it becomes a part of your normal

36
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,420
existence.
I lived that uncomfortable existence as

37
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,970
what I thought was going to be my life.

38
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,850
You know,
I used to go to gay bars in Los Angeles

39
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:57,110
back then and,
uh,

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,390
it was a wonderful place.
That guard can come down.

41
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,660
I could make friends as who I am,
and to really relax and enjoy

42
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,310
friendship,
camaraderie,

43
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,540
and a,
a wonderful evening or an afternoon.

44
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,040
But one of the older people told me that
periodically the police would raid gay

45
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,650
bars and they would march the clients
out,

46
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,490
put them on a patty wagon,
drive them to the police station,

47
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,560
fingerprint them,
photograph them,

48
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,080
and their names were,
would be put on a list.

49
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,120
It was terrifying.
Their lives can be destroyed.

50
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,210
They could lose their jobs,
perhaps their families.

51
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,900
It was a horrible thing.
And what were they doing?

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,400
A criminal activity according to the law
at that time being gay was criminalized.

53
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,850
We were marched out,
put into paddy wagons and registered.

54
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,480
And I thought,
that's no different.

55
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,510
Different than what happened to me when
I was child because of this face,

56
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,970
because we look like the people that
bombed Pearl Harbor.

57
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,080
We were put into prison camps,
guarded over by,

58
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,160
uh,
soldiers with machine guns pointed down

59
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:31,480
that is from century towers.
It was the same thing.

60
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,860
And I thought that was horrible,
was wrong,

61
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,980
unjust.
And yet that was the way we had to live

62
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,660
those few isolated moments when we could
be ourselves.

63
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,820
And then stonewall happened.
When the people they're resistant,

64
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,660
they decided they had enough.
They're not going to take it anymore,

65
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,110
and that was the galvanizing event and
society began to change,

66
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,450
and by the 21st century,
uh,

67
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,450
things were really starting to change.
Massachusetts,

68
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,610
the State Supreme Court of Massachusetts
ruled that marriage equality was

69
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,260
constitutional.
So that was the first state.

70
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,660
Two years later on the other coast in
California,

71
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,880
the People's representatives this time,
through the legislative route,

72
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,240
both houses of the California
legislature,

73
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,020
the assembly and the Senate,
passed the marriage equality bill.

74
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,920
All that,
that bill needed was a signature of the

75
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:43,921
governor to become the law of the state.
It would have been two states book

76
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,400
ending America with marriage equality.
The governor at that time happened to be

77
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,990
a movie star,
Arnold Schwartzenegger.

78
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,400
When he campaigned for that office,
he told the public,

79
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,300
I'm from Hollywood.
I've worked with gays and lesbians.

80
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,000
Some of my best friends are gays and
lesbians,

81
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,480
and persuaded by that,
a couple of my gay friends did vote for

82
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:11,834
him.

83
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,820
Yet when that bill landed on his desk,
he acted as the representative of this

84
00:06:21,971 --> 00:06:25,030
base,
the right wing of the Republican Party.

85
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,680
And he vetoed it.
I was raging,

86
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,940
but I had trained my body muscular,
holding that rage and that night brad

87
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:43,981
and I were watching the late night news
and I saw all these young people pouring

88
00:06:44,381 --> 00:06:48,510
out on the Santa Monica Boulevard,
venting their rage on our no

89
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:53,511
Schwartzenegger and we felt the same way
and it got us to thinking and talking

90
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:03,270
and Brad and I discussed it.
I was 68 years old by that time and I

91
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:06,784
thought,
well,

92
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:12,150
I want my life to have some meeting.
I want the time that I have left to do

93
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:18,400
something about that aspect of who we
are.

94
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,150
And so I spoke to the press for the
first time as a gay man and I blasted

95
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,510
Arnold Schwarzenegger's veto and what I
thought of my career,

96
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,590
I thought it was going to go on the
downhill side.

97
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,250
The opposite happened.
It just lost and I've been working more

98
00:07:41,621 --> 00:07:45,670
since coming out then I had been when I
was closeted.
