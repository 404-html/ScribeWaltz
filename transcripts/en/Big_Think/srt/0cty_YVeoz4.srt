00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,500
I do occasionally worry about the 
academic world,

2
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:11,334
or at least parts of the academic world 
being really mired in what some friends 

3
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:17,100
of mine and I tend to call the cult of 
irrelevance.

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,323
This idea of wanting to work on topics 
that are of great interest to you and 

5
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:25,020
three of your friends and to people at 
another university.

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,390
Um,
and I think this is an abdication of our

7
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:28,224
responsibility as intellectuals.
We should be grappling with really big 

8
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:35,730
questions as much as we can and 
questions that are of great importance,

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,593
right?
That's why society allows us to have 

10
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:39,654
these very privileged positions as 
intellectuals are college professors or 

11
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,334
whatever.
And the way we should be paying society 

12
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:50,541
back is by using that to try and make 
the human condition better.

13
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:52,410
Now,
we're not all going to agree,

14
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:53,244
but that's okay because we're more 
likely to collectively reach a wise 

15
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:57,744
position if we all think hard and then 
argue about it and do so in public 

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,213
whenever possible.
