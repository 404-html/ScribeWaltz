1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,200
One of the economic and cultural changes
that we've seen pretty dramatically in

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:06,150
the last few decades is the sheriff,
lung,

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,320
young adults who never leave home even
after they go through their schooling or

4
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:12,960
at some point in their young lives,
boomerang back home.

5
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:17,280
And we estimate that more than 40%,
nearly half of all millennials have

6
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:18,660
either never,
never left,

7
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:21,060
never launched,
if you will or at some point have

8
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:23,520
boomeranged back home.
You know,

9
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:26,260
he can't find a job if you're,
if you're underemployed,

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,480
if you're at a non nonpaying internship,
all those sorts of journeys,

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,080
a mom and dad's home,
it ain't bad place to hang out.

12
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:36,400
You know,
the refrigerator is usually stocked and

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,250
you don't have to put coins in the
laundry.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,210
And interestingly,
um,

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,570
I think there was,
in my generation,

16
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:45,000
there was some stigma attached to that,
uh,

17
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:46,890
you know,
get on with your life already ready for

18
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:47,724
goodness sake.

19
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,550
You know,
we've done some surveying of both the

20
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:54,480
parents have such young adults and young
adults themselves looking for tension

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,520
within those homes,
looking for conflict,

22
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:58,290
looking for stigma.
And frankly,

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,840
we don't find that much in part because
it has,

24
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,020
it has become more commonplace and
people sort of understand.

25
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:04,854
Yeah,
that's,

26
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,640
uh,
that's,

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,910
that's the nature of the slow passage
into adulthood.

28
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,710
Uh,
you know,

29
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,070
there are societies in the world and,
and a southern Europe,

30
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:18,300
particularly Italy come to mind where
culturally young men have been living

31
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:19,610
with their mothers,
uh,

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,020
you know,
in into their thirties and forties.

33
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:26,460
A bum bocce on is big baby and mommy smo
his mamma's boy.

34
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,250
And some of this is cultural,
uh,

35
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:33,630
as some of this is clearly economic and,
and Europe frankly has the same

36
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:37,080
challenges with not enough jobs for
young adults that we have.

37
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:39,030
So a lot of the world is,
is,

38
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:40,170
is going through this.

39
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,030
I think the silver lining is a,
that there don't seem to be a lot of

40
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:46,380
stresses.
Again,

41
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,590
I speak as a baby boomer who came of age
in the sixties and there was a whiff of

42
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:55,080
generation war in the air.
It was a time when there was a,

43
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:55,980
uh,
you know,

44
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:58,350
there's a women's rights movement,
civil rights movement,

45
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,950
anti war protests.
There was a feeling that the older

46
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:05,940
generation had screwed everything up and
thank God w here we were to make

47
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:07,980
everything right.
There was almost a sort of a finger of

48
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:10,530
accusation pointed at the older
generation.

49
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,810
You see virtually none of that,
uh,

50
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:14,790
with uh,
within the younger generation.

51
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,670
In some ways I have a sense from our
surveys,

52
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,860
uh,
that young adults have sort of

53
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:24,630
seamlessly migrated from being the
children to their parents in many cases

54
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:28,340
to being the roommates or their parents
and they have the similar interests and

55
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:32,430
they text each other and they get on
with their lives and there's a certain

56
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:33,810
sort of resilience there.

57
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,930
That's a snapshot of a moment,
you know,

58
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:39,660
in this slower passage to adulthood.
I again,

59
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:44,340
I don't think we yet know fast
forwarding a a decade or two down the

60
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:45,200
road,
uh,

61
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,730
what that will mean,
what that will mean for the family

62
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:52,350
formations of these young adults.
I suspect what it does mean is that the

63
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:56,550
intergenerational interdependence that
we see in these families is likely to

64
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,220
last a,
there is no question that families stay

65
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,050
closer to each other father into the
life.

66
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,790
Then may have been the case in the past.
And when we talk about generational

67
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:10,060
personalities,
let's acknowledge upfront we are deep

68
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,680
into the realm of generalization and
stereotype and there within any

69
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:16,870
generation,
there as many differences between

70
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:19,360
individuals as there are across
generations.

71
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:21,400
And the idea that if you're born in one
year,

72
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,520
you're a member of one generation and
therefore have one part of a

73
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,890
personality,
but you were born a year later,

74
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:30,610
you're or another generation that flies
in the face of common sense,

75
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,410
obviously.

76
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,290
Have you said that you can look at broad
patterns and we can see this with our

77
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,840
attitudinal data,
our voting behavior or economic

78
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:39,430
circumstances.
And again,

79
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,340
accepting,
accepting the caveat that these are big

80
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:44,000
generalizations.
Um,

81
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,910
there are,
there are a number of things that do

82
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:49,360
stand out in terms of the person persona
of this generation.

83
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,750
One of them is awareness.
Um,

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,160
there was a classic question in social
science,

85
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,140
uh,
about what we call social trust.

86
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,690
And the question goes very simply,
generally speaking,

87
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,370
would you say most people can be trusted
or you can't be too careful when you're

88
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:05,440
dealing with other people?
Uh,

89
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:07,750
we,
the Pew Research Center and other

90
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:11,680
research organizations have been asking
this question for 40 years and we've

91
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:16,681
never seen a generation that is as low
on social trust as millennials are.

92
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,380
So only about 19% of millennials,
the last time we asked this question

93
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:20,861
say,
yeah,

94
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,150
most people can be trusted.

95
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,900
Uh,
it's a very interesting finding because

96
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,250
millennials are also a play nicely with
other,

97
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,630
uh,
a generation.

98
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:32,140
And I think,
you know,

99
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,560
we all got that report card in
kindergarten plays nicely with others.

100
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:39,340
I think millennials must have all done
very well on that.

101
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,660
How do you square these two seemingly
opposite characteristics?

102
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:44,500
I'm not,
frankly,

103
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:45,940
I'm not sure I can,
but let me,

104
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,350
let me put forward a couple of
interesting theories to start with.

105
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:54,590
The social trust finding.
One of the things that a sociologist no

106
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,670
and psychologists have observed is that
a population groups within a population,

107
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,220
uh,
that feel vulnerable for whatever

108
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:06,550
reason,
tend to be low on social trust because

109
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:10,750
they're not well fortified to deal with
the consequences of misplaced trust.

110
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,990
So if you think about the millennial
generation and you think about their

111
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:16,220
demographic characteristics,
uh,

112
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,720
a large share are nonwhite and a large
share at the lower end of the

113
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:20,890
socioeconomic scale.

114
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,720
In both cases,
you know,

115
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,930
that places them or may place them in a,
in a,

116
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:28,680
in an attitude of vulnerability.
Uh,

117
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:32,950
and therefore you can't be too careful.
I think it's possible that the fact that

118
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:35,020
they navigate,
they do so much of their social

119
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:37,950
interaction online may lead to
awareness.

120
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,510
Uh,
it's one thing to have a face to face

121
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:43,210
friends and those sorts of relationships
where you can,

122
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,060
you have a history of people,
you can read body language,

123
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:50,110
you can do all the things that friends
tend to do when you have relationships

124
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:53,830
that are entirely mediated through an,
through an online setting.

125
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,520
Uh,
it's more complicated and I think people

126
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,720
come around the view they'd not
everybody's exactly who they say they

127
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:00,321
are.
Uh,

128
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:02,060
online.
Uh,

129
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,090
a final possibility is the way then the
very nurturing parenting norms,

130
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,170
uh,
that raised millennials.

131
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,940
Millennials came of age in the nineties
and arts,

132
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,210
uh,
in an era of global terrorism,

133
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,460
uh,
of domestic school shootings.

134
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,500
Columbine,
nine 11,

135
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,550
not a pretty horrible things that are
particularly disturbing to parents.

136
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,190
Uh,
the worry about strangers online,

137
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:32,820
online predators and all the rest.
Social psychologists would say that they

138
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:36,330
have been raised in a very protective
nurturing environment.

139
00:06:36,331 --> 00:06:39,570
It is a kind of an,
everybody gets a trophy quality to the

140
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:42,150
way millennials have been raised.
Your precious,

141
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,450
it's a mean and difficult world.
I need to protect you,

142
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,010
which may then be picked up by,
by the children raised this way.

143
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:52,200
As you better be careful,
you better be wary.

144
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,461
Uh,
again,

145
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:54,930
I,
I wouldn't push this too far,

146
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:59,430
but,
but one real world consequence that is

147
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:03,360
already observable among the millennials
is in their economic behaviors.

148
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,060
They appeared to be a risk averse
generation.

149
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,580
Now maybe that's because they don't,
they don't have money.

150
00:07:08,581 --> 00:07:12,210
They don't have the economic security
that leads to a freedom to take risks.

151
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,530
Uh,
or maybe,

152
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:18,300
maybe it's the way they've been raised,
but w w w one of the data points is a,

153
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:21,780
you know,
fidelity and other companies that manage

154
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:23,910
401k's,
uh,

155
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:28,070
and kind of have a sense of the
investment ha habits and patterns of

156
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,970
millions and millions of people who
work,

157
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:35,010
have noticed in the last five or six
years that the young adults in these,

158
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:38,730
in these 401k programs,
when they look at their investment

159
00:07:38,731 --> 00:07:40,290
choices,
uh,

160
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,250
and,
you know,

161
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:43,590
the,
the advice to the young adults is the,

162
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,341
a little bit you,
you know,

163
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:45,570
you're young,
you have time,

164
00:07:45,571 --> 00:07:46,860
be aggressive,
you know,

165
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,950
a stock portfolio over the long haul of
supposed to do better,

166
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:50,790
et Cetera,
et Cetera.

167
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,040
Uh,
many young adults are not taking that

168
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,930
advice.
I think you can see that in their

169
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:57,300
consumption habits as well.
Again,

170
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,600
either because they don't have the money
or they don't want to take on the debt.

171
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,490
Uh,
they're not buying cars.

172
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:03,570
They're,
I find houses.

173
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,930
Um,
and I think there is a kind of wariness

174
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:09,990
that cuts across a lot of dimensions of
their lives.
