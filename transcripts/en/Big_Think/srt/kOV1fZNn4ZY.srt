1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,933
Yeah,

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,340
well my advice is really to follow your
passion.

3
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:16,060
I mean study something that interests
you but also qualifies you to apply.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,440
It's a,
as I said,

5
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:19,990
NASA recruits from a wide variety of
backgrounds.

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,560
You have to have a bachelor's degree at
least in science or engineering.

7
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:23,980
But,
uh,

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,540
pick the field that you like,
you know,

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,970
um,
I know people who have applied to be

10
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:29,530
astronauts who,
who asked me,

11
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:30,490
well,
should I do this,

12
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:31,380
should I do that?
And I said,

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,620
you don't,
it doesn't matter.

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,220
The basic requirements are you have to
be in good health and you have to have a

15
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:38,110
good heart.
I mean,

16
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,840
in a technical way,
not so much be a kind person while,

17
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,220
although that helps.
But,

18
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:43,090
um,
you know,

19
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,070
study something that you like and do
well in it.
