1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,140
In 1947,
Armstrong bought a tape recorder.

2
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,930
Commercial tape recorders were new at
this point.

3
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:19,931
He was one of the first people in
America to buy one like everyone else,

4
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:22,880
if his generation who first got his
hands on a tape recorder,

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,500
he would play with it.
He bought it to tape his shows,

6
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:29,120
his live shows so that he could study
them.

7
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,900
But he started taping conversations,
uh,

8
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,920
with,
with friends,

9
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:37,910
backstage conversations.
And he also taped off all of his record

10
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:41,540
library from his home so he could travel
with it because Armstrong was on the

11
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,850
road 300 nights a year.
And he missed his records.

12
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:48,500
He loved to listen to music.
He kept the tapes because he was a very

13
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,490
self aware person,
you know,

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,890
he wrote two autobiographies of his own
and he thought deeply about the meaning

15
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:59,870
of his own experience.
So he realized fairly early on that he

16
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:02,990
was creating a kind of personal archive
of,

17
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,330
of,
of information through these types.

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,960
By the time of his death in 1971,
there were about 650 reels of tape.

19
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,530
They were kept after his death in a non
climate controlled attic at his house in

20
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:21,470
Queens.
And so although everybody who knew him

21
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:25,310
knew about the existence of the tapes,
it was generally assumed that they

22
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:28,040
wouldn't be playable by the time anybody
got their hands on them.

23
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,920
Um,
but it wasn't true.

24
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,830
Uh,
when the contents of the house became

25
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:38,831
part of the Armstrong Archive,
the archivists did digital transfers of

26
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:42,770
all the tapes and they were all playable
and they're all in,

27
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,960
in,
depending on the circumstances under

28
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:47,060
which they were recorded.
Very good sound.

29
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,320
I was the first person to write a book
about Armstrong,

30
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,260
who,
who came along after these types became

31
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:59,261
available to researchers.
And it was really an extraordinary

32
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,620
experience at Armstrong was a very
unselfconscious man.

33
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,690
So if there was ever a point at which he
was aware of the microphone,

34
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,580
so to speak,
it went away early.

35
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,480
So when you listen to these tapes,
you are stepping into a time machine.

36
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:21,500
You are eavesdropping on the private
life of a great important and

37
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,670
unselfconscious men.
Sometimes he's putting on a little show.

38
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:28,190
He does a little mock radio shows,
uh,

39
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:32,780
there are tapes where he plays along
with old records of his tapes where he

40
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:36,440
plays records for ms dot collection and
talks about them and they're fascinating

41
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:39,230
too,
but the most important tapes are the

42
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:43,430
candidate tapes where he simply,
he simply started the tape recorder

43
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,490
during a dinner party or in his dressing
room or in the bedroom at a hotel room

44
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:54,341
after the show and just let it run and
whatever he wants to talk about.

45
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:59,060
Whatever the people who are with him are
talking about is what gets taken down on

46
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,000
recorder.
So

47
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,650
I was fascinated by the idea that these
tapes might show us in Armstrong that we

48
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:08,884
didn't know.

49
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,250
In one sense they don't because
Armstrong was an unselfconscious person

50
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:18,600
and when he got onstage,
as everybody I spoke to who knew him,

51
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,450
told me what you saw was what you got.
He was what he seemed to be.

52
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,900
But in private he was more candid.
I think much more sharp.

53
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,400
I don't mean sharp is an intelligent.
I mean sharp is in,

54
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,030
in testy,
difficult sometimes because he had a

55
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:35,710
temporary.
That was something that he didn't show

56
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:39,430
it in public.
He held grudges and he talks about some

57
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:42,400
of those grudges and the tapes,
grudges against musicians he'd worked

58
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:44,140
with that he thought had double crossed
him,

59
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,980
a managers or people who booked him that
had mistreated him.

60
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,960
He talks very candidly about the
difficulties he had with the gangsters

61
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:57,400
of Chicago in 1930,
31 back when he was really having

62
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,280
serious run ins with him.
Uh,

63
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,270
he talks about his marijuana arrest in
1930 in California,

64
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,990
not a subject that you would go around
and give interviews about 1960 in the

65
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,823
United States.

66
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,060
You hear him getting high with friends.
Uh,

67
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,770
you hear him in one amazing tape trying
to get his wife into bed.

68
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,360
You hear him talking to girlfriends when
his wife wasn't around.

69
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,430
You hear him talking about racism.
You hear him talking about people he had

70
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:31,540
logged in,
music that he had loved and whatever

71
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:36,070
inhibition he felt in public about
talking about certain matters is gone in

72
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:37,320
these types.
Uh,

73
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,440
and it,
did.

74
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,850
They bring you closer to him than
anything possibly could closer even than

75
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:46,600
talking to people who knew him and I
talked to quite a few of those people.

76
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,040
It's not quite right to say that they
didn't emerge in,

77
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:57,041
in one famous episode,
he blew up in front of a reporter when

78
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,310
Dwight Eisenhower,
who was then president,

79
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:03,640
was hesitating about sending the
national guard and to desegregate the

80
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,550
schools of little rock.
He was extremely candid on that

81
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:08,830
occasion,
but by that time,

82
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,100
Armstrong was perceived as being an
accommodationist on racial matters by

83
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:19,330
younger blacks because Armstrong had the
manners of an earlier generation.

84
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:23,560
He was an entertainer.
He didn't perform in public with any

85
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:25,500
kind of confrontational edge.
Uh,

86
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,200
there were those who called him an uncle
Tom because he had,

87
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,440
you know,
some of the comic mannerisms of,

88
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,250
of somebody who had grown up with
minstrel shows,

89
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:37,240
which is perfectly natural for a man who
was born in New Orleans in 1901.

90
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,270
But in the late fifties,
he was widely perceived as being soft on

91
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:43,960
these matters.

92
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,410
Since it's not soft,
all of them.

93
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,180
When you listen to the tapes,
you realize that although he is himself

94
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,860
devoid of any kind of racist sentiment,
there's no reverse racism and Armstrong

95
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:54,980
at all.
Uh,

96
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,170
he is absolutely frank about things that
have happened to him about the anger

97
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:05,171
that he feels about episodes where he
felt that he'd been mistreated,

98
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:06,820
especially in Hollywood,
uh,

99
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,980
uh,
where he was sometimes treated as

100
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:12,440
something of a servant on the movies
that he made.

101
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,850
And he speaks about them with,
with great candor and great anger.

102
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,480
And if you already viewed Armstrong with
a proper historical perspective,

103
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,940
you're not going to be shocked by this.
But for people who,

104
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,500
who have this notion that Armstrong with
some kind of uncle Tom Listening to the

105
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:31,400
tapes as an Iro.
