1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,410
I think it's really going to be
dependent on the kinds of choices people

2
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:15,580
make.
Um,

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,700
I,
you know,

4
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:22,360
I suppose I would be,
I do more optimistic if I felt other

5
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:24,040
people were,
uh,

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,160
less irrationally optimistic.
I think people are not fully aware of

7
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:33,160
some of the risks and some of the
challenges we face and because of that

8
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:35,350
are overly complacent.
And I think that's,

9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,770
that seems to me is,
uh,

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,170
a recipe for,
um,

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,890
dramatically increasing the probability,
something very bad,

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,300
um,
bad happening.

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,370
Um,
but,

14
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:46,181
uh,
but you know,

15
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:47,860
these things are very,
it's very hard to,

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,420
it's very hard to know and you know,
it,

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,280
uh,
it's very hard to know which choices are

18
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:54,970
going to be the critical ones and how
these things are precise and work out

19
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,820
because the world's a big place.
A lot of complicated things are,

20
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,160
are going on.
Um,

21
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,660
I,
I tend to,

22
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,030
I guess my,
if I had,

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,490
if I had to makeup,
if you held a gun to my head,

24
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,240
forced me to make a prediction.
I think we're headed towards,

25
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,260
um,
you know,

26
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:14,500
20,
30 years of incredible chaos and

27
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:16,840
turmoil.
And then at the tail end of,

28
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:19,210
we will emerge with a world better than
any weekend

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,113
now.

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:25,430
Yeah.
