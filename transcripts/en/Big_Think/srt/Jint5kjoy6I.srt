1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,250
Now Tony and determinism says that the
university has a clock,

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,510
I gigantic clock that's wound up at the
beginning of time and it's been ticking

3
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:10,020
ever since.
According to Newton's laws of motion,

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:15,390
so what you're going to eat 10 years
from now on January first has already

5
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:19,210
been fixed.
It's already known using Newton's laws

6
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:22,390
of motion.
Einstein believed in that Einstein was a

7
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:25,250
determinist.
Does that mean that a murderer is a

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,560
horrible mass murderer,
isn't really guilty of his works because

9
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:32,590
it was already preordained billions of
years ago.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,060
Nine science said,
well,

11
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:35,500
yeah,
in some sense that's true.

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:41,070
Even mass murderers were predetermined,
but he said they should still be placed

13
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:44,380
in jail.
Heizer Berta then comes along and

14
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:47,320
proposes the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle and says,

15
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,540
nonsense.
There's uncertainty.

16
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,560
You don't know where the electron is.
It can be here,

17
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,060
here,
or many places simultaneously.

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,940
This of course,
Einstein hated because he said,

19
00:00:57,941 --> 00:01:00,100
God doesn't play dice with the universe.

20
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,810
Well,
Hey,

21
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,810
get used to it.
Einstein was wrong.

22
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,620
God does play dice.
Every time we look at an electron,

23
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,650
it moves.
There's uncertainty with the regardless

24
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,660
of the position of the electrons.
So what does that mean for freewill?

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,500
It means in some sense we do have some
kind of free will.

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,680
No one can determine your future events
given your past history.

27
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,010
There's always the wildcard.
There's always the possibility of

28
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:30,940
uncertainty in whatever we do.
So when I look at myself in the mirror,

29
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,760
I say to myself,
what I'm looking at,

30
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,910
it's not really me.
It looks like me,

31
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,790
but it's not really me at all.
It's not meat today.

32
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,080
Now it's me a billionth of a second ago
because it takes a billionth of a second

33
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:46,330
for light to go for a meeting to the
mirror and back.
