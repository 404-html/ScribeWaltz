1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,530
Let's talk about your four pillars for a
second.

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,650
When I was reading that description,
to me,

3
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:17,360
what came immediately to mind was a
young child that kind of the epitome of

4
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:18,200
mindfulness.
You know,

5
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:21,980
someone who has wisdom of a sort who has
wonder for sure,

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,860
who's very giving.
Because we now have a lot of research

7
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:27,680
that shows that children are naturally
very altruistic.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,780
It seems like a child is kind of the,
the most mindful person you can have and

9
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:35,090
you even quote the child is father to
the man.

10
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:39,830
You quote that poem in your book.
So I was wondering if you kind of,

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,970
if,
if you agree with that,

12
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:45,971
if you think that we should be looking
more to kind of prolong our childhood in

13
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:46,820
a certain way.

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,210
Science,
I love the idea of prolonging our

15
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:52,700
childhood.
Why making it conscious?

16
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:54,570
Cause if that's the difference,
right?

17
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:59,650
Is the fact that it's like returning to
the garden of Eden but with

18
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:03,890
consciousness,
it's a dsl yet by him about,

19
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:06,920
you know,
returning home but seeing it for the

20
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:09,360
first time.
One of the things that I,

21
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,300
I often use as,
um,

22
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,990
as a sort of example of how I want to
react to life that has to do with

23
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:22,490
genuine is the way children get angry,
upset.

24
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,350
They cry.
That's right.

25
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,900
Tamper Tantrum.
And then two minutes later it's gone.

26
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,510
And it's like a different human being.
And I think if we can be like that,

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,790
it would be just an amazing way to
experience life instead of holding on to

28
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:42,791
resentments and Angus and judgments for
yes.

29
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,670
And that affecting a whole experience of
life.

30
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,310
Do you think we need to go to kind of to
that extreme in order to be able to

31
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,170
appreciate mindfulness and incorporate
it,

32
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,940
we need to kind of experience the,
not necessarily burnout a severe as you

33
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:03,330
did,
but all of the negative things first or

34
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,970
is it possible to just sail on through?

35
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,030
Oh,
I think absolutely.

36
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:13,031
We can incorporate mindfulness from a
very early age and now increasingly we

37
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:16,220
see people,
I mean young children being taught to

38
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,230
meditate in order to have,
it's like a tool that they can use at

39
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:27,071
any point in their lives.
My two daughters made a date and they

40
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,250
encourage each other.
They text each other when one is about

41
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,560
to meditate,
to encourage the other to remember to

42
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:34,500
do,
how many days.

43
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,180
So they're using it as a tool because
even the most blessed at life is going

44
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:42,890
to include problems,
challenges,

45
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,660
tragedies,
often.

46
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,290
So if we have a tool that allows us to
return to that centered place,

47
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:56,741
we all have every religion mentioned
Zaid every philosopher,

48
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:58,550
you know,
asking me this call date,

49
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,320
give me a place to stand and I can move
the world.

50
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,380
So that place on which we can stand and
deal with whatever life brings us up to

51
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:09,130
me.
He's just

52
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,750
an incredible adventure to learn to go
back to that place and we don't do it

53
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:20,770
again and again until we can have easier
access to it.

54
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:25,760
Yeah.
