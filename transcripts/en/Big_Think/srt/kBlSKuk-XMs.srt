1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,090
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,630
you know,
when I've read

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,860
it sounds really weird,
but when I was about 10 or 11,

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,730
I stumbled across the Elliot at home.
My father had bought the great books of

5
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:25,650
the Western world and one of the first
books,

6
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,410
it was the Elian,
I had no idea what it was,

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,670
but it was a very long thing and I
thought this is the beginning of

8
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:36,120
literature,
so I'm going to read this and I

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,930
understood probably about half of it,
but it was fascinating.

10
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:44,460
It was an incredibly tense,
an interesting story.

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,020
And once I got into the whole
way that the,

12
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:49,600
the,
the,

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,600
the poems worked it with like a,
like a swash buckling mystery in a way.

14
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:57,180
So that made me feel like,
gosh,

15
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,040
this is exciting.
I'd like to do that too.

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,610
The one that I remember,
I wrote poems before this,

17
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:09,300
but the one that I consider the first
real poem was about that time too.

18
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,970
It was an Easter poem.
Um,

19
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,390
it's in school.
We were supposed to write,

20
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,950
write,
or paint or do something artistic for

21
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:22,140
Easter.
So I wrote this poem called the rabbit

22
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:25,500
with the droopy ear.
And I remember it because when I began

23
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:28,320
writing the poem,
I had no idea how it was going to end.

24
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,530
I just had this idea of a rabbit,
the Easter bunny,

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,520
who had one ear that you know,
drooped down and he was distressed.

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,700
So I kept writing and it rhymed and all
that.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,270
And it was actually the rhyme itself
that helped me solve the problem of a

28
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:46,620
rabbit with the droopy year.
So the end of the poem goes hip,

29
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:47,221
hip,
hurray,

30
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:50,790
let's toast the cup for now.
Both ears were hanging up.

31
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,720
He hanged himself from a tree and his
ears hang straight and everybody's

32
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:56,340
cheering.
And I was just,

33
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,100
I dunno,
it was very exciting to find that.

34
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:02,820
And I actually had to read it aloud in
class,

35
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,110
you know,
that was another thing.

36
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,050
Castles were the days when you did these
things in class.

37
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:11,240
But now people showed their paintings if
they had something from eastern.

38
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,370
I had to read my poem aloud them and
people liked it.

39
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:18,030
The kids liked my friends.
So that was an instant success story.

40
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,900
It hasn't totally changed.
It's changed in the sense that,

41
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,310
that it's to some extent,
I know,

42
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,150
let's say that the goal is not to come
to some kind of neat solution as that

43
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:38,950
did,
but um,

44
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,410
but it hasn't changed in the sense that
at some level I'm never quite sure how

45
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:51,341
the poem is going to resolve itself and
that I'm always in some way surprised.

46
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:57,320
I make a discovery in a poem once I
write it a buy.

47
00:02:57,321 --> 00:03:02,321
Now that means more accessing the
subconscious and the fact that if I

48
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:07,180
begin writing a poem on that means I'm
intrigued in some way by whatever it's

49
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:12,181
about and that if I'm not trying to find
something new and pushing that envelope

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,890
in the poem,
I can't expect my reader to be

51
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,600
particularly excited about it either.
