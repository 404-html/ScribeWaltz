1
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,780
Senator Wilford has to be one of my
biggest heroes.

2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,920
I'm Sargent Shriver,
and Senator Welford were the driving

3
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,720
force behind,
um,

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,370
and institution and more than that,
a grand idea,

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,460
the Peace Corps that inspired me in so
many of my generation to understand that

6
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:39,871
we could make meaningful contributions
through public service and that those

7
00:00:39,881 --> 00:00:43,930
contributions could have an impact on
the larger world.

8
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,970
I grew up as an Arab American already
feeling connected to a larger world,

9
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,660
the Peace Corps and so much of what has
grown out of it,

10
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,660
um,
gave me the ability,

11
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,990
it really motivated me and inspired me
in everything that I have sought to

12
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:04,240
achieve in my life since.
And uh,

13
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:09,241
as I have said on a number of occasions,
the ideals and the values and the,

14
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:12,960
the,
the,

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,960
the mission of the Peace Corps and of
the spirit behind it really is what

16
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:23,011
first drew King Hussein and myself
together as we found common ground,

17
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,380
having grown up in completely different
worlds.

18
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:31,381
We found common ground through this
concept of public service and joined our

19
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:36,520
lives together to carry on.
I feel that I am a Peace Corps volunteer

20
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:41,470
to this day and will continue to be and
consider every peace corps volunteer a

21
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:43,270
sister and a brother.
And,

22
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:43,690
um.
