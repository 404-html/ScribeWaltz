1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:05,080
Every technology I look at is now
entering this expedites will go.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,530
Ray Kurzweil says,
is any technology.

3
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:07,870
It becomes

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,210
the information.
It starts advancing exponentially.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,380
It seems that everything is being
digitized now and every technology I

6
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:18,280
look at seems to be entering this
exponential curve and what happens is

7
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:20,800
that when technology is advancing at an
exponential curves,

8
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:24,430
they're doing amazing things,
but when technologies converge,

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,760
when exponential technologies converge,
that's when you get industry

10
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,520
disruptions.
Behind everything is computing.

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,830
You know this device over here,
but my estimate is more powerful than 40

12
00:00:35,831 --> 00:00:39,060
cray super computers were.
Remember cray super computers that we

13
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,640
used to cost in the tens of millions of
dollars that had export controls on

14
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:44,620
them.
This is more powerful than those cray

15
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:48,010
super computers where there's something
in computing called Moore's law,

16
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,630
but Moore's law stipulates that the
processing power of computers doubles

17
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:55,780
every year or two.
It's actually the number of transistors,

18
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:59,500
but what in fact happens is that the
power increases,

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,740
the cost drops and this size become
smaller.

20
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,090
This exponential curve they're computing
is on means that faster computers can

21
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:10,030
design faster computers with faster
computers.

22
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,250
You can now design new types of sensors
with faster computers.

23
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,560
You can now build artificial
intelligence with faster computers.

24
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:20,410
You can now analyze data like wouldn't
even never analyze before.

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,880
When you have artificial intelligence
and sensors and robotics coming

26
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:26,930
together,
you get R,

27
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:27,230
two,
d,

28
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,570
Two from from star wars.
You get these humanoid robots that can

29
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:35,290
do what human beings can do.
You get the ability now to have robots

30
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:38,350
that can stock your shelves,
that can operate machinery,

31
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,850
that can be receptionists in your
offices,

32
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,820
so you have multiple technologies coming
together,

33
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:48,230
which,
which make it possible to do things I

34
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:50,950
could never be done before.
If you look at drones,

35
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,890
what are drones?
We had flying machines for a long time,

36
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,440
but these flying machines we used to
build these toys.

37
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,590
We built this toy.
Helicopters weren't stable when you

38
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:03,390
added a dreamer shifts to them when you
added computing to them and you added

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,950
deliberative artificial,
artificial intelligence to them so they

40
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:07,630
could keep track of all the data around
them.

41
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:12,930
You had the ability to have these drones
being stable and now ship goods,

42
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,460
so drones are advancing almost
exponentially and those drones are gonna

43
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,560
disrupt the entire logistics industry.
Imagine now being able to have your mail

44
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:25,510
being delivered to your mailbox using
drone.

45
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,330
Imagine having packages being delivered
by drone.

46
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,780
Imagine having us being delivered by
drone.

47
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,720
I'm not kidding.
Look at a hung and what they're doing in

48
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,840
Dubai.
That's really a drone on steroids that's

49
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,190
being used to transport human beings.
So every industry I look at,

50
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,210
I see as being ready for major
disruption.

51
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:48,790
Manufacturing is going to come back to
the United States.

52
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,350
In fact,
it is coming back to the United States

53
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:53,350
right now because of robots that can do
what human beings can do.

54
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,410
You have financial.
It's about way disrupted because you

55
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:58,720
have robot advisors,
you have digital,

56
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,070
you now have data which kind of stock
trades and so on.

57
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,990
All of these advances happening,
which I'm about to just help finance and

58
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,630
when you look at transportation,
you have electric cars which are

59
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,720
becoming cheaper and cheaper because of
the advances in battery technologies.

60
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,310
You have self driving technologies
because of the advances in ai imagined

61
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:22,060
self driving electric cars that cost
about 15 or $20,000 in the year,

62
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:22,894
20,
25.

63
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,670
What do you think has been happening to
GM,

64
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,710
Ford,
Toyota,

65
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:29,350
all of these companies will still need
one or two electric companies,

66
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:32,440
but more likely than not,
there'll be some upstarts from silicon

67
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:36,920
valley or from New Delhi or from Sao
Paulo that put the right technologies

68
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:39,690
together and that are inexpensive,
that started disrupting the entire

69
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,040
transportation industry.
As soon we're going to have virtual

70
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,230
reality that's going to disrupt
education itself.

71
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,030
Imagine being able to put glasses on and
watch me watch this in three dimensions

72
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,160
and converse with me.
Imagine me able to meet with people

73
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,720
interactively on the moon,
on are on Mars or in Tahiti.

74
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,820
That's going to disrupt the entire,
uh,

75
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,080
conferencing industry because we will be
able to have meetings in exotic places

76
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:06,910
and it'll feel like we're almost there,
right?

77
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,590
Education.
Imagine being able to learn science by,

78
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:13,990
um,
by doing virtual experiments,

79
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,750
anatomy,
by seeing your human body inside and

80
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:20,950
out.
Imagine learning mathematics by going

81
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:23,350
into ancient Egypt.
And building permits,

82
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,820
imagine learning Latin by going back in
time and,

83
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,120
and talking to people in Latin.
I mean this is all becoming possible and

84
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:33,400
this is within five years we'll have
that.

85
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,900
Imagine having digital tutors that,
that monitor your expressions.

86
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,190
Cameras can already do that.
And then monitor the child's interest in

87
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:42,850
learning.

88
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,820
If the child likes to play games,
it plays games with them.

89
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,930
The child likes to play to watch videos.
It takes them into three dimensional

90
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:52,150
holographic worlds and lets them
experience,

91
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,610
um,
and have experiences and learn on their

92
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:58,360
own is the child likes reading books.
It reads books to them.

93
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,730
So we're talking about disrupting
education itself.

94
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,430
Now granted that the,
uh,

95
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,450
the harvards,
the Carnegie Mellon's,

96
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:06,890
you know,
the elite universities have several

97
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,570
brand name was still value them,
but the world's masters will be able to

98
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:15,100
now get into holographic words and learn
in many new ways.

99
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,180
Every single industry where technology
can be applied is about to be disrupted

100
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:21,541
in,
in a,

101
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,374
in a big way.

102
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,990
Let's look at our own health.
What's happening now is that we become

103
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:34,510
data and no doctor,
they've got mixed software.

104
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,610
Let me explain,
we were fitbit's,

105
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,880
we were all these devices that monitor
body's functioning,

106
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,110
move forward five years and will have
sensors in our clothing.

107
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,660
Imagine that fruit of the loom tag in
your underwear,

108
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,670
which is monitoring you,
24 slash seven,

109
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,290
monitoring your activity levels,
which is monitoring your ekg is all

110
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,080
these different symptoms that can be
captured from the skin.

111
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Imagine it being gathered 24 slash seven
being uploaded to the cloud and having

112
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:03,080
an ai now analyzing the data and say,
look,

113
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,330
you're about to get sick.
You need to get some exercise,

114
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,830
and then having all of these cameras and
sensors which watch what we're eating,

115
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,570
what we're doing,
and saying,

116
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
alright Vivec,
you don't need that extra piece of Pie.

117
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,960
Stop,
abort,

118
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:15,794
abort,
abort.

119
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,820
This is all becoming possible in the
next five years or so,

120
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:21,560
we should be able to build these
technologies.

121
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,810
So we have digital doctors.
Now,

122
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,790
the second part of it,
genomics,

123
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,430
in the year 2000,
there was a race between the US

124
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,230
government and a scientist,
greg venter,

125
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,970
to sequence the human genome.
The government and affiliated lab spent

126
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,480
two point seven,
$5,000,000,000.

127
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,520
Venter came up with $100,000,000.
Don't ask cow,

128
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,390
but he took government data,
any sequence,

129
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:44,120
a human genome.
It made front page news worldwide.

130
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,370
For a long time.
Nothing happened.

131
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:48,890
We thought genomics was a waste of
money,

132
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,720
but over the last two or three years,
it's now gone at this exponential curve.

133
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,240
The study's been published very
frequently.

134
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:57,650
Now,
almost every week you're seeing

135
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,650
groundbreaking study is about the
discoveries,

136
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,870
discoveries in genomics,
the correlations between our health and

137
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:08,060
our genes,
but you know something.

138
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,440
What blows my mind the most is the
microbiome.

139
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,100
When you went to school,
your teacher,

140
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:19,610
your biology teacher taught you that
we've made up of cells and the cells

141
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:21,410
have a nucleus and that's where your DNA
is.

142
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,230
Do you know something?
What she taught you was wrong?

143
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,370
We made up of bacteria.
We have somewhere between two and 10

144
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,370
times more bacteria in our body than we
have cells.

145
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,750
The same technology which is sequenced.
They used to sequence the human body and

146
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:38,270
that's being used to sequence plants has
been sequenced.

147
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,650
It's been used to sequence the bacteria
in our gut and for the last few years

148
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,780
they had been measured breakthrough than
this.

149
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,210
Now I have a google alert on the word
microbiome.

150
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,780
Everyday I read new studies,
new breakthroughs happening with the

151
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:55,280
microbiome.
It seems that the DNA is important and

152
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:58,580
relevant,
but we may be looking under the wrong.

153
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,000
A lamp over here.
They also study which is showing that

154
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,000
it's what we eat and the,
uh,

155
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,450
this,
these trillions of bacteria that we have

156
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,080
in our,
in our body that there may be regulating

157
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:12,720
our health unit.

158
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,810
For example,
they will study.

159
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:18,800
There was a study published in nature
magazine about a year and a half ago in

160
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:19,760
we say took the,
uh,

161
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:22,550
the feces,
if I can say this on big thing.

162
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:27,551
Feces means shit to feces of a fat mouse
and gave it to 'em a 10 miles.

163
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:32,000
And the thin mouths gained weight.
They took the feces from a thin Muslin,

164
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:34,640
gave it to a fat mouse and the mouse
lost weight.

165
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,910
Now,
China is also replicated some of these

166
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,930
findings in human beings and they
determined that there's a correlation

167
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:46,370
between obesity and your microbiome,
so forget all these diets we've been

168
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:48,920
obsessed with.
Could it simply be a matter of taking

169
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,210
the feces of a thin person and giving it
to a fat person and a fat person loses

170
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:56,160
weight?
Let's watch this space over the next

171
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,860
five years.
We'll have scientific evidence of this

172
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,990
and also curing disease.

173
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,900
They've been studies to show the Crohn's
disease,

174
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,180
which is a debilitating disease that
children get.

175
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,400
They took the feces of a healthy child
and gave it to an unhealthy child and it

176
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:14,280
appears that the unhealthy child was
killed.

177
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,810
You're curing disease by transplanting
bacteria.

178
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:20,820
It doesn't make sense.
And then,

179
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:22,290
um,
antibiotics.

180
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,920
There have been several studies which
show that children who received

181
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:30,921
antibiotics than to be a base,
it may well be that antibiotics are

182
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:35,130
killing off entire species of bacteria
in our body and they're making us sick.

183
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,040
You know,
this is the crazy prediction.

184
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:38,874
And,
um,

185
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,820
but I really believe this is going to
happen that within 10 or 15 years we

186
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:47,310
look,
come to the conclusion that antibiotics

187
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,000
were destroying our health.
It may well be that we look at

188
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:54,900
antibiotics the same way we look at
those leeches that they use to suck out

189
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:57,080
blood from patients in,
in,

190
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,641
in,
uh,

191
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:58,474
in England.

192
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,880
And you know,
the belief was that you could kill

193
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,000
health by sucking our blood using
leeches.

194
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:06,390
Okay.
That may be what antibiotics are doing

195
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:10,170
to us.
Still emerging technology.

196
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,650
We don't know yet,
but when I read these studies every day,

197
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,430
that is a conclusion I'm getting to that
the entire Western medical system is

198
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:20,670
about to be up ended through the
microbiome.

199
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,320
So move forward to the 20 20th.
We have all of these diagnostic data.

200
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,850
We have all of these data about our
genome and our microbiome.

201
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:35,160
We have data on not thousands of people
but hundreds of millions of people.

202
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,820
And we have ai that analyzes all of the
information.

203
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,030
That app on your smartphone that's
monitoring you.

204
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:44,940
Twenty four slash seven may be the best
doctor you've ever had.

205
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,980
It's your friend.
It's your advisor,

206
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,260
it guides you on how to maintain optimal
health and it guides you on how to get

207
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:53,640
healed.
If you do get sick,

208
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,790
this is five slash 10 maximum 15 years
from now,

209
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:00,750
I think closer to the five to 10 year,
a beard that will have all these amazing

210
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:02,880
advances.
So this is exponential.

211
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:04,380
It's incredible.
It's amazing.

212
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,780
And,
um,

213
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,560
what the future holds in health.

214
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,210
If you look at artificial intelligence,
I know when I was young I was reading

215
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:21,211
about how ai would soon be able to
defeat the humans at playing chess and

216
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:22,420
everything else.
They will,

217
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:27,340
all these predictions made in the 19
sixties about how ai will become smarter

218
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:30,380
than men.
And then in the 1980 then in 1990

219
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:32,890
nineties,
we heard about Japan and the fifth

220
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:36,100
generation project,
we sort of thought that Japan would rule

221
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:39,100
the world and an ai.
And then what happened?

222
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,050
Nothing happened.
We basically had what was called the

223
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:45,130
new,
the Ai winter that,

224
00:11:45,131 --> 00:11:45,880
um,
uh,

225
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,910
there was a cloud cost over Ai.
We thought it was a hoax.

226
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:54,070
It was a fraudulent and ai was dead.
Isn't dead,

227
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,930
is everywhere.
Because here's,

228
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,430
here's what happened.
Scientists also started speculating on a

229
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:04,090
new method of doing ai.
The Ai that defeated Garry Kasparov,

230
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,790
big blue was really a decision tree.

231
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,090
It did,
if then l statements of every possible

232
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,940
chess move and with super fast
computers,

233
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,420
it was able to outsmart a human being
that's really simplifying the

234
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:19,300
technology,
but that's more or less the ai we had a

235
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:24,301
decade or 15 years ago and scientists
have speculated that maybe we could do a

236
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,550
different form of Ai.
We could mimic the human brain.

237
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,020
The human brain has layers of neurons
which you know,

238
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,380
and the connections between the neurons,
the program based on what's learned.

239
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,860
So a child sees a dog and mom says,
this is the doggy,

240
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,870
this is a cat and this and the neurons
adjust themselves to do associate that,

241
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,850
that image of,
you know,

242
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,110
an animal with the ears and a tail and
so on,

243
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,860
the shape with a dog.
So outbrain programs itself based on

244
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:56,860
what it learns.
So scientists speculated there were

245
00:12:56,861 --> 00:13:00,400
papers published study years about this,
that we could do ai using neural

246
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:01,234
networks.

247
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,230
Here's what the problem was to do neural
networks.

248
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:08,650
We needed massively parallel computers.
We didn't have those,

249
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,870
even the fastest supercomputers of their
time in the 1970,

250
00:13:12,871 --> 00:13:14,740
then the 19 eighties and even 19
nineties,

251
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,340
couldn't do massively parallel computing
about a decade ago and video and decided

252
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:26,260
to develop a chip to let children play
video games better.

253
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,970
The GPU,
the graphics processing unit and,

254
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,870
and uh,
they released it a few years ago.

255
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:35,950
It became a big success and then
scientists are looking at that Gpu and

256
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:38,440
realize that that's a massively parallel
computer.

257
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,830
Why can't we now do ai with it?
Started doing it and machine learning,

258
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,610
develop their many words over here,
but essentially we started mimicking the

259
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:50,560
human brain and using these,
these,

260
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,910
these GPS to learn the way human beings
do.

261
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,000
That's when you started having Elon Musk
and Stephen Hawking and a bunch of

262
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:00,670
others talking about artificial general
intelligence saying,

263
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:02,020
oh my God,
these things are going to be smarter

264
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:04,030
than us and all of these dangers.

265
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,050
The trouble was that that was the stuff
of science fiction and this was narrow

266
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:10,960
ai where you specifically taught a
computer what to learn.

267
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:14,290
You developed a model and then you throw
data at it and it learned from that.

268
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,970
So we assumed that you this age,
I was 20,

269
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:21,850
30 years away.
Here's what happened in the last couple

270
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,850
of weeks with a narrow,
narrow ai that a bunch of scientists

271
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:32,410
figured out how to defeat capture by
having the computer learn itself,

272
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,470
did experiments.
It really tried every combination,

273
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,010
figured it out.
And then Google was able to um,

274
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:43,530
to have alphago which is defeat these
goplayers at learned on its own.

275
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,130
So it seems like narrow ai is running on
its own now.

276
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:51,950
You can throw anything you want at it.
If you take that one step further and

277
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:52,470
you say,
okay,

278
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,390
I can learn anything that you wants to
learn and you'll begin to see out of

279
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:58,310
your general artificial general
intelligence,

280
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,310
the stuff out of science fiction
becoming possible.

281
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,810
So this is all happening a lot faster
than if anyone.

282
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,410
Anyone imagined.
I mean,

283
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:07,940
maybe there was some people who saw it
coming,

284
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:13,160
but the vast majority of experts in this
field didn't think that ai would

285
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:17,210
progress at the rate it's progress just
over the last few weeks and it could

286
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:22,160
well be that we get are today to a.
You Remember Star Wars Rosie from the

287
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:24,170
jetsons.
Samantha from her.

288
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,710
All of these things was found science
fiction that they starts showing up in

289
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:32,450
our apps and then in these bots we have
at home in the next seven to 10 years.

290
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,230
So I won't be surprised if I'm able to
order a rosy on Amazon.com in the year

291
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:40,280
20,
25,

292
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,490
20,
27 and she's droned over to my house and

293
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:48,491
Rosie costs about $10,000 because that
is how ai and robotics and whole bunch

294
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:51,620
of other technologies are advancing
exponentially.

295
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,040
Ever since the Internet came out,
we've started ordering things on the

296
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,250
Internet with the first one is some of
the,

297
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,990
some of the earliest websites were
these,

298
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:07,510
uh,
these websites is retailing websites

299
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:10,720
where you could buy oddities on the,
on the Internet.

300
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,050
And then we could buy clothing on the
Internet and then you can buy shoes on

301
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:16,570
the Internet,
and now Amazon has become a dominant

302
00:16:16,571 --> 00:16:20,260
player because practically everything
you need can be ordered on the Internet

303
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,960
and it comes to your house often within
an hour or so.

304
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,380
So that was retail disruption
one-on-one.

305
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,320
Now,
something even more dramatic is

306
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:33,280
happening that the retail store itself
is becoming digitized.

307
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,240
When you walk into your supermarket,
when you walk into any retail store,

308
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,160
you'll note that the camera's over
there,

309
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:45,420
you know the last two years or so,
the ability for computers to recognize

310
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:49,440
faces,
exceeded the ability of human beings to

311
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,680
do recognize faces.

312
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,940
So those cameras now had the ability to
know who you are.

313
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,960
And they have the ability now to just do
a interface with the registers where you

314
00:17:01,181 --> 00:17:03,760
buy things and to keep track of what are
you but your bought.

315
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,560
Give it five or 10 years and you'll be
walking up to the counters and you'll

316
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,230
have.
You'll have ads being served to you

317
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,110
based on your buying habits and based on
your interests.

318
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,310
So the entire retail experience begins
to change because you have customized

319
00:17:18,311 --> 00:17:21,250
coupons,
customized ads all being served 50

320
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:22,120
years.
You walk in there,

321
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,230
but then also the sensors I talked about
the cameras,

322
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,230
they can also detect inventory.
They can see what's on the shelf,

323
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:33,010
how much of it has been sold.
You don't until today we we've had human

324
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:36,580
beings going and doing an inventory
checks every two or three days ago and

325
00:17:36,581 --> 00:17:38,830
see what needs to be stacked and so on.

326
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,210
But with this cameras they can keep
track of what's on the shelves and they

327
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:47,620
can automatically order.
New replenishment is as needed and then

328
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:51,240
we'll have robots that can go and
replenish the shelves rather than human

329
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:53,200
beings going in and stalking.
You know,

330
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:56,160
I'll sell boxes.
Imagine you had robots that can do that

331
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,500
already.
The number of robotic technologies that

332
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:00,630
can.
They can go in and do this thing,

333
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:04,470
but give it five or seven years we'll
have robots replenishing shelves,

334
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,800
will have sensors and ai monitoring
inventory move forward a couple of

335
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,790
years.
Virtual reality is going to become much

336
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,230
more powerful.
Imagine wearing eyeglasses that dundalk

337
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,920
and take you into a holographic worlds.
Imagine now being able to meet people

338
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:23,070
where they want to and being able to
converse with them as if you were there.

339
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,050
Imagine not being able to go into a
store and now pick and choose what you

340
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:30,600
want from it.
Being able to examine the merchandise

341
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,281
and just say,
okay,

342
00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:34,380
I'll take it and imagine having a drone
over to your house.

343
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:44,200
Let me switch gears now and talk about
saving the world because I live in

344
00:18:44,201 --> 00:18:48,970
Silicon Valley and frankly I get
depressed at the fact that the tens of

345
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:51,790
billions of dollars being thrown at
mindless apps,

346
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,000
they would happen to.
There's some kid comes up with some new

347
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:00,070
stupid APP and he gets $100,
million in funding and other vcs give to

348
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:03,710
another hundred million dollars a
competitive it is.

349
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:09,220
We basically chasing rainbows in silicon
valley and not understanding the

350
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:12,310
problems of the world.
I was born in India.

351
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,700
I traveled the world and when I go
there,

352
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:17,470
I see poverty.
I see despair.

353
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,260
I see,
uh,

354
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,950
you know,
people living in ill health.

355
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,410
I see hunger,
I see disease,

356
00:19:23,411 --> 00:19:25,930
I see you know,
a majority.

357
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:31,100
I see people getting sick because of bad
water and it's depressing to see that we

358
00:19:31,101 --> 00:19:33,970
are living in silicon valley.
We're blessed living in New York City.

359
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:35,710
You're blessed because you have
everything you need.

360
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,110
We don't.
We know we see poverty and we ignore it,

361
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,780
but by and large,
we're not sensitive to the needs of the

362
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:43,270
world.
You travel to the developing world.

363
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:45,910
You see the dire poverty and the pain
and suffering,

364
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,200
but you know something I believed in the
next 10 or 15 years we can solve

365
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:52,510
virtually all of these problems that
are,

366
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,800
that are,
you know,

367
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,930
hurting people so much.
You know,

368
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,460
the,
the biggest volume is energy.

369
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,660
When people in remote parts of India,
Africa,

370
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,850
South America come home,
they can't study because they don't have

371
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:09,590
light.
This is something we can't comprehend in

372
00:20:09,591 --> 00:20:11,380
America that you don't have lights.
You can study.

373
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,500
Therefore children don't get education,
but this is a common problem in the

374
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:17,080
developing world.
80 eight percent of the infections

375
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:20,080
disease in the developing world is
caused by water borne viruses.

376
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,880
You know,
when you went to school,

377
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:24,280
you learned how to distilled water,
what do you do,

378
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:26,980
your body did you capture the
condensation and that is the distilled

379
00:20:26,981 --> 00:20:27,640
water.

380
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,570
Distilled water is 100 percent pure.
There's nothing living in it right now.

381
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,530
All it takes to have 100 percent clean
water to boil the oceans and have all

382
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:39,190
the water we need is energy.
The trouble is it energy has been so

383
00:20:39,191 --> 00:20:40,720
expensive.
Well,

384
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:42,520
guess what?
That's changing.

385
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:48,300
We're headed into an era of unlimited
clean and almost free energy.

386
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,870
Here's what's happening.
Solar Wind,

387
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:57,280
take solar as an example.
The cost of solar has dropped 99 percent

388
00:20:57,281 --> 00:21:00,910
since 1976.
And what happens is that as the price

389
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:03,520
drops,
the installations installations double

390
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:08,950
as the is double the price drops.
We're in a virtuous cycle of here of,

391
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,210
of exponential technology advances at
the pace we're going.

392
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:17,440
We're only about six doublings away from
having the capability of generating 100

393
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:20,140
percent of the earth's energy needs
through solar.

394
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,530
This sounds crazy,
and the dumplings are happening less

395
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:24,460
than every two years from now.

396
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,340
So what I'm saying is that by 20,
30 or so,

397
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,480
we could have unlimited clean energy on
this planet from sunlight and the cost

398
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,040
will be a fraction of what it is today.
Imagine one 16th of what it is today,

399
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,390
one 30th of what it is today in less
than 15 years from now.

400
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,000
This seems crazy.
That seems unimaginable,

401
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,700
but all you have to do is look at the
data and look at the trend.

402
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:53,680
It is as clear as can be now in America,
we regressing because you now have the

403
00:21:53,681 --> 00:21:55,840
US government.
And when I say US government,

404
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:58,540
I mean Donald Trump talking about
bringing coal back.

405
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,260
He's talking about stopping the progress
of solar energy because it disrupts us

406
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,030
unemployment.
This is complete nonsense.

407
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,510
Mean solar is generating more jobs than
coal ever had.

408
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,550
And uh,
this is good for America.

409
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:13,240
It's good for the world.

410
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,600
But regardless,
leave America site America is not

411
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,570
relevant anymore.
The really good news that we hear is

412
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,460
that America isn't leading the world
anymore.

413
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,960
It's China.
Number one.

414
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,280
They have committed to me,
I think 200 gigawatts in the next five

415
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:29,170
or seven years in India.
Number two,

416
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:31,120
they talk about 100 gigawatts.
We're talking about,

417
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,390
you know,
the two largest population countries in

418
00:22:34,391 --> 00:22:38,560
the world now leading the bath on solar
and even America decides to bring coal

419
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:41,310
back instead of coal fire plants.
It doesn't matter the world.

420
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:42,550
World War simple,
laugh at us.

421
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,960
The cost of solar will still still
advanced and the beauty of this is that

422
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,480
every village in the world will now have
light.

423
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:50,661
Now,
the,

424
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:51,410
the,
the,

425
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,760
the challenge over here is that you need
to store the energy because it doesn't.

426
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,830
The Sun doesn't shine and when it's not
sunny,

427
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,310
the wind doesn't blow and it's windy,
but the,

428
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,170
the good thing is that the cost of
storage is also dropping exponentially.

429
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,830
We should talk about three,
four or $500 a kilowatt hour for

430
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:09,130
storage.
Elon musk is hinting at $100 a kilowatt

431
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:13,630
hour the next three or four years and it
could go to $70 a kilowatt hour.

432
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,690
When you talk about prices such as that,
you're talking about self driving

433
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:19,990
electric cars called costing about 15,
$20,000.

434
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,960
Being able to drive 200 miles by the mid
20,

435
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:24,280
20 is 20,
25.

436
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:27,910
We could have cars that cost $1,500 and
go 100,

437
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:31,630
200 miles.
We're talking about now having enough

438
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:34,570
storage for village for a couple of
thousand dollars,

439
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,540
which means that you could have entire
villages,

440
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:42,550
entire towns all over the world which
are off the grid and have unlimited

441
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:46,550
clean energy,
so now we can have unlimited clean water

442
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:51,230
because we could just boil the oceans.
We can now have lights that children can

443
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:55,430
come home and study and we can educate
them because they'll also have

444
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:58,430
smartphones that provided them with
knowledge.

445
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:04,150
We can now have diagnostic devices which
provide them with information so that

446
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:07,190
they can get into the smartphone and get
health.

447
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,430
They can grow,
have vertical farms.

448
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:14,270
This is another amazing technology that
we don't talk very much about in the

449
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,610
United States,
but vertical farming is now advancing

450
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:20,210
exponentially because of two or three
different convergences.

451
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,860
First of all,
led lighting.

452
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:26,570
We don't have to understand that led
lighting now has become cost about the

453
00:24:26,571 --> 00:24:29,300
same as,
as these old bugs we had the edison

454
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:33,230
bulbs in the developing world.
They even cheaper and led lighting the,

455
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,170
there was a Nobel prize two years ago
for led lighting.

456
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:40,340
They've been such amazing breakthroughs
in led lighting so that you can now

457
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,030
fueling the,
um,

458
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:47,100
the frequencies to the growth of plants
so you can now have inexpensive energy

459
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,490
led lights and now you can also have
sensors and sensors,

460
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,760
cameras and other devices which monitor
crop growth,

461
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,890
which monitor the growth of every plant,
give them exactly the right nutrients,

462
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,370
glass houses.
We were talking about organic food.

463
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,710
We will be able to grow almost unlimited
food because of these advances in energy

464
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:12,440
led lighting,
ai and sensors.

465
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,740
That's in the next five or 10 years.
So we could literally have a planet

466
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:23,081
that's abundant in energy and food that
has perfect health in which we can three

467
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:28,640
d print our clothing.
All of these things are within reach

468
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,530
now that make get to the dark side of
all this.

469
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,640
And I talked about the advances in ai
and robotics and sensors,

470
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,820
industry disruptions,
despite what the optimists say,

471
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,460
despite what Silicon Valley says,
I don't see a scenario in which we'll

472
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,500
have enough jobs for human beings that
yes,

473
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:56,380
it will be new jobs graded zoomed by.
Don says,

474
00:25:56,381 --> 00:25:58,630
and God knows what.
That's a stupid example.

475
00:25:58,631 --> 00:26:02,290
Is that a tech mogul to throw up about
the new jobs that'll be created?

476
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,070
The fact is that these uber drivers,
these taxi drivers in New York City,

477
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,890
the even the uber drivers that we have
here now,

478
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,330
when the jobs get displaced,
they aren't going to be new jobs for

479
00:26:13,331 --> 00:26:14,920
them.
The truck drivers,

480
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,610
you're talking about 3 million truck
drivers in the United States when we

481
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:21,430
have self driving trucks,
which is very likely in the next five

482
00:26:21,431 --> 00:26:25,510
years or so.
Those Middle East truck drivers who

483
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:29,050
don't have other skills and driving are
not going to be able to learn how to

484
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:31,840
program robots or how to do Zumba
dancing.

485
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,490
Those truck drivers will be unemployed.
We're talking about people whose

486
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:40,450
livelihood depends on jobs.
Whose social stature depends on jobs.

487
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,610
I mean,
you know,

488
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:46,110
I think about it when we meet other
almost the first question we ask is what

489
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:50,100
do you do?
We're defined by our jobs and we take

490
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:54,630
pride in creativity and in our work and
our lives revolve around our work.

491
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:59,670
What happens when work disappears?
Even if you have all the energy you

492
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:00,960
want,
all the food you want,

493
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,930
you have perfect health,
you have all the things that you need.

494
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:07,020
You're able to three d print your,
your food and clothing and all that.

495
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:08,490
If you have all of those things taken
care of,

496
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,240
you have nothing to do.
You feel depressed.

497
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,430
What's the new social structure over
here?

498
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,730
What did we do with ourselves?
So silicon valley talks about universal

499
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:18,564
basic income.

500
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,260
That's their excuse for saying it's
someone else's problem.

501
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,650
It will be okay.
Let us get filthy rich and let someone

502
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:27,930
else worry about the problem.
We can just give money to everyone.

503
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,950
No people just don't want.
Many people want a purpose in life.

504
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,850
They want to be contributing to society.
They want to be doing good.

505
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,880
They wanted to be be earning their keep.
They don't want free money next,

506
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,460
you know,
10,

507
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,930
15 years.
I worry about him even as soon as five

508
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,390
years,
I worry about millions of people,

509
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,910
10 tens and millions of big people
becoming unemployed,

510
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:55,320
becoming depressed,
and I'm really rebelling that,

511
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,300
you know,
go back to the luddite movement.

512
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:00,840
So try to stop the progress of
technology because their livelihoods are

513
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,930
being taken away.
I worry about his dog scenario.

514
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:07,290
I worry about them wanting to burn down
the,

515
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:10,710
uh,
the tech companies and to stop progress

516
00:28:10,711 --> 00:28:12,660
at all costs because their jobs are
being taken away.

517
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,030
Strikes just like you've had strikes in
Paris,

518
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:18,450
you taxi drivers trying to burn down.
Uber's,

519
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:20,640
I'm exaggerating a little bit,
but it turned to stop Uber's.

520
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:24,750
You may have that in New York City.
You may have a people whose lives have

521
00:28:24,751 --> 00:28:28,590
been displaced.
You met people who have lost their

522
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:31,650
livelihood,
is now getting angrier and protesting.

523
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,490
Look what's happening in DC.
We have a government that's pandering to

524
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,130
the extremist groups to the anger,
right?

525
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:41,010
I mean,
it was unimaginable even two years ago

526
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:46,340
that we will be accusing the White House
of being Nazi sympathizers mean.

527
00:28:46,771 --> 00:28:50,250
This is craziness.
I mean the allegations are not founded,

528
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:54,000
but the fact that we can even make those
allegations shows that something is

529
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:55,460
wrong over here,
that,

530
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:56,490
um,
the,

531
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,170
the,
the,

532
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:02,170
the gap between the haves and the have
nots has grown not only in money which

533
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:05,280
is always talk about before,
but also in knowledge,

534
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,890
in culture,
in values.

535
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,490
We're technical people who are watching
this or technology literate that you get

536
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:14,550
your information online,
you watch videos such as this and you

537
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:17,340
stay up to date with this.
The people in Middle America,

538
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,500
the truck drivers,
the taxi drivers,

539
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,430
many of them don't watch this and
they're not up to date.

540
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:28,670
We're doing nothing to mitigate the gap.
There are policymakers are talking about

541
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,370
taking things away,
taking healthcare away from people,

542
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:36,190
taking benefits away from people.
They're not talking about how do we now

543
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,770
uplift all of mankind.
They,

544
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,190
they think we have limited resources and
we have to ration them,

545
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,030
but they don't seem to realize that we
heard it edited to an era of abundance

546
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,900
in which we can now distribute the
perspective of grading and uplift all of

547
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:50,734
mankind.

548
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,300
In my book,
the driver and the driver of scar.

549
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:03,990
I tried to look at technology through
three lenses and the purpose of this was

550
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,780
to figure out how we can create the
amazing future star trek versus the

551
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:14,290
darkness of Mad Max.
The three lenses are,

552
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:17,050
number one,
does the technology have the potential

553
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:20,410
to benefit everyone equally?
Can we make sure that everyone gets good

554
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:22,540
healthcare from it?
Can we make sure that everyone gets

555
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:25,060
clean energy from it?
Can we make sure that everyone benefits

556
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:28,060
from the technology so that we don't
have people being left out and we don't

557
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:31,780
have anger brewing and then go back to
movies such as war of the worlds.

558
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:36,280
Go back to a lot of these science
fiction horror movies in these movies.

559
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,970
The rich had access to better technology
that they had health,

560
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:43,390
they had all sorts of good things that
pull had nothing.

561
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:47,020
They were working in the mines.
The outcome was always the same in all

562
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:52,021
of these movies that the war ended up
killing the rich madmax that the anger

563
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:58,290
started brewing and rebellion started
and the focus was to destroy the

564
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:00,220
technology to do,
do,

565
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,780
to kill the rich.
Basically,

566
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:03,820
this is what happens in all of these
dark movies.

567
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,420
If we don't know,
start educating and uplifting everyone

568
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,420
within had mad max.
The second lens is,

569
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,080
do the rewards outweigh the risks?
Is this technology going to benefit us

570
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,630
or is it going to hurt us?
We have to look at every technology to

571
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:18,970
make sure that the rewards outweigh the
risks.

572
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,010
For example,
gene editing Crispr,

573
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,680
we now have the ability to alter life
itself.

574
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,300
In about a decade from now,
we will have the ability to select the,

575
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:29,134
the,
uh,

576
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,450
um,
the feature that our children have.

577
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,440
This sounds crazy,
but we may be able to take pills that

578
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:40,470
alter the genome of an embryo and give
them new characteristics due to remove

579
00:31:41,861 --> 00:31:43,990
disease and to give them maybe extra Iq.

580
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,500
This is all becoming possible.
Another question that if you do that,

581
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,460
do not create the um,
uh,

582
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,000
the world of Gatica,
that movie Gattica in which you had,

583
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,170
you know,
people who have enhanced and then you

584
00:31:56,171 --> 00:31:58,700
had people who want enhanced and the
people that were unanswered.

585
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,000
It's basically based on society and
guess what,

586
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,230
the people who want enhanced rebelled or
we now creating super human beings.

587
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:09,490
Are we not creating killer viruses?
I will now creating massive joblessness

588
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:12,120
and we're now creating all of these new
nightmares with technologies.

589
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:16,570
Do the rewards truly outweigh the risks?
And then the question is,

590
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,330
does the technology great autonomy or
dependence?

591
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,370
I mean,
I'm a big fan of self driving cars.

592
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:26,380
I drive a tesla model s and I can't wait
to get into auto drive when I get on the

593
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:29,020
highway because I want the car to drive
itself.

594
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,050
Now eventually when I say eventually,
probably 10,

595
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:35,130
15 years from now,
we're going to be deciding that we don't

596
00:32:35,131 --> 00:32:39,950
want these dangerous human beings on the
road is human beings get distracted.

597
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,990
They text while they're driving,
they get angry,

598
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:43,930
they get road rage.
The Russian,

599
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,850
the traffic at the same time,
they crash into each other.

600
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,820
They're dangerous.
We don't want these dangerous animals on

601
00:32:49,821 --> 00:32:51,050
our roads.
Instead,

602
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:55,880
we want to have smart ai and robots
doing the driving,

603
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,160
so we made it through the human beings
off the road,

604
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,380
which means that we've lost autonomy,
right?

605
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,310
We get angry.
Gone are the tilt of driving,

606
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,120
so on the one hand,
self driving cars give us autonomy.

607
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,010
Why autonomy?
Because everyone now can get familiar

608
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,850
anyway.
They wanted to be where they want to be

609
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,820
safely.
Mothers can send their children to

610
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:18,680
school knowing that they will safely
arrived there,

611
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,710
the that blind to people who are
handicapped.

612
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,610
The old don't have to worry about having
to drive anymore.

613
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,320
We have autonomy like we've never had
before because it's not driving cars,

614
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,760
but then we lose another autonomy.
That autonomy is the right of being able

615
00:33:34,761 --> 00:33:38,270
to drive on highways.
So you have a trade off over here.

616
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,160
The question is,
does it lead to.

617
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,320
Does technology to independence or
autonomy?

618
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,950
In the case of self driving cars,
it's both dependents and autonomy at the

619
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:48,320
same time,
but we've got to figure this out.

620
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:50,600
We've got to figure out what the
tradeoffs are.

621
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,220
So what I posit in driver in the
driverless car is that we have to look

622
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:58,210
at each technology technology through
this.

623
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,400
These three lenses,
and what I believe,

624
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:04,250
but I sincerely believe is that if we
get these right,

625
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,720
that if we now benefit everyone and we
do things in a sensible way,

626
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,880
we can create the amazing future of Star
Trek that we really can get to this

627
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,570
world in which we're now sharing
prosperity.

628
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,410
We're seeking enlightenment and others
were working to uplift humanity.

629
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,990
And we can do this 300 years old
schedule.
