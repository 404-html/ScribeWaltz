1
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,440
The one that jumps out at me as frown,
frown,

2
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,640
checking Valerie Piper,
Germany in the 70s.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,640
He play in the NASL for the cosmos.
I think he played for the cosmos.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,561
You know,
I don't know.

5
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:17,850
I should know my history better than
that,

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,713
but,
uh,

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,030
he's just an amazing player.
He's very graceful.

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,520
Uh,
his decision making was always,

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,740
you know,
very clever and,

10
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:26,790
um,
you know,

11
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,270
and the way he led was,
I,

12
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,360
you know,
I can't say say behind the scenes,

13
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:33,600
but just in terms of on the field,
he's always projected a cool and

14
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:37,050
calmness and this composure that I
thought permeated through the rest of

15
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:38,280
the team.
And I think that's,

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,770
uh,
something that I try to emulate in some

17
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:42,480
regard.
Uh,

18
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,130
you know,
when things are getting tough and things

19
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:46,230
are hard,
I may try to just try to find that

20
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:47,890
balance of trying to bring it back the
other way.

21
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:50,640
And,
and if guys I don't think are doing

22
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:51,720
enough,
then you know,

23
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,390
I can be that guy too.
And I think that's been the hardest

24
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:57,120
thing for me because that goes against
my grain is being this other guy.

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,920
Uh,
I have in me,

26
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:01,260
but I never really bring out that much
because I just,

27
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,540
that's not really the guy I choose to
be.

28
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:09,180
Yeah.
