00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,600
Moving into a completely new era of 
history,

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,473
and I describe it in two ways,
it's the end of the era of western 

3
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:18,774
domination of world history,
but I hasten to add it's not the end of 

4
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:23,214
the West.
The West will remain single strongest 

5
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:28,830
civilization for long,
long time to come,

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,683
but it can no longer dominate the world 
and the way it has for the last 200 

7
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:36,450
years and the second aspect of this new 
era.

8
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:37,284
Of course it's the return of Asia and 
while the return of Asia seems rather 

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,360
abnormal.
Now actually if you look at not the last

10
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:48,060
200 years,
but look at the last 2000 years,

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,500
the two largest economies of the world 
have consistently been China and India.

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,520
So if China and India become,
once again the Rogers economies,

13
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:58,590
as everyone predicts in the 21st 
century,

14
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,280
it will clearly be returned to know and 
so we shouldn't be surprised.

15
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,133
It's going to happen.
