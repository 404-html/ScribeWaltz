1
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,570
So Oscar,
you asked the question,

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,200
what are some of the easiest ways that
you can prove that the earth is round?

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,450
Because apparently this is something
that we're debating.

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,260
I have no idea why.
That's a hard thing for me to even start

5
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:26,430
talking about because there are so many
proofs that the earth is round.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,470
It's difficult to know where to start
and it's not okay to think that the

7
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:34,290
earth is flat.
This is not a viable argument.

8
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,480
Um,
I have friends who have been on the

9
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:39,270
international space station.
They have orbited the earth once every

10
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:40,830
90 minutes.
You know,

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,490
I have had personal experience with
people that have been up in space and

12
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:47,490
can see with their own eyes that the
earth is round.

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,370
And of course we've taken all of these
amazing pictures from space that they're

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,220
so beautiful,
all those pictures of the earth.

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,930
So I don't really know what's going on
right now with this earth is flat thing.

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,460
But I will tell you that this is one of
the things I really enjoyed teaching my

17
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:06,570
own astronomy class about because there
are proofs all around you.

18
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,510
It is not difficult to know that the
earth is round.

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,110
In fact,
people have known this for way more than

20
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:16,200
2000 years.
The ancient Greeks actually had a number

21
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,320
of really elegant,
wonderful proofs that the earth was a

22
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:21,780
sphere.
So let's start from the simple to the

23
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,020
slightly more complicated.
One of the things you can see yourself

24
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:29,940
with a pair of binoculars is if you
actually go out to a lake and there are

25
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:33,780
boats on that lake.
The farther way of boat is,

26
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,560
the more the bottom of the boat will
disappear and you'll basically just see

27
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:41,130
the master of the boat and as a boat
goes farther and farther away,

28
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:45,360
the last thing you will see is the very
top of the master of that boat.

29
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,830
And that's because the boat is actually
going over the horizon that's curved.

30
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,010
And that means that as it goes farther
and farther away,

31
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,430
you see less and less of the bottom of
it and more of the top of that.

32
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,280
You can see that with binoculars,
by an ocean,

33
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,780
by lake,
it's really easy.

34
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,510
That wouldn't happen if the earth were
flat.

35
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,960
You would simply see the boat getting
smaller and smaller and smaller as it

36
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,870
went farther away,
but you'd be able to see the whole thing

37
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,220
with the same proportions.
Now another way that you can tell that

38
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:19,221
we're on a sphere is to think about how
there's something called the tropics on

39
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:24,210
the earth and the tropics are replaces
near the equator of the earth where

40
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,370
sometimes the sun is overhead in the
sky.

41
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,700
And this was actually something that the
Greeks used,

42
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,170
not only to prove that the earth was
round about 2000 years ago,

43
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,100
but they actually measured the
circumference of the earth accurate to

44
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:39,600
within just a couple of percent.

45
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,630
2000 years ago,
we've known that the earth was round.

46
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,980
There was a really brilliant Greek
scientists called Air Stoss,

47
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,410
denise and Aristotle,
and he's noticed that there was a town

48
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:52,230
called [inaudible],
and on a certain date,

49
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,520
the sun would actually shine straight
down to the bottom of a well.

50
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,160
That meant the sun was directly
overhead.

51
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,170
You could look down a well and see the
sun shining back at you and on the very

52
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,390
same date,
farther away in the city of Alexandria,

53
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,570
that didn't happen.
The son was not directly overhead,

54
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:15,190
it was a slight angle and all the air
stoss and he's did was he measured the

55
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:20,191
difference in the angle of the sun.
It was straight overhead and sign in

56
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:23,350
Alexandria,
it was a little bit less than overhead

57
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,840
and he rationed that that change in
angle from one city to another was

58
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:32,050
probably indicative of us being on a
curved surface.

59
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,260
And you could make all kinds of
measurements even between those two

60
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:37,600
cities and see that the angles were
different.

61
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:40,960
The Sun was at a different place in the
sky using this.

62
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:45,010
He actually measured the circumference
of the earth and he got it right 2000

63
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:47,920
years ago.
So another really simple proof is that

64
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,180
on any given date at different cities
and different places around the world,

65
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,040
the sun is at different angles in the
sky.

66
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,740
That wouldn't happen if the earth wasn't
around.

67
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,440
Then there's some other proofs that are
a little more obscure,

68
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:03,370
but they're actually really lovely and
one is to observe what happens during a

69
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:07,630
lunar eclipse.
Now a lunar eclipse happens when the

70
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,830
Earth casts a shadow on the moon.
The moon actually goes dark.

71
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:12,880
In fact,
if you've seen one,

72
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,540
you could actually see the earth's
shadow go across the moon and when the

73
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,620
moon is entirely in the Earth Shadow,
the moon looks kind of dark and even

74
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,550
kind of red colored.

75
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,760
It's really,
really beautiful.

76
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,150
What's happening in that case is that
the sun is on one side of the earth are

77
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,400
this in the middle and it's casting.
A shadow of the earth is casting a

78
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:34,390
shadow on the moon and as the shadow
moves across the moon,

79
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,270
you'll notice that the shadow is curved.
It's round.

80
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,320
So something like the sun that's bigger
than the earth and is able to cast a

81
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:44,410
shadow of the earth on the moon can
actually show you the shape of the

82
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:45,460
earth.
A high,

83
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:47,770
you might say,
but could the earth be a disc?

84
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,560
Could it be flat?
But it's actually still shaped like a

85
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:51,940
disc,
not like a sphere.

86
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,380
There was a Greek scientists called air
starkist and what he noticed was that

87
00:04:56,381 --> 00:05:00,070
you can get a lunar eclipse at many
different angles where the sun is.

88
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,070
Sometimes the shadow goes straight
across the moon.

89
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,190
Sometimes it just kind of glances the
moon just a little bit as in shadow,

90
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:10,510
just on the top or on the bottom from
every different vantage point,

91
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:13,390
every different angle of the sun is
casting a shadow.

92
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,390
You always get a perfectly curved
shadow.

93
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,990
The only shape that can cast a shadow
that's curved from any direction you put

94
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:26,440
the light is a sphere.
So people have known that the earth is

95
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:31,441
spherical for thousands of years.
It's not okay to say that the earth is

96
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:34,450
flat.
This is some sort of strange denial.

97
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:37,810
I don't know where it comes from and
it's something where I keep getting this

98
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:40,420
question.
We really need to put this question to

99
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:43,360
bed because we've known the earth as a
sphere for a long time.

100
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,020
They there,
there's some even well meaning people

101
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,630
that have kind of,
you know,

102
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,061
they say,
well,

103
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:50,830
I don't really believe the earth is
flat,

104
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:52,630
but I'm not really sure what to think
about it.

105
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,060
And they've asked me some interesting
questions like,

106
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:56,260
um,
um,

107
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,500
you know,
they've heard that the,

108
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:58,940
uh,
that space is very hot.

109
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,661
You know,
that when you,

110
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:03,860
when you go up above the atmosphere,
the temperature spaces millions of

111
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,693
degrees,
which is true.

112
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,481
Uh,
the,

113
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:08,480
the,
the problem is there's basically no air

114
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:09,291
at all.
So I mean,

115
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,120
I mean the,
the gas right around the earth is

116
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,160
actually millions of degrees hot.
That's actually true.

117
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,140
But there's almost no,
none of it.

118
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,830
There's almost nothing like one single
Proton whizzes by you at a temperature

119
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:22,130
of a million degrees.
It's not the same as temperature like

120
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,001
in,
in the air.

121
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:27,180
It's not the same thing at all.
So that one was a one that I get some

122
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:28,550
times.
And the other one is,

123
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:31,610
I'm actually said this to somebody I
couldn't believe they'd never thought of

124
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:32,600
it.
That,

125
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,800
you know,
with binoculars,

126
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:36,170
you can see planets,
you can see Saturn and Jupiter.

127
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:36,921
You can,
as you can see,

128
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:38,670
Mars with a telescope,
the sun,

129
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:40,730
the moon,
everything else you see in solar system

130
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:43,730
is a sphere.
So we're,

131
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:46,910
we're the one thing that is different,
you know?

132
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:47,661
And,
and that actually,

133
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:50,510
that actually made somebody who was,
it was more interested in actually

134
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,190
hearing information that she got them to
think.

135
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:53,150
They're like,
you're right.

136
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,120
You know,
you know,

137
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,150
everything else we take a picture of as
a sphere.

138
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,850
Hmm.
Yeah.
