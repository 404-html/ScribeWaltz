1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,253
Okay,

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,780
is,
is a lousy,

3
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:13,411
but,
uh,

4
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:15,540
you know,
I'm old enough to have lived through a

5
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:20,040
few business cycles so I'm not
particularly perturbed about it by it.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,690
And um,
you know,

7
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:25,920
I would say that I'm a change creates
opportunity.

8
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:29,460
So from an entrepreneur's perspective,
this isn't a good time or bad time,

9
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:32,010
it's just the time.
It's the time like any other time and

10
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:33,990
any other time,
uh,

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,140
there's always opportunities.
Now the opportunity has to fit with the,

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,031
the,
the,

13
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:40,830
uh,
the current economic context.

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,950
Uh,
but I don't think the fact that the,

15
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:45,120
uh,
economies,

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,020
uh,
uh,

17
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,550
at a slow period and,
and,

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,040
and maybe so for awhile,
there shouldn't be anything.

19
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,003
The turtle

20
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,993
for sure.

21
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,230
Well,
uh,

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,080
you know,
I think just so many stupid things that

23
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,040
are currently going on,
there's a few things that would be

24
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:12,041
really helpful for small business.
I'm a huge and unmanageable costs for

25
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:17,450
small businesses,
healthcare and the cost to the

26
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:20,630
individual entrepreneur.
If you leave a corporate job and start

27
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:22,010
your own business,
even just to do,

28
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:24,920
to take care of yourself and your family
is a huge,

29
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:26,930
huge expense,
that's a problem.

30
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:30,880
That's not just for small businesses is
a national problem that we have a,

31
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,550
that the issue of healthcare that really
needs to be addressed and there's got to

32
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:39,530
be affordable healthcare for a to allow
people who work in small business to

33
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:44,120
have the coverage that they need.
And I would extend that to thinking

34
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:47,540
about all sorts of other employee
benefits and pensions and so on,

35
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:52,070
a great obstacle for small businesses to
be able to attract people out of

36
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:54,950
corporate jobs if they have to give up
some of those,

37
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,780
some of those perks of pensions and so
on.

38
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,910
Um,
uh,

39
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,320
so healthcare is one big issue at this.
The second big issue.

40
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:06,540
And uh,
we're now dealing with a gasoline that

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,140
at unheard of prices,
uh,

42
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,550
and um,
uh,

43
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,580
which is adding a real burden for lots
of folks just getting back and forth to

44
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:19,220
work.
But it's changing the nature of our

45
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:20,570
economy.
Uh,

46
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,580
this is potentially a good thing if a,
this can be signaled in some,

47
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:30,581
through some policy way to suggest that
we are going to for once take seriously

48
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:36,230
the idea of reducing our dependence on
oil and the venture community is just

49
00:02:36,231 --> 00:02:41,231
chomping at the bit a to be able to
address some of these issues of

50
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:43,220
renewable energy.
Uh,

51
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:46,490
the problem is that as oil prices have
gone up and down,

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,470
a previous investments didn't pan out
because the oil price goes up and the

53
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,380
price comes down and all of a sudden the
cost of these old alternative

54
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:55,820
technologies,
uh,

55
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:57,740
is too expensive.
So,

56
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,940
uh,
I think,

57
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,970
uh,
uh,

58
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,210
something that could really be a great
boost to the economy is,

59
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,480
is a serious,
I'm serious policy,

60
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,220
a initiative to address the healthcare
costs and a serious policy issue,

61
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,750
uh,
to,

62
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,110
uh,
allow entrepreneurs to address the issue

63
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:22,111
of renewable energies.
And that will just bring so much a new

64
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:25,150
talent and ideas into the marketplace.
