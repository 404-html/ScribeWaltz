1
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:10,860
So

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,360
Stephanie,
you ask a great question,

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,170
how likely is it that we're going to
find life on a planet outside the Earth

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,870
in your lifetime,
say in the next 40 or 50 years?

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,570
And of course this is something that
nobody can answer.

6
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:22,830
Exactly.
We don't know.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,000
That's,
that's the answer,

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,070
but I think it's very likely indeed.
Now when I say life,

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,930
there's a lot of ways you can take that
word.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,640
You know,
I'm not really talking about

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,520
civilizations or spaceships or things
like that.

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,640
I think it's much more likely that we're
going to find microbes,

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,280
simple life.
But to me that would be really,

14
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:43,890
really exciting.
There are several places in our own

15
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:47,790
solar system right now that we think
might be good environments for life,

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,060
and as I said before,
we haven't found proof of life yet,

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,880
but we've found some very,
very interesting things.

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,470
For example,
on Mars,

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,500
Mars has an atmosphere.
It's much thinner than the earth's,

20
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:01,080
but it's still there.
We think there might even be water

21
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:04,530
underneath the surface of Mars.
And recently we've detected organic

22
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:08,430
molecules which are sort of the building
blocks of our chemistry on Mars as well.

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,660
It's possible that the surface of Mars
itself is not a very good place for

24
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:15,660
life,
but maybe underneath meters under the

25
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:20,400
soil in the rock you could find bacteria
and there are a lot of analogs to this

26
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:21,870
on earth.
Similar things on earth,

27
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,500
we find bacteria that can exist as a
mild under the earth.

28
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:28,620
We find these things in gold mines very,
very deep under the earth.

29
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,430
You break open the rocks and there's
actually bacteria living in the rocks

30
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,390
very far down into the earth and there
are other places in the outer solar

31
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:38,790
system that we think are great
environments for life too.

32
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,920
There are moons of Jupiter and Saturn
that we know have liquid water oceans.

33
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,800
For example,
Europa is a moon of Jupiter and we know

34
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:49,830
that your rope,
it has vast reservoirs of liquid water

35
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,860
that are protected by a shell of ice.
In fact,

36
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:56,160
this one moon of Jupiter,
Europa actually has far more liquid

37
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:59,190
water on it than earth does.
And there are some suggestions that

38
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:00,990
there might be interesting chemistry as
well.

39
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,740
There's also a moon of Saturn called
enceladus and the same thing applies.

40
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,270
There's a liquid water ocean under ice
and in the case of enceladus you

41
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:13,200
actually have cracks in the ice that the
water is flying out of and turning into

42
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:16,800
ice crystals.
We actually flew our Cassini spacecraft

43
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:20,790
through these jets coming out of
enceladus and we detected organic

44
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,580
molecules.
So we know that there is warm salt

45
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:25,410
water,
there's interesting chemistry.

46
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,420
It's a great place to go looking for
life.

47
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,790
And there's another moon of Saturn to
called Titan,

48
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,460
which is very different from that and
has an atmosphere.

49
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,890
We actually think that there are lakes
of methane,

50
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,020
not water,
but actually liquid methane on the

51
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:39,420
surface.
And below that there's probably liquid

52
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:42,780
water underneath.
So you have liquid water,

53
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:44,850
you have organics,
you have an atmosphere.

54
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,700
Maybe that'd be a great place to go
looking for some microbes.

55
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,610
So some people say that's not very
exciting.

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,890
You know,
we're not going to find aliens in the

57
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:56,610
sense of spaceships and you know,
cling ons and any science fiction you

58
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:57,870
want.
I,

59
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:00,730
for one though,
I'm going to be very excited when we

60
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:03,010
find any evidence of life outside the
earth.

61
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,400
I actually have a bottle of champagne
chilling because I think it could happen

62
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:10,150
almost any day when some of our rovers
or some of our satellites around other

63
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:12,160
planets come back with really
interesting data.

64
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,060
Think about the questions we can answer.
Does life,

65
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,570
even if it's at a bacteria level of,
even if it's just a tiny little bit of

66
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:21,220
life,
does it have DNA?

67
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,190
Is it similar to us?
Is it different from us?

68
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,550
We finally have the next example of how
life can form and how life can evolve

69
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,710
and our view of the universe will never
be the same again.

70
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,370
And my bet is that's going to happen in
the next 50 years.
