1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
I think that this particular
problem with Brian Williams is part of a

2
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:13,140
larger phenomenon in television news.
It's become increasingly under siege

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,360
from so many alternatives,
first with Cable News,

4
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:17,640
alternatives,
and then with the Internet and mobile.

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,730
Uh,
and that's put enormous pressure on

6
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:24,000
these organizations.
Unfortunately in my view,

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,510
uh,
the organizations have responded by

8
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:32,370
taking their anchors and the reporters
and making them the story far too often.

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,290
Uh,
it's understandable.

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,050
It's a marketing decision.
It's a branding decision,

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,550
but it's not fundamentally what I
believe journalists should be doing.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,040
Uh,
I spent years working with Peter

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,040
Jennings and Peter believed firmly and
we all embraced the notion that in the

14
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,310
end we're not the story.
We're reporting the story.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,830
And as soon as the journalist becomes
the story,

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,340
you're in trouble.
You have pr staffs and marketing staffs

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,040
who are coaxing,
who are urging,

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,160
who are reinforcing any story that makes
their reporter or their anchor appear

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,010
larger than life.

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,150
I don't know.
When we decided that reporters have to

21
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:15,570
be war heroes,
reporters don't fight wars,

22
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,060
they report on worse.
And that,

23
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:20,640
as I say,
is not unique to Brian and that is not

24
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:23,790
unique to NBC News.
And therefore I am concerned about some

25
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,850
of the other news organizations who are
so quick to judge.

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,100
I can't predict what will happen to
Brian Williams.

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,780
In fact,
I don't think there's anyone who can

28
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:33,840
predict that right now because I'm not
sure anyone knows what all the facts

29
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:35,610
are.
The starting point is to find out what

30
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:37,350
the facts are.
Um,

31
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,250
what I do anticipate based on what I've
heard so far,

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,170
is that a NBC news will need to find a
way.

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,370
And I don't know what that way is.
I wouldn't dare try to tell them what

34
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:53,460
the way it is,
but I think they need to find a way to

35
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:54,720
send two messages.

36
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,930
And this is the hard part is you have to
send both messages provided Brian comes

37
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:02,400
through this.
And based on what I know right now,

38
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:05,880
I would expect him to.
You have to reinforce that you still

39
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:08,300
believe in him,
that you still value him,

40
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,740
that you value all of his years of
service,

41
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:13,140
service,
and the wonderful journalism he's done

42
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,540
through the years,
number one,

43
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,960
and number two,
no one is above the truth.

44
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,870
This is the number one priority for any
news organization is to have their

45
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:27,570
credibility and their trustworthiness
and their relationship with the

46
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:30,480
audience,
and therefore they have to find some way

47
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,590
of planting a very big flag saying,
we believe in Brian,

48
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,800
but we really take this terribly
seriously.

49
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,650
This is more important than anything
else we do.
