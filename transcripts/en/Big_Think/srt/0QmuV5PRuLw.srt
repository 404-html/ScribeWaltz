1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,233
Scott schuman,
the sartorialist what made me want to 

2
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:12,864
work in fashion when I was growing up,
I played sports like all the regular 

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,953
kids in the Midwest,
boys in the Midwest and a would read 

4
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:24,540
sports illustrated and you know,
read all that,

5
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,660
all the athletes that I liked and kept 
reading that,

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,940
what they were spending their money on 
cars and music and fashion.

7
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:36,260
And so I'd start picking up those 
magazines and like,

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,103
um,
I ended up becoming more interested in 

9
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:40,330
fashion than I did sports,
you know,

10
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,740
and the better I addressed the more 
attention they seem to get from women,

11
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:47,040
which was more attention than what I was
getting on the football field.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,180
Blogging part was pretty easy.
You know,

13
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,703
I had an idea for the Sartorialist,
this idea of mixing photographs of guys 

14
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:59,620
that I knew were stylish with guys that 
I knew were fashionable,

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,750
which are two different things.
Um,

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,793
but I only really knew about websites at
that time and I knew that a website 

17
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:06,334
would take too much time,
too many other people would have to be 

18
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:09,760
involved.
And,

19
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:10,594
uh,
when I happened to be going through the 

20
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:13,204
Internet,
I found a blog just happened to click 

21
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:20,200
onto a blog and I'm the kind of person 
that once I see something interesting,

22
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:21,034
I just started hitting all the buttons 
trying to figure out how they're doing 

23
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,374
it.
And it was an interior design blog 

24
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:26,530
actually.
And uh,

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,480
I thought it was pretty cool.
She had like 30 comments,

26
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:29,314
you know,
she had some good visuals up and once I 

27
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:35,080
saw that I was able to look at it in an 
abstract enough way to be able to say,

28
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,360
you know,
I could do this with my photographs,

29
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,223
you know,
that once I figured out how she was 

30
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:42,430
doing it and how simple it was to do,
I thought,

31
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:45,010
you know,
that's the format I want to do.

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,230
You know,
there weren't really any,

33
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:48,064
um,
kind of definitely I don't think any 

34
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:53,500
street style blogs maybe face hunter was
right about that time.

35
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,030
But I didn't really know it in the 
beginning.

36
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,300
But I saw the potential of using,
you know,

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,153
a blog as a,
as a visual format as opposed to with 

38
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,843
just text driven.
At least I think most of the blogs at 

39
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:07,540
that time were very text driven.
If they had a little bit of visual,

40
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,690
it wasn't very important where for me I 
thought,

41
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:11,524
you know,
this would be a great way to put 

42
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:12,724
photographs up and then,
and then put a little bit of text to 

43
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:16,920
create a conversation.
But I'm,

44
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,630
the simplicity is what made the blogging
part.

45
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:22,690
So the simplicity and the interaction 
with the audience,

46
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,390
with the two things I think made it most
attractive.

47
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,140
The difference between what's designers 
create or,

48
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,063
you know,
they're creating a little world every 

49
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:34,790
season,
you know,

50
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,020
head to toe a full look,
you know,

51
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,440
a head shoes,
bags,

52
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,710
dresses,
the whole thing more street fashion is,

53
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,120
you know,
what people were really wearing.

54
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:45,380
You know,
there's an element of new,

55
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:48,710
there's an element of previous seasons.
There's um,

56
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,300
your own history,
you know,

57
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:54,020
your sweatshirt from highschool and a 
vintage pieces.

58
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:54,854
And you know,
it's that kind of combination that I 

59
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:59,980
find so much more interesting than just 
the runway.

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,731
Right.
You know,

61
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:02,950
and I love fashion.
I love going to the runway shows.

62
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,530
It's not so much,
um,

63
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,433
for me a shopping trip is,
it is the appreciation of the craft of 

64
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:09,040
these,
you know,

65
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,020
um,
design geniuses,

66
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:11,963
you know,
who come up with beautiful color 

67
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:16,300
combinations and beautiful proportion,
um,

68
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,550
suggestions and these kinds of ideas.
Right.

69
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,620
I look at the runway shows in a very 
different way.

70
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,050
Just kind of a,
I'm a romantic,

71
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,903
uh,
artistic interpretation of how they 

72
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:25,774
would like to see fashion going forward.
But for me it's much more abstract of 

73
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:32,530
runways shows are much more abstract 
than,

74
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,200
you know,
what ends up on people as much more real

75
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:36,034
to me.

76
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,130
Uh,
oh.

77
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,840
Realistically a fashion insider.
I mean,

78
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,200
I was in the business 15 years before I 
started the blog,

79
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,360
so,
you know,

80
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,310
even though it was in a different part 
of the business,

81
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,144
it was in sales and marketing.
Now the people that I've met since I've 

82
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:55,780
been doing the blog did I know really 
beforehand,

83
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,160
but I knew about the business,
you know,

84
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:00,220
and I,
that's how I really came up with the.

85
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:00,841
I,
you know,

86
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,250
I think part of what I do is the 
photography.

87
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,870
I think that's half of it.
And like I'm able to,

88
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,320
I learned how to be able to shoot 
something in the romantic way that I see

89
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:09,760
it.
Um,

90
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,670
but then the other half of it is the 
editing,

91
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,583
you know,
who I choose to shoot and not so much 

92
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:17,434
because of the drama and over 
overdramatic nature of the way they're 

93
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:21,550
dressed.

94
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,170
Sometimes it's very,
very subtle,

95
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,153
you know,
my background and tailoring and pattern 

96
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:29,120
making and pattern making.
And uh,

97
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,800
I think really helped me understand,
you know,

98
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:32,490
the subtleties of a suits,
you know,

99
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:35,200
and why a guy can look great looking 
very subtle in a suit.

100
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,170
And I think that's what really separates
me is um,

101
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,773
you know,
I have a real understanding of actual 

102
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,710
clothes and how they work and how they 
should fit and you know,

103
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:50,010
a reasonably good artistic version of 
photography that kind of captures that.

104
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:50,990
And I think,
um,

105
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,490
that was really the kind of the best 
combination,

106
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,400
a different screen fashion and style is 
a fashion is,

107
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,900
is the,
sometimes,

108
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,883
you know,
it's the thing that's happening at that 

109
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:04,480
moment.
You know,

110
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,330
sometimes it might be point issue,
sometimes it might be heels,

111
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,523
sometimes it might be flats,
where style I think is something that's 

112
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,930
always there in your own personal 
wardrobe,

113
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:16,770
whether it's a Navy Cardigan,
uh,

114
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,640
reading glasses like this.

115
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,220
Um,
but that's different for everybody.

116
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,233
You know,
everybody's version of style is totally 

117
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:24,304
different and you know,
that's what I think keeps me going out 

118
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:26,824
on the street every day is going out and
kind of seeing the variations and what 

119
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:34,180
things maybe I had never seen in quite 
that way that I find very curious in how

120
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:35,230
people will,
um,

121
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,920
be able to communicate their own persona
through their clothing,

122
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,860
their posture,
the way they wear their hair.

123
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,510
Uh,
you know,

124
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,373
I think all those elements end up 
becoming very interesting because I 

125
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:49,540
don't think I'm really particularly a 
people person.

126
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,000
Um,
so for me,

127
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:55,330
I think it's interesting to kind of be 
able to read people in that way.

128
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,533
Uh,
my favorite cities to shoot a Milan in 

129
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,580
Italy obviously.
Uh,

130
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,040
the guys look great.
The women look great.

131
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,830
There's an old school romance.
I mean,

132
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:12,800
it feels like Italy in the 19 fifties,
you know,

133
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:13,634
the guys at the,
at the bar still were beautiful white 

134
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:18,460
dinner jackets and uh,
you know,

135
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,850
there's a formality there.
I mean,

136
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:22,280
it doesn't matter if it's 90 degrees in 
the summer,

137
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,470
uh,
and it's,

138
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,303
you know,
killer hot and in Milan and the guy 

139
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,953
still put on their jackets to leave 
their office to go get lunch and bring 

140
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,810
it back to the office.
You'd never see that in America.

141
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,930
Guys barely can put on their,
you know,

142
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:37,360
their shirts to go to the office or,
you know,

143
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,440
keep their tie done.
Um,

144
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,790
so I think there's a romance,
you know,

145
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,624
that they're willing to um,
and enjoy that formality that they've 

146
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:46,280
created.

147
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,390
They're in Milan and,
you know,

148
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:49,250
all across Italy,
but especially in Milan.

149
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,340
So I love that formality.
But at the same time,

150
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,233
after about a week that I've had enough 
of that and I'm ready to go to Paris 

151
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:58,960
where it's more sexy and more,
um,

152
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,170
a more dramatic,
more challenge,

153
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,004
you know,
in terms of how they put things 

154
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:04,960
together.
Uh,

155
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,973
and then back to America.
I really love being able to go to those 

156
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,600
three different places and you know,
in America were so much more sporty,

157
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:13,880
so much more color,
so much more,

158
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,830
so much more difference in the way that 
we talk about our style and way we exude

159
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:25,270
our style.
We have in,

160
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,470
like in Milan for instance,
for example,

161
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,300
they're very narrow,
you know,

162
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:30,134
they,
everybody dresses in a few certain ways 

163
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:35,900
and they have beautiful variations on 
those few kind of styles.

164
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,050
But in America there's million different
styles,

165
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,360
know rocker and vintage and sporty and 
preppy.

166
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,213
And so I like that variation.
So one without the other is not nearly 

167
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:46,184
as interesting.

168
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,693
I've been to Hong Kong,
which I thought was very interested in 

169
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,320
Beijing.
Um,

170
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,213
but I wanted to go there more and 2010 
and that's one of my big challenges is 

171
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,170
try and make it through Asia more.
And I don't know.

172
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,950
I'm curious to see what I find you.
I think,

173
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,740
uh,
in Japan I think,

174
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,363
you know,
there's a lot of style and love 

175
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,930
subcultures,
but uh,

176
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,210
it'll be interesting to see how much of 
them,

177
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,553
how much of the people wearing those 
clothes are really expressing something 

178
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,420
about who they are or who they want to 
be.

179
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,900
And it will be very interesting to see 
once,

180
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,520
especially once you get there,
once you get to a certain city,

181
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:29,354
like in Stockholm,
you really get to know the people a 

182
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,260
little bit and what they're saying 
through their clothes.

183
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,070
You want some more.
To me,

184
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:37,170
I think it's much more interesting than 
just the clothes they're wearing or the,

185
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,540
the length of the skirt.

186
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,900
You start to understand something about 
that culture,

187
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,860
you know,
in Rio,

188
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,690
none of the girls have short hair.
A lot of the interviews I did in Rio,

189
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:48,260
people say,
what do you want to find in Rio?

190
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,890
And say the one girl with short hair 
because they just don't do it.

191
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,690
And once you get to know them a little 
bit,

192
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:54,524
you realize that all the girls are 
afraid to cut their hair short because 

193
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,500
they're afraid they're men won't like 
them.

194
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,903
So what you think of is a beautiful 
natural style actually becomes a style 

195
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:08,970
out of fear and it kinda changes your 
perception of it a little bit.

196
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,670
So I'm a or for,
I'm Japan,

197
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:12,504
I'm very curious to see who is really 
doing something unique and who's just 

198
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:15,534
doing something because they've heard 
that's the way they do it in Florence 

199
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:18,764
and Milan.

200
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,440
Well,
by that question,

201
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,840
that's a,
what's that an oxymoron?

202
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,093
Trend in classic.
I don't know if we can put those two 

203
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:29,160
together.
Um,

204
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,400
I don't know because it's totally 
different for everybody.

205
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,091
You know,
for me,

206
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:34,740
uh,
a Navy Cardigan,

207
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,180
you know,
always looks great.

208
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,060
Um,
converse tennis shoes,

209
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,520
you know,
just always worked.

210
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:42,390
But that's for me.
Um,

211
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,360
and that's just,
at least for me,

212
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,893
I don't ever really look for trends.
I'm looking for just what captures my 

213
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:50,334
attention at that time.
And rarely do I ever look back and try 

214
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:55,960
and put together trends or say,
you know,

215
00:09:55,961 --> 00:10:00,870
this kind of trend is important for me.
It's about the individual expression.

216
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,990
And if you go back and look through the,
uh,

217
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,400
through the archives,
you know,

218
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:07,260
you might find certain things become 
trends,

219
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:09,270
but it's just not something that 
particularly interests me.

220
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,470
Blog took off pretty quickly.
And,

221
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:17,304
uh,
I think it's because I had a particular 

222
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:18,960
point of view,
you know,

223
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:21,300
there's been other street style 
photographers,

224
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:22,950
Bill Cunningham and the New York Times,
you know,

225
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:23,784
it was like the godfather of modern 
street style photography and other 

226
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:29,370
people historically.
But I think what,

227
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,340
what they had always done was they were 
always trying to,

228
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,353
to find the most dramatic,
the people that you wouldn't see every 

229
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:38,280
day.
The people that were really different,

230
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,763
uh,
where I shot things that people would 

231
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:42,804
aspire to,
something that maybe they would see 

232
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:45,174
every day but didn't really know the 
difference between something done well 

233
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:48,294
and something not done as well as suit 
that fits a guy really well as opposed 

234
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:53,710
to just another suit or dress the,
oh,

235
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:55,320
that,
that fits a woman beautifully.

236
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,180
Or the way that she's put this 
combination of,

237
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,410
you know,
uh,

238
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,850
for an open toe shoe.

239
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,370
You know,
two totally separate kind of ideas.

240
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,170
And yet she's put them together in a way
and you go,

241
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:04,591
oh,
okay,

242
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:06,490
that does look really great.
Um,

243
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,150
so I think it took off now because I was
shooting the incredibly different.

244
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:09,984
But because I was shooting something 
people could relate to a lot of 

245
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:14,910
different people could relate to.
And uh,

246
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,390
I don't think there was one time,
one particular thing that made me say,

247
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:20,130
you know,
this is really becoming popular.

248
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,330
But for me it was,
um,

249
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,533
you know,
these really heartfelt emails that we 

250
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:27,000
get from people that,
uh,

251
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,613
you know,
that meant something to them that they 

252
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:31,920
could look at these pictures and say,
you know,

253
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:34,680
I look like that guy,
but I don't look like him yet,

254
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,390
you know,
I want to look like him.

255
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,551
I'm big like,
Hey,

256
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:38,384
I'm a little chubby like him,
but he looks great and he's dressed 

257
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:43,170
better in his clothes than I am.

258
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,220
So I know these guys were printing these
photographs up and taken it to Nordstrom

259
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:49,920
or saks or dillard's or wherever and 
saying,

260
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:53,860
help me look like this and would be able
to achieve it because it was never in my

261
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:56,200
blog.
About how expensive it is,

262
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,270
you know,
I'm almost,

263
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,210
if you look at most of the guys that are
really well dressed,

264
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,110
it's just the attention to detail and 
anybody can do that,

265
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:05,944
you know,
that just taking it to alterations in 

266
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:07,564
getting the right amount of cuff and all
these little things that aren't about 

267
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,760
the expense but just not the attention 
to detail.

268
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,683
I think uh,
economic situation is affected in the 

269
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:20,231
sense that,
you know,

270
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:21,064
a lot of people that have money always 
have money and they're still buying and 

271
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:25,324
they're still shopping.
They're just not talking about it when 

272
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:28,570
we go to,
when I go to fashion week,

273
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,933
you know,
people are still wearing new things and 

274
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:31,684
they're still shopping.
But I think they feel a little more 

275
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,000
guilty when they've had to left five 
people go from the company and not bring

276
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:39,160
to people that usually go to Europe,
to Europe.

277
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,353
So they're still shopping,
they're just not talking about it that 

278
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:43,260
much.
Um,

279
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,040
but it's also,
I think,

280
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,840
helped people find a romance in shopping
in their own closet.

281
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:50,674
Again,
you know,

282
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,570
going back and looking at the clothes 
they already have.

283
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:56,200
Because we've become so such consumers,
they think people kind of forget,

284
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,183
you know,
what,

285
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,413
what humongous closets we have full,
more close than what they could ever 

286
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:03,250
wear.
So like maybe,

287
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,900
you know,
open people's eyes again,

288
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:05,734
it's really looking at what they have 
and kind of re engineering it and 

289
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,780
reworking it.
And I think that's good.

290
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,520
No,
it was in the business for 15 years.

291
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:16,354
My ex wife was a designer.
I had to show room where I worked with 

292
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:19,564
young designers,
so I was very familiar with what 

293
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,763
designers look for when they're going 
out to look for inspiration and they're 

294
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:27,760
not looking for trends,
you know,

295
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:30,550
if it's something that's already out on 
the street now that's a trend now.

296
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:33,610
It's not going to be something they're 
going to design for a year from now.

297
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,810
It's usually much more abstract.
And it might be a detail,

298
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:38,644
it might be color combination.
It could be even the way that the 

299
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:44,110
posture of a girl,
you know,

300
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:49,111
I think one of the things that a lot of 
designers look at my site is a,

301
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,630
not specifically the pieces that I'm 
shooting,

302
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,490
but I think they may be looking at a 
girl and think,

303
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,001
ah,
you know,

304
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:59,200
I love the way that girl looks and,
but I would never dress like that,

305
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,790
you know,
that girl inspires me.

306
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:01,960
But,
uh,

307
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,793
I love the idea of a long dress.
Maybe she was wearing a long dress and 

308
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:05,220
they're thinking,
oh,

309
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,053
you know,
it's been a long time since I've 

310
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,013
designed a long dress,
but I would never put it in a floral 

311
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:11,980
print.
I would do it this way.

312
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,250
So I don't think they're looking at my 
site for specific inspiration.

313
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:20,290
Like they're looking at an abstract way 
to get them thinking about that customer

314
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,573
and that girl and that kind of girl that
would like to dress and how they would 

315
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,410
do it a little bit differently.
And,

316
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:27,244
uh,
so I think that's probably the most 

317
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:30,160
realistic.
Or even the guys,

318
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,230
you know,
I know a lot of the designers take a lot

319
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:33,064
of those old guy pictures.
I take these kind of really stylish old 

320
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:39,370
guys and I know it's not because of the 
specifics clothes that they're wearing,

321
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,533
but it's the posture and it's the 
attitude and it's the elegance of these 

322
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:47,410
guys that is attracting them,
that inspires them.

323
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,500
And it's the same thing for me.
You know,

324
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,950
I'm totally inspired.
It's not that I want to dress like an 80

325
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:54,320
year old Milanesa guy,
but,

326
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,163
uh,
the fact that they can still carry 

327
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:58,740
themselves with such a,
um,

328
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,860
such,
uh,

329
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,693
an elegance even at that age I think is 
very inspiring and whether it's Milan 

330
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,530
or,
or Harlem or wherever,

331
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,263
I think that's something that guys 
really key on a lot of the designers 

332
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:13,650
key.
And on a,

333
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,660
when I'm shooting,
I try and keep it just very easy,

334
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:20,720
very unplanned.
You know,

335
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:23,300
I'm just walking around on the street 
looking for somebody that uh,

336
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,673
um,
I think it looks cool and then it might 

337
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,210
be able to get a good shot.

338
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,973
Today I was at Jamba juice and uh,
it was a very cool girl and I'm very 

339
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:36,590
cool,
a young college girl and you know,

340
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:40,940
she had great coat and a little again 
with a port trim and another print dress

341
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:41,774
and you know,
nothing that she was wearing was 

342
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,273
expensive.
It was all kind of thrown together but 

343
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:45,890
don't together just right,
you know,

344
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:48,320
the color combination.
How cute she looked.

345
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:50,840
She was very kind of charming.
Even though she was a tall girl,

346
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:55,010
she had a very kind of small persona,
very kind of shy persona.

347
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,290
And all of that's important.
I mean,

348
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,090
to me,
the persona that she's creating,

349
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,940
whether it's a big dramatic one or quiet
shy one,

350
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,193
I'm the way they stand.
All of that is something that you want 

351
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:06,644
to try and capture in some way.
At least my perception of who that 

352
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:11,720
person is in the photograph.
And uh,

353
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,610
so that's,
you know,

354
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:14,990
you never know where you're going to 
meet these people.

355
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:15,890
That's why it's fun,
you know,

356
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,850
that's why I enjoy going out and getting
lost,

357
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,223
you know,
hopefully every day or every other day 

358
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,180
and just seeing what's out there because
by the end of the day I usually get back

359
00:16:26,181 --> 00:16:27,080
to my office and think,
Oh,

360
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,330
I never would've thought I'd run into 
that kind of person.

361
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:31,820
They are doing that thing.
And uh,

362
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,803
by constantly challenging myself,
that's why I think keeps the integrity 

363
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,240
and the sincerity of the blog.

364
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,500
Now.
I haven't had too many people.

365
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,334
I mean people turn me down,
but I think I've gotten pretty good at 

366
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:47,360
being able to tell who will probably 
turned me down,

367
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,853
you know,
and being able to read people a little 

368
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:50,061
bit,
you know,

369
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:52,440
if someone's walking really fast and it 
looks like they probably have some where

370
00:16:52,441 --> 00:16:53,274
they're going.
So don't get too many people that are 

371
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:57,250
upset.
Um,

372
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,753
I did have someone who was in the 
background of one of my pictures that I 

373
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:04,670
put up like two weeks ago and it totally
unrelated,

374
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,020
just happened to be walking by on the 
street,

375
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:09,440
but he just happened to be looking just 
at the right moment at the subject I was

376
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:10,274
taking a picture of.
And so email me today a feeling that 

377
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:16,480
maybe he should be compensated for being
in that picture and,

378
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,353
and,
and,

379
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,763
uh,
or at least a big print or something 

380
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:21,710
like that.
So I thought that was a little bit odd.

381
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,600
Um,
but,

382
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:24,770
uh,
lot too many,

383
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,293
too many weird or bad stories.
I haven't been beaten up or chased or 

384
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:29,684
anything yet.

385
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,870
A Guy Ron story,
a dot for,

386
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,390
uh,
not just because she's my girlfriend,

387
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:42,770
but I do truly think that she's got the 
best women's fashion blog in the world.

388
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,320
Um,
her point of view is great.

389
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,101
You know,
she's,

390
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:47,570
um,
her writing is great,

391
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,650
photography is Great.
Her,

392
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,493
um,
the way that she communicates to her 

393
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:56,040
reader is brilliant.
The way she writes and the ability to be

394
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:00,420
that stylish and that fashionable and 
yet that approachable.

395
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,240
Uh,
it's a real challenge,

396
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:04,074
you know,
to be able to do that and do it 

397
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:07,320
consistently every day because you can't
fake it.

398
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:10,140
She's doing a lot of things that other 
blogs just aren't doing,

399
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,490
you know,
graphically.

400
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,070
Um,
that make it really interesting.

401
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:14,904
I mean,
my blogs doing very well at my audience 

402
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:17,724
is bigger than hers,
but there are days when I look at her 

403
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:20,244
blog and I'm totally jealous,
totally pissed that she hasn't told me 

404
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,600
how she did some of those things that,
you know,

405
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:28,540
just little technical things to make a 
shots look great or you know,

406
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,420
how she's laying them out on the page or
whatever.

407
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,240
So,
I mean,

408
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,960
it's a good kind of challenging 
relationship,

409
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:36,810
but I think she probably does better 
than anybody else right now.

410
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,290
And I hate her for that.
I don't know,

411
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,100
I guess,
uh,

412
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,933
with magazines,
I've never really looked at them that 

413
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:46,524
way,
you know,

414
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,540
being someone who,
you know,

415
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,060
I'm a self taught photographer and I 
taught myself photography,

416
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,950
just looking,
looking,

417
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:54,360
looking at the magazines.
So,

418
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:55,410
to be honest,
a lot of them,

419
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,520
you know,
I hardly ever read,

420
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,910
you don't really look at their,
what their real fashion opinion is.

421
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,240
Um,
for me it's always been very abstract,

422
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,313
you know,
so,

423
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,120
um,
I don't know,

424
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:08,700
I can't really,
I love my fashion magazines,

425
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:09,960
you know,
a lot of times I get a question,

426
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:10,794
you know,
do you think blogs will replace fashion 

427
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:13,194
magazines?
And I hope not because I love my Gq and 

428
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,823
vogue in Paris vogue and all of that.
Like I look at them less now just 

429
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:20,784
because I've started to develop my own 
photographic style that I'm very 

430
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:25,560
comfortable with.
But uh,

431
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,993
uh,
they really are the ones that taught me 

432
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,380
a,
the idea of how I wanted to shoot.

433
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,570
Well,
and it almost everyone in Hollywood,

434
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,420
uh,
almost everyone in the record business.

435
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,610
Um,
I don't know,

436
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,790
you know,
to be honest,

437
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:48,420
I think it's funny.
I don't really know.

438
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,320
I'm not much of a,
you know,

439
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,390
I maybe said this before,
I'm not much of a people person,

440
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,060
you know,
in doing my blog.

441
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,170
It's one of the few places where being 
incredibly selfish,

442
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,780
it's actually very positive.
Um,

443
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,290
because I'm not really,
when I'm taking a picture of someone,

444
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,970
like I don't really put their names 
down,

445
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,630
rarely do I put the people's names down 
because it's just not that important,

446
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,190
you know,
I'm taking a picture of someone.

447
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,413
It's my perception of who they are.
I'm taking it by the way I'm taking it 

448
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:17,580
because it's some I want to be able to 
look at.

449
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:18,414
I want to enjoy the picture.
So it's my selfishness that's actually 

450
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:22,670
very generous in the sense that,
you know,

451
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,543
I share the picture,
I'm trying to take a nice picture of 

452
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:25,584
them,
but I'm doing it for totally selfish 

453
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:27,084
reasons.

454
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,103
And one of the things I think people 
misunderstand on the blog is just 

455
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:33,390
because I take a picture of someone,
it doesn't mean they have great personal

456
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:34,201
style.
I mean,

457
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:36,420
I don't know these people,
most of them I've never met before.

458
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,310
Um,
you know,

459
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:41,070
maybe there's just one thing and the 
look that I really love and that's all I

460
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:46,071
want to focus on and I try and shoot it 
in a way that highlights that.

461
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,543
But,
uh,

462
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,893
you know,
I don't really have a lot of people and 

463
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:51,744
I'm just not judgmental that way and I 
think that sincerity comes through in 

464
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:54,761
the blog.
I mean,

465
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:56,230
to me it really doesn't matter who they 
are.

466
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,333
It's not that I don't want to shoot 
people in Hollywood or models or 

467
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,030
musicians,
uh,

468
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,930
if I ran into 20 musicians in a row,
then I'll look great,

469
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,420
I'd shoot them.
But that just rarely ever happens.

470
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:10,780
I don't really fall into that.
But,

471
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:11,680
uh,
it's for me,

472
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:13,570
it's much,
much more abstract.

473
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,381
Yeah.
I think,

474
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:18,214
uh,
Tony Randall on the odd couple always 

475
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:22,510
looked great.
I always thought he looked really cool.

476
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,180
I don't think Jay fashion's really 
changed much in the last five years.

477
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:29,440
I mean,
the system is the system,

478
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,713
um,
if it was really going to change in a 

479
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:34,870
major way,
now would have been the time to do it.

480
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,460
You know,
so many companies are closing,

481
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,910
but they're not really changing their 
method of how they do it.

482
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:43,510
They're jumping on the new hot thing,
whatever it is right now.

483
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:44,890
It's blogs,
you know,

484
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:47,230
who knows what's gonna,
be next holograms or whatever.

485
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,563
Um,
and I think a lot of companies are 

486
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:51,040
closing,
which is great.

487
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,890
I think we're way too oversaturated,
too many brands,

488
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:56,530
too many stores,
too many labels.

489
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,170
Um,
so,

490
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,063
you know,
if it was going to change now would be 

491
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:03,010
the time to do it.
But it's not really changing that much.

492
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,180
Shipping's not changing,
you know,

493
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,230
I'd love to see a,
a time when,

494
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,423
you know,
when it actually gets cold is when 

495
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,830
winter clothes hit the store,
you know,

496
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,693
as opposed to the winter clothes hit the
store always on the hottest day in 

497
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:17,680
August is when all the winter clothes 
hit.

498
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,203
So I think um,
because of technology and because of 

499
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:25,630
this kind of speed of digital,
uh,

500
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,870
digital internet and everything,
uh,

501
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,690
it will change soon because smart 
designers,

502
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:35,320
young designers are going to be able to 
start showing their collection in a much

503
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:40,321
wider audience and ship those products 
closer to the real time.

504
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:43,090
They won't need vogue and all these 
other places.

505
00:22:43,091 --> 00:22:47,230
They have to work so far in advance to 
promote their fashion because they'll be

506
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:48,064
able to do it right.
You know themselves through the 

507
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,890
Internet,
right to their audience.

508
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,870
And be able to,
um,

509
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,273
uh,
ship the close accordingly to that 

510
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:56,590
audience.

511
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,390
You know,
I think there's very,

512
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,233
a day very soon where you'll be able to 
get some kind of digital printout of 

513
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:05,330
your body and have the clothes made for 
your shape.

514
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,920
There'll be a new age of tailoring and 
um,

515
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,993
you know,
it's definitely more than five years 

516
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:11,434
off,
but I don't think it's a really far 

517
00:23:12,461 --> 00:23:13,294
away.
You know,

518
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,283
I think it's definitely in the near 
future and that will really change 

519
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,910
fashion,
the fashion system,

520
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,680
uh,
in the sense that,

521
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:21,620
uh,
you know,

522
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,613
you won't just have all this excess of 
clothes and things shift so early 

523
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:27,280
because you need x amount of time to 
sell.

524
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,930
Hopefully it'll become much more 
efficient,

525
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:29,764
much more effective if you're actually 
making clothes that fit people in 

526
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,733
clothes that people are ordering and 
want as opposed to trying to guess what 

527
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:40,621
they might want my readers or are 
located a everywhere.

528
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,653
You know,
one of the things that I knew about 

529
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,583
doing a photo driven blog was that you 
didn't have to read English to be able 

530
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:49,880
to enjoy the photographs.
You know,

531
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:54,370
there were elements of people that are 
looking at it for the fashion content.

532
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,563
There is an element of people that kind 
of like to live vicariously through all 

533
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,430
these different crazy places.
I'm going,

534
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,150
there's an element that likes to share 
their fashion idea.

535
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,761
Maybe,
you know,

536
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:05,594
they had always dreamed of becoming a 
fashion designer and moving to New York 

537
00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:11,150
or Milan,
but for whatever reason,

538
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:13,730
a family reason or whatever,
they weren't able to do that.

539
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,520
So they're stuck in Wisconsin or 
wherever they are.

540
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,690
And this is their chance to kind of be 
in that community a little bit,

541
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:22,490
share their comments,
look at fashion,

542
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,970
share it with an,
with an audience.

543
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:25,843
One of the things we're very proud of is
we've been able to create an audience 

544
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:29,480
that's respectful that,
you know,

545
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:31,250
you can talk about your fashion ideas,
what you like,

546
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:32,940
what you don't like in a respectful for 
them.

547
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,750
Um,
so with that said,

548
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:37,520
I think it's a,
it's all over the place.

549
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:38,354
I mean,
all I know is right now when I travel 

550
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:41,780
and I do these book tours,
know we always get a really,

551
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:43,310
really good turnout.
And a very,

552
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,690
a very varied audience,
you know,

553
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,730
men,
women,

554
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,750
young,
old,

555
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,070
rich,
poor.

556
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,920
I'm the audience.
Very much looks like,

557
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,390
uh,
like the,

558
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,310
uh,
photographs of my blog photographs in my

559
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:57,110
book,
which is something I'm very proud of.

560
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,990
New York has changed,
changed a lot,

561
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,730
you know,
I've been here almost 20 years.

562
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,480
And uh,
maybe when I first moved here,

563
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:10,670
people have said I'd be a horrible place
to raise kids.

564
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:14,040
And now I think everyone would agree 
it's pretty good place to raise kids.

565
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,750
It's clean.
It's a,

566
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,070
a modern.
I mean,

567
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:24,080
I travel around a lot and um,
I still think New York looks great,

568
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,190
you know what I mean?
All the time.

569
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,540
There's new buildings going up,
new.

570
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:29,440
It's different kinds of architecture.
Um,

571
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,283
there's just always something happening.
So I hate to sound like such a Yankees 

572
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,770
Fan.
That's such a New York fan.

573
00:25:33,771 --> 00:25:34,604
But,
uh,

574
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,270
I still can't think of anywhere else I'd
rather live than here.

575
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,310
Shoot from the heart.
That's a good one.

576
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,910
I think that actually just stopped at 
that shoot from the heart.

577
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:47,744
I think,
um,

578
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,040
would be the best year I think.
Um,

579
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,240
it really doesn't matter,
you know,

580
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:54,074
I like to take good quality photographs.
I'd like to try and have the light a 

581
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:58,040
certain way and the person's standards 
certainly,

582
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,230
even though it's all very natural,
it happens very quickly.

583
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,600
I worked very quickly and work with what
I'm given.

584
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,873
Um,
I don't really pose the people or 

585
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:05,984
anything.
I just kind of worked with who I think 

586
00:26:07,431 --> 00:26:08,264
that person is.
But what I think I'm the honesty of it 

587
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:16,010
is I think people like to live 
vicariously.

588
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,840
I mean it's the whole idea of this 
reality TV.

589
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:18,674
They like to live vicariously through 
other people and see other people's 

590
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:23,840
ideas and other people's take on the 
world.

591
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,860
So whether you're taking it with just a 
little digital camera,

592
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,053
if you're actually taking pictures that 
mean something to you in a real way and 

593
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:36,770
you actually have something to say,
people will follow that blog,

594
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,990
you know,
because you'll find likeminded people.

595
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,560
Um,
but by doing that,

596
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:44,780
I think one of the things that separates
me is,

597
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,893
you know,
I don't shoot just all 20 year old 

598
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:47,784
hipsters,
you know,

599
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,550
old and young and,
and that,

600
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,163
that brand comes across in the variety 
of people I shoot because I actually 

601
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:55,764
have something to say and I can do that 
as opposed to saying one thing over and 

602
00:26:58,831 --> 00:26:59,664
over.
It gives me a wider vocabulary to be 

603
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:02,844
able to shoot people in a lot of 
different ways and a lot of different 

604
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,410
types of people.
But you always know it's one of my shots

605
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,450
and that's because you to take it very 
seriously.

606
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,740
And uh,
and I have a real passionate about,

607
00:27:11,741 --> 00:27:14,780
I have a real point of view.
And uh,

608
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,190
so I think,
you know,

609
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,023
that's what someone has to do before 
just deciding that I think I want to go 

610
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:23,190
out and take pictures of people on the 
street and like they really have to have

611
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,520
a point of view.
You know,

612
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,900
it's very important what I don't shoot 
as opposed to what I do.

613
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:28,734
Shoot.
There's a lot of people in the fashion 

614
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:31,480
business I've never shot.
Um,

615
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,710
so without a,
a real passionate point of view,

616
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:37,110
I don't think there's anything you can 
do because then it just becomes a,

617
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,413
a report on product and there's a lot of
blogs like that and I think they're 

618
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,800
incredibly boring,
you know,

619
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,500
just a report of what's out there,
doesn't do anything for me.

620
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,300
Well,
passion and a point of view,

621
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,610
number one,
consistency.

622
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:54,883
You know,
you have to be able to create a 

623
00:27:55,891 --> 00:28:00,060
consistent voice because if you're 
blogging in a real way,

624
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:00,760
you know,
uh,

625
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,810
I think you have to do it very 
regularly.

626
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:04,644
If it's not five days a week or six days
a week in a way that people start to 

627
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:10,290
know when they can come see your blog,
um,

628
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,573
when there's going to be new images up 
that always doesn't have to be exactly 

629
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:16,520
the same time every day.
You know,

630
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,363
it's not so bad to keep them guessing.
That's so bad to have him coming back 

631
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:19,734
once or twice,
but there has to be consistency in the 

632
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:24,990
voice because you just can't fake it 
five days a week.

633
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,440
Um,
so I think that's really important.

634
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:32,520
Uh,
I think next generation of blogs,

635
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:35,190
it's going to be just like the beginning
of what websites,

636
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:36,024
you know,
you could kind of do it on your own and 

637
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:40,560
kind of habit and it didn't look great 
necessarily,

638
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:41,130
but now,
you know,

639
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:44,070
blogs are getting very sophisticated and
uh,

640
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:47,040
I think people are going to have to 
really start to be serious about the way

641
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:47,940
the blog looks.

642
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,840
That's,
you know,

643
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,230
the days I think of,
um,

644
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,413
just being able to steal images from all
over the place to put them on your blog 

645
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:57,960
and just putting another two cents in on
somebody else's conversation.

646
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,063
It's pretty close to over because the 
blog is not gonna be able to grow that 

647
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,364
way.
The blog is only going to be able to 

648
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:05,970
grow once you're in control of all the 
content.

649
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,810
And like that's why street style blogs 
have grown so quickly is,

650
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:10,983
you know,
we're in control of the visuals were in 

651
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:14,100
control of the writing.
You know,

652
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:15,840
if you're using a particular kind of 
blog,

653
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:19,290
you can be more in control of the ponds 
and the graphics and everything else.

654
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,340
I don't know,
you can't really do anything.

655
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,270
Yeah,
I mean,

656
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:27,000
at least for me anyway,
because I'm,

657
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,100
you know,
it's so many different things.

658
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:32,040
You know what I mean?
It's the clothes themselves,

659
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:34,140
it's the person.
Uh,

660
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,503
it's,
uh,

661
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,260
I just have to,
you know,

662
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,550
that's the artist,
you know,

663
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:40,970
there's no,
I wish I could say as a marketer,

664
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,390
you know,
if you're wearing this brand and blah,

665
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:44,224
blah,
blah,

666
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,260
that will make it really interesting,
but it's not,

667
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:48,280
you know,
that's the artist in me,

668
00:29:48,281 --> 00:29:50,350
you know,
sometimes you meet someone and it's just

669
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:51,370
something that clicks,
you know,

670
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:52,204
and it might be an obvious kind of 
beauty or a non obvious kind of beauty 

671
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,410
or just something that you feel,
you know,

672
00:29:57,411 --> 00:30:01,510
I shut this woman in,
I'm in Barcelona the other day,

673
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:03,900
this beautiful older woman and she,
you know,

674
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:09,750
really beautifully aged face and very 
perfectly done hair and fur coat.

675
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,743
And um,
she was definitely not typical 

676
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,750
traditional beauty,
but there was just something so charming

677
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,740
about her and I don't think she'd ended 
up on anybody else's blog,

678
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:21,574
but you know,
that that is definitely part of my 

679
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:24,034
vocabulary.
And I'm sure she didn't get up that day 

680
00:30:26,171 --> 00:30:27,004
thinking,
what should I wear to be shocked by the 

681
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:30,520
Sartorialist I know he's in town.
Um,

682
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,811
but,
you know,

683
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:32,800
that's the fun of it.
You know,

684
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:34,930
you just never know.
There are people I see all the time that

685
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,430
you would think,
you know,

686
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,293
maybe be on the blog,
but if I don't feel something and don't 

687
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:42,310
feel that I'm going to be able to shoot 
it the way that I want,

688
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,910
then it doesn't really matter.
But all black is pretty boring.

689
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,753
You're going gonna do all black.
You better do some good proportion or 

690
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:51,580
texture or something like that.
Color pattern,

691
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,443
things like that.
That actually real elements of design 

692
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,460
are always a good one.
Good place to start.

693
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,510
My heroes are my mom and dad.
Um,

694
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,923
and uh,
I think just anyone that succeeds at 

695
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:15,601
what they do through really trying to do
something unique and difference and uh,

696
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,820
interesting something that maybe not the
people told them would never work.

697
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:23,900
But that's um,
you know,

698
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,390
really,
you know,

699
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,990
says something about who they are and 
how they saw something differently.

700
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,770
And,
uh,

701
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:30,970
and it's a bunch of different things,
you know,

702
00:31:30,971 --> 00:31:33,190
the guys that do the Mac computers,
you know,

703
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,080
that design for the Mac computers I 
think are great.

704
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,930
I don't know if they'd be a hero,
but someone I definitely look up to,

705
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:39,370
you know,
take that chance of saying,

706
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,130
you know,
we're going to do them in color now.

707
00:31:42,131 --> 00:31:45,490
And then knowing as someone that used to
work in the fashion business,

708
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,563
how tough that is to go to the stores 
and say we want you to buy these 

709
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,820
computers in color now and that they're 
going to come back and say,

710
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:52,750
oh,
how are you going to buy?

711
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,280
I don't know what color,
what percentage,

712
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,680
but what color and what computer and all
of that.

713
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,740
Some that has such a passion for 
something and is willing to really,

714
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,213
um,
go through all the steps and be able to 

715
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:06,040
sell that concept to somebody.
Um,

716
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,280
you know,
whether it's designing the Mac computer,

717
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,060
whether it's Armani and the eighties,
you know,

718
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,790
doing completely different kinds of 
design for women.

719
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,490
Whether it's,
um,

720
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:15,843
Bruce Weber kind of figuring out how to 
shoot people in a wholesome but sexy 

721
00:32:20,651 --> 00:32:21,461
way,
you know,

722
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:25,660
those are the people that look at that.
I think I'm most inspired by in terms of

723
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:29,980
their work,
an ethical dilemma.

724
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,640
Um,
I don't think it was an ethical dilemma,

725
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:34,474
but I did have to figure out how I would
handle having advertising on the blog 

726
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,740
because I knew that there would be 
certain people saying,

727
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,131
oh,
well,

728
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:43,964
you know,
here it goes,

729
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,913
you know,
blogs are going to go downhill because 

730
00:32:45,911 --> 00:32:48,570
they're gonna have advertising and 
they're just going to shoot him.

731
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,050
American apparel was one of the first 
advertisers on the site.

732
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,150
And I was prepared for people to start 
saying,

733
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:55,430
no,
now we're going to start seeing a lot of

734
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:58,820
American apparel or whatever.
But that never happened.

735
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,743
You know,
I think the sincerity and the integrity 

736
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:01,520
of the blog,
the fact that,

737
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:02,763
um,
I was able to have advertising and it's 

738
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:04,964
never affected any of the work on the 
site that you never see anything about 

739
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:08,444
American apparel on the site.
Unless it's something that I see in 

740
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,340
someone happens to be wearing American 
apparel that didn't.

741
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,480
Absolute integrity and sincerity is 
still there.

742
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:19,700
I just shot a big story for Berberi big 
ad campaign and I announced it because I

743
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:23,300
was very proud of the work and showed 
some of the pictures I really liked from

744
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,070
that project.
And uh,

745
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:25,963
probably did three or four posts,
but I didn't put anything in there 

746
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:28,770
about,
you know,

747
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,460
where to buy the trenches,
no information about it.

748
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,420
I was just showing the photographs I was
very proud of from that project.

749
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,910
And the audience totally understood it,
you know,

750
00:33:37,911 --> 00:33:39,350
they,
they,

751
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,820
um,
but at the same time,

752
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,490
I love burberry and that was very happy 
to work with that.

753
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:47,000
And I think the new reality is sometimes
people have a hard time handling.

754
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:49,010
The new reality is,
you know,

755
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:50,010
um,
uh,

756
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,000
you know,
I'm an artist and I'm a,

757
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,410
um,
I guess,

758
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:55,450
you know,
that's the only way you could say it.

759
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,710
I don't really consider myself a 
journalist.

760
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,993
I'm not trying to sell you something.
I'm not trying to tell you the story of 

761
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:02,180
these things.
I'm just showing you my pictures,

762
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,253
so I feel totally comfortable saying I 
love burberry or Ralph Lauren or 

763
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:10,520
whatever because uh,
those are things that I like and um,

764
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,560
so that's know that's hard for some 
people to be able to understand that,

765
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,113
but because it's so consistent and I've 
been so consistent in how I present 

766
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:26,111
those things and how I let them be 
manifest themselves on the blog,

767
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,793
that's what I think has been able to 
keep the sincerity and keep the 

768
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:33,350
audience.
I'm believing in what I do.

769
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,420
The worst career advice.
Uh,

770
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,653
I don't know.
I've never really had much career 

771
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,453
advice.
My Dad always gave me great advice and 

772
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:47,840
um,
you know,

773
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,380
I think,
uh,

774
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,131
I mean,
I hate to say it,

775
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:49,490
but,
you know,

776
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:52,720
I wasn't a good corporate person.
They know everything that,

777
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,080
uh,
made me horrible.

778
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,360
Working in incorporation was perfect for
this kind of job.

779
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,194
So,
uh,

780
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,423
uh,
I never really got bad advice because I 

781
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:04,871
never really asked for any think it'd be
maybe like Pablo Picasso.

782
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,480
I think he was probably crazy.
I mean,

783
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,370
I know he was crazy.
I think everyone says he was crazy.

784
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,473
So I think you just wouldn't know what 
would happen at dinner and I'd love to 

785
00:35:13,551 --> 00:35:16,880
talk to them about art and how he 
challenged himself and was always trying

786
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:20,300
to look for a new way of expressing his 
artistic,

787
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:23,600
uh,
his artistic expression or whatever.

788
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:24,680
But,
uh,

789
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,513
I think he also would probably do 
something crazy at dinner in and that 

790
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:30,830
would be fun.
Maybe him and Tracy Morgan,

791
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,350
the fact that,
uh,

792
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:39,870
I always thought I knew better than the 
people I was working for.

793
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,743
That's not good.
That's not a good thing to think that 

794
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:50,190
you always know better than the people 
that your bosses and and always create a

795
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,024
problem for me.
I always thought I had a good point of 

796
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:53,700
view on this,
that and whatever.

797
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,550
And it turned out to be okay.
But,

798
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:57,570
you know,
at some point,

799
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,693
you know,
you always created problems for me 

800
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:01,650
working corporately.
And uh,

801
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,680
so at some point my dad said,
you know,

802
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:07,380
we can't always be them at some point.
It's got to be you.

803
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,020
You're the only thing that's consistent 
in this and that's hard.

804
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:11,160
You don't want to hear that from your 
dad.

805
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,340
Um,
but I know was probably true and I think

806
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:17,390
it helped me realize that either I got 
to put up or shut up and uh,

807
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,050
and so I'm glad that's when I went out 
and worked on my own.

808
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,500
I don't have all the answers,
but,

809
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,613
you know,
I really had to push myself to handle 

810
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:26,940
all the different areas,
you know,

811
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:27,774
because it's not just photography,
it's running the business and its 

812
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,400
accounting,
all these different kinds of things.

813
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:33,670
So,
you know,

814
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,370
now I have,
I have,

815
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,283
um,
the challenge of actually trying to go 

816
00:36:37,831 --> 00:36:42,300
out there and learn a lot of different 
things to make it all keep going.
