1
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,780
That's hard for me to predict.
I know that this is a topic that to

2
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:14,960
Michael Claire and other people have
promoted as the idea that we're going to

3
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:16,180
fight over water,
oil,

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,780
a timber,
you name it.

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,240
Um,
what I see is a,

6
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:23,390
is a world becoming more interdependent
in everything.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,000
My book,
the thesis of my book Gusher of lies is

8
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:29,510
really that the world is interdependent
in any number of commodities,

9
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:32,480
whether it's ipods or beer or fresh
flowers,

10
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:34,820
tennis shoes,
and that interdependence is going to

11
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:39,710
strengthen actually in the coming years
because we have no choice as different

12
00:00:39,711 --> 00:00:40,760
companies.
I'm sorry,

13
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:43,820
it's different.
Countries become better at producing

14
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:46,400
certain commodities.
They will assert their influence in the

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,270
marketplace.
And my book debunks the idea that energy

16
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:53,960
independence as possible,
that it's doable or even desirable for

17
00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:55,850
the US.
What we really need to be looking at is

18
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:56,900
interdependence.

19
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,180
Um,
and that is in fact what the market and

20
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,800
energy and other commodities has had
for,

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,870
for decades and will continue to have
there.

22
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:04,460
There clearly is a lot of,
uh,

23
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,060
of rhetoric about the issue of oil and
fighting over oil.

24
00:01:08,061 --> 00:01:11,990
I think what I see in the future as
natural gas becomes a more critical

25
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:14,360
player in the global economy.
It is a,

26
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,300
I think,
much more of a bind necessity.

27
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:22,301
It is a much more cooperative.
Commercial enterprise pipelines require

28
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,340
a stronger connections between
countries,

29
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,370
uh,
and gas really is only effectively moved

30
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:29,720
in at the moment,
uh,

31
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,820
by gas pipeline.
We're going to see on an emerging gas

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,340
market that has global due to the
increasing use of liquified natural gas

33
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:40,430
and I think compressed natural gas,
which is not in the market yet,

34
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,200
uh,
in any significant degree,

35
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:43,610
uh,
at least in the marine market.

36
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,040
But I,
I,

37
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,460
I think I would argue the opposite.
That I think as the world gets a more

38
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:51,350
integrated,
as the market for energy gets more

39
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:53,900
integrated,
I think that we're going to see a

40
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,410
further cooperation among countries
because it is in their commercial

41
00:01:57,411 --> 00:01:58,940
interest.
And in fact,

42
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:00,650
if you look at what has happened with
the,

43
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,790
uh,
with your ran,

44
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,880
despite America's efforts to isolate the
Iranians,

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,790
what we are,
in fact seeing as the Iranians making

46
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:10,970
multiple commercial deals with numerous
countries around the world,

47
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,250
uh,
whether it's the Brazilians,

48
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,490
the Turks,
the Austrians,

49
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,450
the Iranians are integrating their
economy and their energy commodities

50
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,940
into the global economy and doing it
very effectively.
