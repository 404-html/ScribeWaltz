1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,680
No,
it's very fun.

2
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:09,610
It's like terminator,
Terminator.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,300
No,
I just liked the scan things and then

4
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:16,220
something or wonder woman in a bionic
woman.

5
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:19,010
But,
but something attracts the attention and

6
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:21,390
I zero in.
And it's funny because it can be

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,620
millions of objects and uh,
um,

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,650
so at that point it's almost irrational.
What attracts me about that object?

9
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:30,180
But usually there's something,
you know,

10
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:32,360
I go in and dig deeper.
Um,

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,860
so it's not a first impression.
It's not superficial.

12
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:36,670
It's almost as if the work
communication.

13
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:39,480
Sorry if I sound a little new agey here
at animistic,

14
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:42,370
but it really works that way.
And uh,

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,470
what I do,
I spend my day without thinking scanning

16
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:48,150
things and uh,
I,

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,090
I already noticed your shirt and I
already noticed,

18
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:53,340
you know,
I already noticed everything about you

19
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:55,680
without even thinking it could be a good
detective perhaps,

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,010
you know,
um,

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,280
and uh,
uh,

22
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:02,580
and what attracts me in an object is
some sort of communication that the

23
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:05,100
designer already instilled in the
object.

24
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,933
Because you know,
what,

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,240
if you notice today,
the objects that are considered most

26
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:14,130
interesting are the ones that are in
doubt by the designer with some sort of

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,780
a,
how can I say,

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,840
some sort of grabbing a element that
attracts more than your attention,

29
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,220
you know,
that attracts really your interest.

30
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,670
And this happens with all sorts of
objects.

31
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:27,730
That's why,
you know,

32
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,660
I was doing an interview once,
I was interviewing Johnny Ive,

33
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:35,130
who's the head designer for apple.
He hardly ever gives interviews and I

34
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:36,310
was really lucky that,
you know,

35
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,180
we're friends,
but you know,

36
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,040
I convinced him to give an interview,
but we started talking about this,

37
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,470
about the communication,
um,

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,070
that objects have with people.
Because to me one of the most stunning

39
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:49,890
features of apple computers is the
little breathing light.

40
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,870
You know,
the little breathing light that tells

41
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:55,080
you that the computer is leaping,
is asleep and not turned off.

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,210
I mean,
that's amazing.

43
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,490
It makes you think that the computer has
a heart,

44
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,030
you know?
So it's this little touches that people

45
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,870
noticed subliminally that differentiate
certain objects from others.
