1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,770
Yeah,

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,890
I haven't made any public comment on it
and I'm not going to start on this show.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,960
Everybody has a timeline of the time
that you have to come to vote,

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,210
but I think that it's likely to be
decided before then and,

5
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,170
uh,
I,

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,270
I probably will decide along with most
others.

7
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,250
I think Howard Dean was suggested at the
end of June,

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,940
if I'm not mistaken.
Uh,

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,580
I'm from Maine.
I represented main in the Senate,

10
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,360
but I'm now a resident of New York.
Primarily I,

11
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,940
when I left the Senate,
I remarried.

12
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,250
I had young children.
My children go to school here.

13
00:00:57,251 --> 00:00:58,960
So you sort of,
that's what you end up,

14
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,200
uh,
as a voting taxpaying citizen.

15
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,300
Uh,
uh,

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,560
when Obama won the main caucus,
I got a bunch of letters and calls from

17
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:12,070
people because they.
And I thought I'd be a,

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,960
again,
a superdelegate for me and I've been a

19
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:15,880
sub delegate from Maine since I left the
Senate.

20
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,583
And,
uh,

21
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,820
uh,
they said,

22
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:20,590
well,
Obama won in Maine,

23
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:25,300
so you should vote for Obama.
Then a Clinton won in New York.

24
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,030
Uh,
uh,

25
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,680
and I got a few calls from Clinton,
people saying,

26
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:32,140
well,
you live in New York,

27
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,670
you ought to vote for Clinton because
she wanted New York.

28
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,040
And then the Democratic National
Committee announced,

29
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:39,880
yes,
in fact,

30
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:42,250
I would be a adult soup delegate from
New York.

31
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:46,420
So then I started getting calls from my
Obama friends making a completely

32
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:49,630
different argument.
And both sides argument have shifted

33
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:51,060
over time.
Uh,

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,390
if you say a d,
should you,

35
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:58,390
should I vote in accordance with the
majority in the state?

36
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,030
That's New York.
Then I would vote for Clinton.

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,540
Should I vote for the majority in my
congressional district?

38
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,250
Should I vote for who wins the popular
vote nationwide?

39
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,610
Should that popular vote include or
exclude Florida,

40
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,840
which is likely to be a determining
factor?

41
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,940
Who Wins?
I mean,

42
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,610
each of these has an argument in and of
itself,

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,470
but I guess my feeling is I feel much
like I did in the Senate when I had to

44
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:25,930
advise a consent on presidential
nominations.

45
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:28,270
The constitution doesn't define what you
do.

46
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:31,900
So I think I should use my best judgment
taking into account and give,

47
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,760
given great weight to the way others
have voted.

48
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,370
And there are,
as I just mentioned,

49
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:43,060
numerous iterations of that you can look
at one of several factors,

50
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,640
including the number of delegates they
have,

51
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:47,920
one through the elective process,
but in the end,

52
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:52,921
making a judgment which my conscience
and judgment tells me is the person who

53
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:57,280
will best serve the nation.
And as a Democrat who will be most

54
00:02:57,281 --> 00:02:58,300
likely to be elected.

55
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,140
Uh,
if I did,

56
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:08,960
I wouldn't tell you because that would
of course that defeat the purpose of any

57
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,640
mediation.
Uh,

58
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,250
uh,
and I don't.

59
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:15,100
So I'm not giving any secrets from you.
Uh,

60
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,070
and I don't think it's likely to happen.
I,

61
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,970
I think it's all going to work out
before then.

62
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,720
I know you're not a reporter in the
strictest sense,

63
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:25,540
but you know,
the press has an interest in

64
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:30,570
controversy,
keeping it going and devising scenarios

65
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:36,871
that suggest a conflict right down to
the last minute of the last hour of the

66
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:41,170
last roll call at the convention and
maybe beyond.

67
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,810
But I think reality is to the contrary,
I think it is likely to be resolved to

68
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,200
not too long after the last primary or
caucus.

69
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,400
That's not very far away.
We've waited this long.

70
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,210
We can wait another week.
