1
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,530
Controlled for a reason,
they are dangerous.

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,590
Drugs are wonderful drugs when you have
a medical need for them.

3
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:16,690
In fact,
most of the medical needs have

4
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:19,000
disappeared over the years for anabolic
steroids,

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,580
radios,
other drugs,

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,870
what are anabolic steroids,
anabolic steroids,

7
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:27,040
and nothing more or less than synthetic
derivatives of the male hormone,

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,290
testosterone,
uh,

9
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,830
and uh,
uh,

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,150
molecules have been modified for a
variety of reasons where she can get

11
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:37,410
into,
but fundamentally a,

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,420
they're all variations of the
testosterone molecule and you know,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
we have a surgeon that and puberty and
that it levels off or people have taken

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,660
a anabolic steroids to try to become
more than they otherwise would be.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,900
So they're looking for increased
strength,

16
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:03,280
improve recovery time,
more aggressiveness and assertiveness.

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,970
A more acceleration,
uh,

18
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,280
it,
it does work.

19
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,060
It can't just take the anabolic steroid,
go to sleep,

20
00:01:13,061 --> 00:01:14,600
wake up stronger.
Uh,

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,530
you do have to work out,
they have to put your muscles under

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,780
stress and resistive exercises.

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,470
You have to be in a high protein diet.
And there was a big debate for many

24
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,760
years.
The American Medical Association for

25
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:26,620
years did nothing.
Well,

26
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,170
the athletes knew better.
It clearly does work,

27
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,090
but it is clearly dangerous and they
side effects can be in the short term,

28
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:35,550
the long term,
some are protected,

29
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,370
some are not protectable,
some of all the secondary sex

30
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:43,270
characteristics and effects on other
parts of the body.

31
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,370
Uh,
the psychiatric effects.

32
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:48,460
There's a profound depression when you
stop these drugs.

33
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,160
Uh,
we can talk about that later as well,

34
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:56,161
but there's a for teenagers as a
particular concern in that they will

35
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:58,960
close their growth centers and their
long bones,

36
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,770
so they never achieved there.
They're genetically determined height.

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,710
They're going to permanently shorter
than they would have been otherwise.

38
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,650
And for teenagers,
very importantly,

39
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:11,770
as well as other abuses,
severe acne is coming.

40
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:13,840
So that's part of the package as well.

41
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,220
There are some effects that could affect
a teenager's men and women alike.

42
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,740
Are those things that affect women?
There are,

43
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:31,000
those things were fixed.
Teenagers and those things that affect

44
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,010
males.
The simplest term a male becomes

45
00:02:36,011 --> 00:02:37,600
feminized.
Why?

46
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,470
Because in the body,
testosterone is transformed into the

47
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:45,310
female hormone estrogen.
And so you'll see a high pitched voice,

48
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,860
uh,
development of breasts,

49
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,250
a shrinkage of their testicles.
A changing their hair patterns,

50
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,850
they literally become feminized while
they're trying to get increasingly

51
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,870
masculinized sort of a strange paradox.
They also get bigger and stronger,

52
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,140
but they also get families and some of
those changes permanent.

53
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,470
Conversely,
a woman that takes anabolic steroids

54
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,330
becomes masculinized associated,
will develop a deep voice,

55
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,050
develop facial hair,
a clitoral enlargement,

56
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,840
menstrual irregularities,
uh,

57
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:22,900
and a large Adam's apple.
Uh,

58
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:27,160
so they've very much become the
direction of a male.

59
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,840
And as far as teenagers a concern,
the thing that's unique to them of

60
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,120
course,
as is the growth centers and the fact

61
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,080
that they never reached their full
genetic potential if they take these

62
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,060
things long enough.
So,

63
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,510
uh,
each segment of the population has its

64
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,120
unique consequences from abusing
anabolic steroids.

65
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,900
Well,
I can tell you a very concrete example.

66
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,000
Uh,
there's a,

67
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,750
about three years ago,
I got a phone call one day from Mr Don.

68
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,900
Don Hooten,
who lived in Texas,

69
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,060
had a son who was 16 years old,
who pitched for,

70
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,430
for his baseball team in Plano.
Texas was very good.

71
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,450
Coincidentally,
had a cousin who played in the major

72
00:04:20,451 --> 00:04:22,210
leagues,
uh,

73
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,680
by the name of Bert Hooten,
uh,

74
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,460
at the end of the season.
And his coach said,

75
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:30,320
look,
you want to get to the major leagues

76
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:33,140
like your cousin.
You just keep working the way you are,

77
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:35,600
but you've got to get bigger.
I left the event.

78
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,430
Well being in Texas,
it was very hard to get to Mexico and

79
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:43,250
Mexico.
Anabolic steroids are readily available

80
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,270
and so off.
When the son Taylor Hudl and in fact got

81
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,270
bigger,
stronger acne and personality changed.

82
00:04:57,271 --> 00:05:02,271
Roid rage puts a visceral wall,
very significant breakup on his

83
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,130
relationship with his girlfriend's
parents,

84
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,150
for them around to various experts in
understand what was going on.

85
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,300
A parents finally said,
look,

86
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:19,301
you have to stop this.
And he did one day and went up to his

87
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,400
room,
took two belts and hanged himself,

88
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,660
called me shortly thereafter and said,
he just felt compelled to share this

89
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:34,490
horrible story with other parents so
they don't want up in a similar

90
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:37,550
situation.
And I suggested to him that he

91
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:40,910
established a not for profit foundation
educational foundation,

92
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,990
which will,
uh,

93
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,940
devote itself to getting this message
out.

94
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,570
And that gave rise to the tail,
the Hilton Foundation,

95
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:55,571
which I'm chairman of the board and Mr
[inaudible] testified as I did before

96
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:59,120
the hearings in Congress baseball,
uh,

97
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,050
and,
uh,

98
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,350
at the Metro report you met with Senator
Mitchell,

99
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,330
uh,
leadership in many aspects of this

100
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:10,010
field.
And,

101
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,500
uh,
we're happy to report that makes me

102
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:16,450
baseball actually is granted in a
substantial amount of money to Taylor

103
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,960
who foundation to do what we call is a
hoot,

104
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,970
hoots chalk talks and which we will run
it all 30 major league stadiums around

105
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:26,300
the United States.

106
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,720
A session is devoted to steroid abuse
prevention and healthy alternatives to

107
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,540
using steroids.
So it's a long way of saying that it was

108
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:41,450
a very significant price to pay a in
this.

109
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:42,284
And,
uh,

110
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,730
you know,
we heard about the wrestling case of a

111
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,260
restaurant now when he committed
suicide,

112
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,010
killed his wife and young child.
Uh,

113
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,530
these are horrible stories,
but they're not rare.

114
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,590
And then not unpredictable.
Uh,

115
00:06:57,591 --> 00:07:02,591
and most people don't recognize or
concentrated on the psychiatric aspects

116
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,660
of steroid abuse as much as they do on
some of the other aspects,

117
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,680
particularly was doing baseball records
in the line.

118
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,514
Yeah.

119
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,960
We have parents
recognize that a teenager has increased

120
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,030
in their own testosterone and another
individual in the same age group may

121
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,080
have a rise because they're taking
testosterone or other anabolic steroids.

122
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:42,081
So how do you distinguish a kid?
It was going through a difficult

123
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,460
adolescence,
took no drugs,

124
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,210
but as a lot of acne is irritable,
changing his relationships with his

125
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:55,590
friends,
a wants to look good.

126
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:56,700
Well,
so the gym,

127
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:02,220
how do you take that individual and
contrast that for a parent and I suspect

128
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,810
that their kid is using drugs and got
acne and going to the gym and doing all

129
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:10,440
these things.
They have to a,

130
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:15,441
be aware that it's a possibility in this
day and age and it's a sad thing to say

131
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,750
that they're adolescents,
in fact,

132
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:22,590
maybe using anabolic steroids,
but they also have to recognize.

133
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:26,770
I can make that assumption.
It may be that the kids are already

134
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,930
going through a difficult adolescence.
Imagine how bad it can be suddenly your

135
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:33,960
parents questioning you and your
behaviors,

136
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,560
so if in doubt you have to seek a
solution with a physician and share that

137
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:44,610
information with your physician.
And then there are ways to evaluate

138
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,640
what's the tool is at play here.
But you know,

139
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:52,641
for the average teenager it may be not
so obvious whether this is natural,

140
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,090
whether this is driving.
