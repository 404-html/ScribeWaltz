1
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,640
All kinds of modern,
amazing things were happening at the

2
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:12,850
beginning of the 20th century,
especially in the United States of

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,990
America and,
and the movies and Hollywood.

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,060
We're one of those things that we kind
of,

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,180
uh,
I think have lost track of how,

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,780
what a quantum shift watching movies,
uh,

7
00:00:25,781 --> 00:00:30,030
represented for the experience of life.
I'm sure there,

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,830
there had been actors in plays before,
but,

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,920
um,
uh,

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,230
the,
the first of all,

11
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:35,670
the,
the,

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,670
the glut of entertainment that suddenly
existed in the almost phantasmagorical

13
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:45,871
quality of watching real people moving
around that were in front of you,

14
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:50,140
but in some nether world and film and
they were really in London or,

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,101
or,
or,

16
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:53,200
or in India or,
or,

17
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,510
uh,
the Yukon or whatever.

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,071
The,
the,

19
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:56,850
the,
and,

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,650
and,
and time was suddenly changed that when

21
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:04,651
from childhood to adulthood,
everything about the cinema was w w we

22
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:08,550
have to understand what a huge change
that was and,

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,280
and how,
how mutable it seemed to make reality.

24
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,490
So you take that,
that the,

25
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,300
the fact of cinema,
TV,

26
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:19,750
video,
everything we now for five generations

27
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:24,751
have taken as the way things are.
So that that gave us,

28
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,710
gave us,
and especially Americans,

29
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,350
obviously French people and English
people as well,

30
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:31,360
but this,
this idea that,

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,780
that reality was mutable.
Then on top of that,

32
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:37,210
and with that you have this,
this,

33
00:01:37,211 --> 00:01:38,890
uh,
celebrity culture,

34
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:39,971
uh,
where,

35
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:43,330
where celebrity itself is,
uh,

36
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,480
there are my orders of magnitudes.
Suddenly more celebrities.

37
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,930
There were,
you know,

38
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,300
in the 19th century and earlier there
were,

39
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,640
there were a famous people,
but a few of them and,

40
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,773
and,
uh,

41
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,451
uh,
and,

42
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:57,284
and,
and,

43
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,900
and now there were hundreds and then
eventually thousands of famous people

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,590
who were now famous for pretending to be
somebody else,

45
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,080
actors.
That was a strange new condition.

46
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,640
And,
and so,

47
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,100
uh,
for a long time,

48
00:02:12,101 --> 00:02:14,200
for much of the 20th century,
uh,

49
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,060
people looked up to,
to,

50
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,150
to movie stars because they seem to have
real potency in this world where,

51
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,060
uh,
individuals seen more and more part of a

52
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:25,870
mass here.

53
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,060
Here were the people because they were
famous.

54
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:30,970
And because we watched them and stared
at them and dreamed about them,

55
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:31,991
we're,
we're,

56
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:33,180
we're the,
the little,

57
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:38,181
we're like superheros or demi gods.
So by the end of the 20th century or

58
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,200
before the end of the 20th century,
who wouldn't?

59
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,050
If you're,
uh,

60
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,330
uh,
an American,

61
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,760
uh,
steeped in this movie and then

62
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:48,520
television culture,
I want to be famous.

63
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,710
Maybe there's no reason for you to be
famous,

64
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:55,180
but my God,
only famous people have real agency in

65
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:56,320
the world.
So,

66
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,140
uh,
we got to to that where,

67
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,940
where fame is own,
uh,

68
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,090
end.
Um,

69
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,040
you also again,
uh,

70
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,820
there's advertising everywhere,
but advertising and the advertising

71
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:08,710
industry,
we're really an American invention

72
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:10,420
starting way back in the 18 hundreds,
when,

73
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,620
when,
uh,

74
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,790
for instance,
uh,

75
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,100
the political candidate,
presidential candidate,

76
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:18,910
William Henry Harrison,
was the first marketed or advertised

77
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:19,960
presidential candidate.

78
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,460
He,
he was this,

79
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,880
this rich guy who they wanted to rebrand
as a humble guy,

80
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,180
had grown up in a log cabin.
So log cabins became his,

81
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,920
his,
his icon,

82
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:30,754
his,
his,

83
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,760
his branding symbol.
And they made real big ones and little

84
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:35,550
ones and,
and liquor and,

85
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,371
and,
and,

86
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:39,940
and facial creams in,
in log cabin containers.

87
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,100
And they made chants and songs and he
won by a landslide over a guy who was

88
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,320
actually of humble origins.
So,

89
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,070
uh,
advertising as part of this fantasy

90
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:55,540
industrial complex that is so American
and so defining of America,

91
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,530
uh,
has,

92
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,260
has become,
has been a big part of what we're

93
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:01,480
talking about as well.
Disneyland.

94
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,310
Uh,
I love Disneyland.

95
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,293
Uh,
but,

96
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,570
but it,
it became when it was created in the

97
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:09,310
1950s,
uh,

98
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,340
not just as a little amusement park to,
to promote Walt Disney's animated films,

99
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,290
but as this other version of reality
that was more,

100
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,580
that was real in the,
it was there,

101
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:28,450
you could go there and buy things that
these old fashion shops on main street,

102
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:32,680
USA with actors,
but they were selling you stuff.

103
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,640
Uh,
what's,

104
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,080
what happened in Disneyland and starting
in 1955 did not stay there.

105
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,000
And that Main Street USA,
most of all became a kind of model for

106
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,350
how you build shopping centers,
how you build a suburbs,

107
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,240
how you theme everything,
uh,

108
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,160
from restaurants to hotels to,
to two shops to clubs.

109
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,290
So,
uh,

110
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,830
the,
the,

111
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,180
the Hollywood idea and,
and what came before in pop culture and

112
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:04,450
what came after and,
and as it expanded to sort of subsume

113
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:07,090
all of American life is,
is,

114
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:07,930
is,
uh,

115
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,780
is a big part of,
of,

116
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,020
of how we as Americans have become so
iffy about telling what's fake from

117
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,210
what's real,
what's true from what's false.
