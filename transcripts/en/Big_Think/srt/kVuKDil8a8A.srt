1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,320
Everybody should be asking

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,320
selves what are their constraints and
how can I use just a,

3
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,450
a part of that to tackle a problem
that's always bothered me,

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,850
that will help somebody else.
And how can I take that small step?

5
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:26,660
What car should I join?
What's the next thing that needs to be

6
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:30,710
solved,
and how can I get some satisfaction from

7
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:32,540
doing it?
Because if you don't get the

8
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,760
satisfaction,
this isn't pure altruism.

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,450
If you don't get the satisfaction,
you're not going to keep on doing it.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,110
So what can I find that with truly give
me joy,

11
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,530
but we'll also at the same time just
make my corner of the world slightly

12
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:48,680
better.
