1
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,580
I think the notion that Barack Obama is
a radical is preposterous.

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,100
Uh,
Henry Louis Gates Jr who,

3
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:20,130
um,
is quoted in my book is saying that the

4
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:23,100
only radical thing,
the only truly radical thing about

5
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:25,230
Barack Obama is that he's African
American.

6
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,790
And I think that's true that his
politics are center center left.

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,430
They come out of the tradition of the
Democratic Party in many ways.

8
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:39,030
They're continuations of lines taken by
the Clinton administration.

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,750
You know,
look at the healthcare bill itself.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,300
This is a more modest healthcare
building.

11
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:49,450
Many proposed by others.
He got what he could get and he

12
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:51,030
succeeded.
Um,

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,650
look at these.
So cold.

14
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:55,020
I'm radical.
Uh,

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,900
nuclear arms treaty just signed with the
Russians.

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,990
There's a lot of criticism on the right
saying,

17
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:02,970
you know,
Barack Obama is giving away our

18
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:04,410
security.
He is,

19
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:07,890
um,
he is stripping us of our capacity to

20
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,190
project strength in the world and to
protect ourselves.

21
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:16,190
And in fact the great leftwinger Ronald
Reagan was far more radical when it came

22
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:21,870
to nuclear arms policy.
Remember Reykjavik in the period then

23
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:26,871
Gorbachev Reagan period where those two
men were intent on reducing nuclear

24
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:32,490
stockpiles to nothing.
And here we've reduced it by a third.

25
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:36,300
I mean we,
we there the notion that Barack Obama

26
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:39,090
was somehow came out of a radical
cauldron in,

27
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,690
in,
in Chicago and somewhere in his desk

28
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:43,940
drawer,
um,

29
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,510
in the resolute desk in the Oval Office
as a copy of Mark's and grom.

30
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:53,511
She and Lennon is just obscene.
It's ridiculous.

31
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,030
And there are just too many elements in
the media and in politics trying to

32
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:04,020
stoke these fires for those absurd
notions to disappear.

33
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,290
It's very difficult to see.
I look,

34
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,340
I think there is a legitimate
conservative opposition as you'd expect.

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,770
Of course that's going to happen.
There's going to be a legitimate

36
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,930
republican opposition.
There's going to be battles.

37
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,350
What concerns me is not that so much.
What concerns me deeply is the outer

38
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:29,390
edges of it and the nature of the outer
edges of it.

39
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:32,690
And the way it's though the outer edges
of it are provoked by certain

40
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:37,691
politicians and certain parts of the
Internet and television and cable

41
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:42,851
television and all the rest.
And the end result of some of that kind

42
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:48,311
of ugliness can be beyond our reckoning,
really beyond our reckoning.

43
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,140
And,
um,

44
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,450
I don't want to be too alarmist of it,
but I remember for example,

45
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:58,310
in Israeli politics during gets awkward
beans time when the far right there

46
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,670
stirred up to such a degree that the,
that the political atmosphere in certain

47
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:07,240
quarters became quite literally
murderous.

48
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,760
So I think we need to be very careful
about,

49
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,540
uh,
lumping everybody together in its,

50
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,980
even the tea party movement.
I might not agree with any of it,

51
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,430
but the extremes of it are really
alarming.
