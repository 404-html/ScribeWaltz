1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,143
Mm,

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,440
in the United States right now is many
people have noticed that we are,

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,990
uh,
we are seeing a huge escalation of our

4
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:14,750
long running culture war.
Unfortunately,

5
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:16,790
universities are right in the heart of
that.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,830
So the,
the right and especially right wing

7
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:22,580
media love to show video clips of
students saying outrageous things they

8
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:25,040
love to say.
The university is our bastions of

9
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,990
political correctness.
They've lost their minds.

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,110
The left is motivated to say no,
there's no not a problem.

11
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:33,170
There's nothing going on.
It's just that the right hates ideas.

12
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:37,190
They hate universities.
What Greg and I do in the book is we

13
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:37,821
say,
no,

14
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:38,471
we're,
we're,

15
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:39,890
we're going to cut through the culture
war.

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,540
Let's just look at what's going on.
Let's look at what a university should

17
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:45,780
do.
Um,

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,190
and so when we talk about identity
politics,

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,460
which is a controversial topic,
we start by saying,

20
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,680
of course you need identity politics.

21
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,740
Identity politics is not a bad thing.
Automatically.

22
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,650
Politics can be based on any
distinction.

23
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:05,651
It can be based on any group interest.
So for gay students or black students or

24
00:01:05,781 --> 00:01:08,450
women to organize,
that's identity politics,

25
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:13,370
that's perfectly legitimate.
The question is how are they organizing?

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,550
What's the overarching framework,
and we've seen two versions of it in

27
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:19,430
American history.
You can do it the way most of the civil

28
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:21,890
rights leaders did it.
Martin Luther King in particular,

29
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,680
where you draw a larger circle around
the group,

30
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,180
you emphasize what we have in common and
then you say some of our brothers and

31
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:33,710
sisters are being denied equal access,
equal opportunity or equal dignity.

32
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,190
That works.
That has worked historically in much

33
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:41,360
tougher times and zones and that works
and we'll work on college campuses.

34
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,410
The other way you do it,
which is growing on college campuses,

35
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,980
is common enemy identity politics.

36
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,220
It's based on the bed when notion me
against my brother,

37
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,340
me and my brother against our cousin,
me and my brother and cousin against the

38
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:57,560
stranger.
It's a very general principle of social

39
00:01:57,561 --> 00:01:59,810
psychology.
If you try to unite people,

40
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:02,840
let's all unite against them.
They're the bad people.

41
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,780
They are the cause of the problems.
Let's all stick together.

42
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,120
That's a really dangerous thing to do in
a multiethnic society,

43
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:14,690
especially in a university where we're
actually all trying to work together to

44
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:17,510
solve the problem we have to work on our
speech climate,

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,700
uh,
in the business world is called speak up

46
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:21,790
culture.
In the academic world.

47
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,920
It's called just basic openness to
ideas.

48
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,430
When you put people together and you
want them to talk,

49
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,670
of course people have a lot of different
goals and fears.

50
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,620
Nobody wants to say something stupid.
Nobody wants to say something.

51
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,500
We'll get them into trouble.
If you can create a really trusting

52
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:41,750
environment in which we're all in this
together,

53
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,930
contribute your ideas.
If someone says something that you think

54
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:45,770
it's wrong,
say,

55
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:48,110
so that's going to lead to more
innovation.

56
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:50,690
That's gonna lead to more progress.
But what if,

57
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,890
what if you have an environment in which
if I say something that offends anyone,

58
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,650
they can report me anonymously to hr or
some other,

59
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,350
some other entity.
I'm going to think three times before I

60
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:04,780
speak up.
That's what we have on campus.

61
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,490
I'm in the bathrooms at my university.
There are signs telling students had

62
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:12,190
report me anonymously.
If I say anything that offends them,

63
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,730
so I don't feel free to speak up when
I'm on campus,

64
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:18,970
I can speak more openly off campus,
but on campus,

65
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,390
I have to watch myself.
As one student said to a friend of mine,

66
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,830
my motto is silence is safer,
just shut up and you won't get in

67
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,220
trouble.

68
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,870
Now,
this is a terrible speech climate.

69
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,860
A university cannot function if people
are defensive in this way.

70
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,520
So in universities,
uh,

71
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,230
in,
in organizations that value innovation,

72
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,810
we have to not just encourage people to
speak.

73
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:43,180
We have to assure them that they're not
going to be shamed,

74
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,730
humiliated,
or punished for sharing an opinion and

75
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:46,630
good faith.
Look,

76
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,940
we have a culture war raging all around
us.

77
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:53,110
It's very easy to take offense.
People are understandably angry here

78
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:55,600
within these walls.
We have to put that aside.

79
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,120
We have to trust each other.
We have to give each of the benefit of

80
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:59,980
the doubt,
and it's going to be good for all of us

81
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:00,520
to do that.
