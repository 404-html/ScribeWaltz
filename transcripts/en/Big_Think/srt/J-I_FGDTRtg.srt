1
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,210
So there is so much career advice for
women.

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,930
Best career advice that you are not
getting is to invest.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,771
What?
What?

4
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:18,290
That has absolutely nothing to do with
my performance.

5
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:19,190
The job,
yes,

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,830
but it does have to do with having more
money.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,660
And if you are investing to the same
extent that the guys are that will on

8
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:30,200
average and has historically added to
your wealth,

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,690
hundreds of thousands of dollars for
some women,

10
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:34,820
millions of dollars over the course of
their lives.

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,170
What happens when you've got more money?
You can play looser,

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,080
right?
You can with more confidence.

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,000
Go in and ask for that promotion for
that overseas assignment.

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,010
Quit that job.
You cannot stand because that boss is

15
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:55,070
such a jerk.
Start Your own business.

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,530
You know,
test your own business.

17
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,790
The degrees of freedom,
when we've got more money are

18
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,980
substantial.
And I'll even take it,

19
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,520
you know,
all the way to also help us get to

20
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:08,600
equality with men.

21
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,930
That confidence in the workforce,
that equality ladies,

22
00:01:11,931 --> 00:01:15,410
we will not be equal with men until
we're financially equal with men.

23
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,440
So the best career advice you're not
getting is to invest.

24
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,770
I wish I didn't have to give you this
advice that I wish every company out

25
00:01:24,771 --> 00:01:28,190
there just let you be you,
you know,

26
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:31,670
and that you're just not comfortable
going in and negotiating for the raise

27
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:36,080
and not to force you to do it,
to pay close that gender pay gap,

28
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:41,410
pay everybody exactly what they're worth
and not make negotiating a core part of

29
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:46,670
getting compensated in this country.
So I wish I didn't have to do that.

30
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,890
Um,
but I do.

31
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,980
And so we have to accept the world as it
is today.

32
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:55,550
And so ladies,
you got to negotiate from the first job.

33
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,180
You just have to,
and let me give you the example why.

34
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,620
So I managed a lot of people over a lot
of years and I will tell you that every

35
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:06,710
year,
almost every guy who reported to me

36
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,970
before bonus time would come into my
office and tell me how much they wanted

37
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:14,270
to make.
And every guy every year typically told

38
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:17,720
me more than he was in the budget for.
And so think about what happens,

39
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,070
right?
Jim and Mary.

40
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,780
Jim and Mary are both in the budget for
a bonus or a raise of five each.

41
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,250
Jim Comes in,
tells me he wants 10 never hear from

42
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:32,330
Mary.
I giggle to myself that Jim,

43
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:35,990
he so crazy.
You know we're never paid him 10 well,

44
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:38,480
it comes around time to put the budget
together,

45
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,840
give out the raises are the bonuses and
I know my hr head and I both know Jim

46
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:46,460
wants 10 wow.
You know we're not going to pay him 10

47
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,180
you know his office door was closed the
other day and the guys on the street are

48
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:54,620
looking for someone like Jim.

49
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,480
And by the way,
he made a really good point.

50
00:02:56,481 --> 00:02:58,730
I totally forgot about the project he
did.

51
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,470
We'll pay him seven now how much does
Mary make?

52
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,510
The answer usually is five.
The right answer of course is three

53
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,930
because car,
just because Jim asked for more and I

54
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:13,420
choose to give him more,
doesn't mean my bonus pool goes up.

55
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,070
Doesn't mean my budget goes up.
And so there is to some extent a zero

56
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:20,080
sum game.
All right ladies.

57
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,980
Now that I've convinced you,
how do we approach it with facts,

58
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,080
so much of the [inaudible] and in
advance?

59
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,290
So much of the advice to us,
is it sort of in the meaning in the

60
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,750
moment you have to start planting those
seeds?

61
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:32,501
Well,
before,

62
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:34,330
first of all,
you need to know how much you should be

63
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:39,331
making and go to a payscale.com or get
raised are comparable he or higher to

64
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,260
any of these services that are popping
up.

65
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,840
Talk to your friends.
Have two glasses of wine or four.

66
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,780
You don't have the conversations.
Um,

67
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:50,920
so know how much you should make.
Have the conversation and advanced with

68
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:53,590
your boss about what are,
if possible,

69
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:55,930
the metrics,
how many new clean,

70
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,820
you know,
quantify to the extent you can.

71
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,280
How many new reports,
how many,

72
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,340
what kind of client satisfaction score,
how many new clients,

73
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:05,200
what in sales,
how many clean audits,

74
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:09,250
whatever it is you can quantify.
What does success look like?

75
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,240
So set that up for this is success for
me,

76
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,220
for the department,
for the company.

77
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,750
Here's what I need to achieve this year.
Here's what I want to make bright,

78
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,120
get an agreement.
And then the negotiation at the end of

79
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,340
year is not a negotiation,
you know,

80
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:25,420
to the extent,
of course,

81
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:28,150
then you come in,
you've done that or haven't done it.

82
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,580
Never take,
never have one.

83
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,870
Ask and take no for an answer that if
you're told no on the res or even if

84
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:37,660
you're told yes,
come in with 12 other request.

85
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,550
Right.
I want,

86
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,070
you know,
to take a coding class at the company

87
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:44,140
pays for,
I want to have a stint in marketing.

88
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:46,690
I want to work overseas for a period of
time.

89
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:49,840
I want to be mentored by Xyz.
I want to work on this big project.

90
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:54,340
I wanna,
I wanna I wanna and if by number 20 you

91
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:56,350
know,
typically your boss is going to say yes

92
00:04:56,351 --> 00:05:00,970
to something that can turn into
professional advancement or money down

93
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:04,120
the road.
And if he or she says no to all 20 I

94
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:06,490
think you've gotten a pretty clear
message there as well.
