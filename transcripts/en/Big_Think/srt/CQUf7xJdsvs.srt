1
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,780
Oh,
I don't know,

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,380
I can't answer a question like that.
You know,

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,210
you say you're optimistic and,
and,

4
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:17,130
uh,
you know,

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,480
the world is full of surprises.
God Lord knows,

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,090
I mean,
in 2001,

7
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:25,630
we thought we had no enemies world.
We were on a course.

8
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:29,140
The only problem seemed to be that the
stock market was a stock market.

9
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:30,640
Boom.
Seemed to be a little bit over.

10
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:32,680
And look what happened.
The history of the course,

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,250
the course of the world or the course of
this country at least change which

12
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:38,830
affected the course of the world.
And I don't think you can be too

13
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:43,831
sanguine about what the future holds.
Um,

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,630
well,
I think this age will be remembered as a

15
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:52,950
time in which America really struggled
with.

16
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:55,570
It's a world leadership.
Uh,

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,880
the United States,
uh,

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,930
went into a new phase of,
of,

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,460
of,
of,

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,520
uh,
of economic development as it's,

21
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,910
as it's,
as it's technologies became more

22
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:11,790
dominant.
Population changed from,

23
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,130
became an older population,
began to become an increasingly Latino

24
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:19,170
population.
Um,

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,370
I,
I don't have a,

26
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,350
a,
a quick adjective,

27
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,130
the age of,
of what,

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,013
uh,
whatever.

29
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,880
Uh,
but I think those are the dominant.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Nah.
