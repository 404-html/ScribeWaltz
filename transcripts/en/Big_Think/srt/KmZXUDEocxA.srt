1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,900
For over a 200 years,
the world has been set on fire by a

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,050
revolutionary message.
The message is that every individual

3
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:17,040
human being is a divine.
That all of us,

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,660
despite the constraints and humiliations
that's around us,

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,350
can share in a greater life and share
even in the attributes that we ascribe

6
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:31,860
to God.
Nevertheless,

7
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:36,861
the ordinary experience of human beings
remains an experience of belittlement.

8
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,930
This revolutionary message can only be
made real through a series of

9
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:50,940
transformations,
transformations in how we organize

10
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:55,941
society,
in how we live and in how we understand

11
00:00:56,251 --> 00:01:00,690
the world.
It is not enough to innovate in our

12
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:05,691
politics.
We must also innovate in our basic ideas

13
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,810
about who we are unless we innovate in
these ideas as well as in the

14
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:20,331
arrangements of society.
We cannot turn the message of our

15
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:26,721
divinity into a real experience.
Uh,

16
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:31,921
and thus the need today for a spiritual
revolution as well as for a social

17
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:34,290
transformation.

18
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,850
The focus of my thinking expressed in
this book,

19
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:43,851
the religion of the future lies
precisely there in the relation between

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,640
the transformation of personal
experience and the reorganization of

21
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:54,771
social life.
All the major religions and philosophies

22
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:02,070
that have exerted the greatest influence
over the last 2000 years,

23
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,080
uh,
arose from a series of religious

24
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:12,081
revolutions that took place around 2000
years ago.

25
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,970
And these religions took three main
directions,

26
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,540
one direction,
one my call overcoming the world.

27
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,051
And,
uh,

28
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:30,051
an example is Buddhism and the
philosophies that prevailed in ancient

29
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:34,470
India.
But it is a position to also represented

30
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,770
in modern Western thought.
For example,

31
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:42,180
by Schopenhauer.
According to this view,

32
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,570
all the distinctions and changes that
surround us are illusory.

33
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,960
Our task,
if we are to escape from suffering,

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,800
is to communicate with the hidden and
unified being a and to escape this

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,540
nightmare of the apparent world.

36
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,360
A second orientation,
uh,

37
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,720
when my called the humanization of the
world.

38
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,200
And it's teaches us that in a
meaningless world we can create meaning.

39
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,850
We can open a clearing space,
a social order that bears the imprint of

40
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:30,301
our humanity.
And in particular we can do so by

41
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,760
creating a society that conforms to a
model of what we owe to one another by

42
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:43,381
virtue of occupying certain roles.
The most important example of this

43
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:48,721
position in the history of religion and
philosophy has been confucianism.

44
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,500
The third direction is the direction
that I called him.

45
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,300
This book,
the religion of the future,

46
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,900
the struggle with the world.
It tells us that there is a trajectory

47
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,380
of ascent by which through changes in
how we live and in how we organize

48
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:15,841
society,
we can rise to a greater life and share

49
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:19,090
and the attributes that we ascribe to
God.

50
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,770
Uh,
and thus this ascent requires a

51
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:26,530
struggle.
And so I call it the struggle with the

52
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:28,120
world.
Now,

53
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:32,050
this third direction has had two main
phases in history,

54
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,920
a sacred face and a profane face.
The sacred face is represented in the

55
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,060
Semitic monotheisms,
Judaism,

56
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:48,061
Christianity and Islam,
and the profane face in the political

57
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:52,840
projects of liberalism,
socialism,

58
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:56,890
and democracy.
And in the project of personal

59
00:04:56,891 --> 00:05:00,910
liberation that has been represented by
romanticism,

60
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,120
both the original romantic movement and
the worldwide popular romantic culture.

61
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,540
The third direction teaches us that each
of us is bigger than he seems to be,

62
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,760
that each of us is called to share in
the greater life and to participate in

63
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:27,220
this divinity that we sometimes treat as
a separate entity.

64
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:30,430
They created the world and that
intervenes in history.

65
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,390
It is this third direction that has
exerted the greatest influence on

66
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:41,461
humanity over the last couple of
centuries in forming a series of

67
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:46,891
revolutionary projects in politics and
in culture that have set the whole world

68
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:52,360
on fire,
but all of these religions in each of

69
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:55,810
these three directions that I have just
described,

70
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,590
despite their amends differences,
share certain common characteristics.

71
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,230
One of these characteristics is that
they have represented,

72
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:11,990
as it were,
a kind of two sided ticket.

73
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,900
One side of the ticket is a license to
escape the world.

74
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,000
A second side of the ticket is an
invitation to change the world,

75
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,900
and this ambivalence has never been
fully resolved.

76
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:33,190
Another common characteristic of these
religions is that each of them in some

77
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:39,410
way,
denies or seeks to compensate for the

78
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:42,440
incorrigible flaws in the human
condition,

79
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:48,670
our mortality,
our groundlessness and rn insatiability.

80
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:56,470
Despite the fecundity of our experience,
despite this fundamental aspect of our

81
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:02,300
humanity,
which is that there is always more in us

82
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,980
than there is in all of the social and
conceptual worlds that we build and

83
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:09,770
inhabit.
We are all doomed to die.

84
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,160
We cannot look into the beginning and
end of time or understand the framework

85
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,370
of our existence.
Our presuppositions never reached rock

86
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:21,920
bottom.

87
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,920
The bottom is bottomless.
That's our groundlessness and all of us

88
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,370
human beings demand the unlimited from
the limited and project this demand for

89
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:40,040
the unlimited onto particular
inappropriate objects.

90
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,760
That's our insatiability.
All of these religions have attempted to

91
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:50,981
say that there is a solution and
antidote that we in fact will not die or

92
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,990
at least that there is some
compensation,

93
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,040
some compensation for these enigmas and
terrors of our existence and entirely

94
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:10,181
different moment in the history of
religion would begin if we accepted

95
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:15,671
these realities for what they are and no
longer attempted to deny them.

96
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,430
Given the enormous impact
of the third direction that I described,

97
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,720
the struggle with the world
on humanity over the last two centuries,

98
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,650
one my desk.
What is the core of its message and why

99
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:47,951
has this message been so seductive?
There are two ideas that that stand at

100
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:56,501
the center of this view of the world,
both on its religious side,

101
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,840
okay?

102
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,930
The Near Eastern religions of salvation,
Judaism,

103
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:07,530
Christianity and Islam.
And on it's profane side,

104
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,640
the projects of political and personal
liberation.

105
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,230
One set of ideas has to do with the
relation between the self and others.

106
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,250
The dominant view in the history of
world,

107
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:28,251
religion and philosophy and indeed in
modern academic moral philosophy is that

108
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:33,840
the fundamental problem of moral life is
selfishness.

109
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,520
And the solution to selfishness is a
principle of altruism.

110
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,430
Okay?

111
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:45,430
And this principle of altruism is to be
enforced by conformity to certain rules

112
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,970
that define our obligations to one
another.

113
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,620
And these rules are to be determined by
some conceptual method like cons,

114
00:09:57,451 --> 00:10:02,450
categorical imperative,
or Bentham's calculus of the greatest

115
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:07,451
happiness for the greatest number.
There is an attitude connected to those

116
00:10:10,641 --> 00:10:14,750
ideas.
The attitude is that we should try to

117
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:19,100
come to the end of our lives blameless
with clean hands,

118
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,360
having discharged our obligations to one
another on the green side of our book of

119
00:10:26,481 --> 00:10:27,470
moral accounts.

120
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:29,850
Yeah,

121
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,850
but that is not the view that stands at
the core of the moral beliefs of this

122
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:38,790
third tradition
there.

123
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:43,770
The view is that the basic problem of
our moral experience is not selfishness,

124
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,940
but rather a contradiction in the
conditions of personality and in our

125
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:55,290
relations to other people.
We need the others,

126
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,550
we make ourselves into human beings only
through connection,

127
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,750
but every connection is a threat.
Every connection jeopardizes our

128
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:08,160
freedom,
our autonomy,

129
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:12,360
our self construction,
and thus all of our relations to the

130
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:16,650
others are shadowed by an inescapable
ambivalence.

131
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:22,430
Sartre says the others are hell
describing aphoristic Lee,

132
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:26,490
this one side of this ambivalence.

133
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,070
Okay,

134
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:34,070
so what is then the solution that that
that lies at the center of this idea?

135
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,060
The solution is radical love in the
circle of intimacy and then some form of

136
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:49,671
cooperation of free and equal
cooperation outside the circle of

137
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:54,280
intimacy.
But this practical solution,

138
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:58,720
if one can call it that depends on an
imaginative capability,

139
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,720
the capacity to imagine the others,
to imagine their otherness.

140
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,280
And that is then the,
the teaching,

141
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,460
the real teaching that lives at the,
at the center of this tradition

142
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,330
for the ancients and for most of the
world religions and philosophies,

143
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,800
the highest ideal was the ideal of an
impersonal and impersonal and detached

144
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,530
benevolence from,
from on high,

145
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:32,830
from a distance,
implying no,

146
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,520
no risk on the part of,
of the [inaudible] of the benevolent

147
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:41,890
person.
But here now comes a different

148
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:46,120
conception that this impersonal
altruism,

149
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:51,150
this gift of benevolence from on high is
in fact not the center of our moral

150
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:53,620
experience.

151
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,200
That the highest form of moral
experience is reconciliation's Ian with

152
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:04,201
the other on the basis of equality and
at the price of a heightened

153
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:10,210
vulnerability.
Now there's a second set of ideas at the

154
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:14,890
center of this tradition.
And the second set of ideas has to do

155
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:19,891
with the relation between the structures
of social life

156
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,650
and the human spirit.
Now,

157
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,680
what I mean by spirit is the aspect of
our humanity that has to do with our

158
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:35,250
excess over all the regimes that we
create and inhabit.

159
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,970
Now,
there are two distortions that have had

160
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:44,530
a long career,
uh,

161
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,190
in the history of religious and
philosophical thinking.

162
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,580
One distortion might be called the heck
Ganean heresy.

163
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:56,581
It's the idea that there is a definitive
structure towards which history is

164
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:02,590
evolving and which will be the final
home of the human spirit.

165
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,090
And the other heresy,
one might call the Sartrean heresy or

166
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:10,690
the romantic heresy or the
existentialist heresy,

167
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:16,110
and it was prefigured by the mystics
within Judaism,

168
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:19,840
Christianity and Islam.
According to this heresy,

169
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,100
every structure is death to the spirit.
So the routines of marriage by contrast

170
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:34,891
to romantic love or the bureaucratic
apparatus of the state in opposition to

171
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:41,210
the crowd in the streets,
we can't get rid of the structures

172
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,160
definitively,
but we can momentarily rebel against

173
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:49,090
them.
And these interludes of rebellion or

174
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:51,650
then the time when we become most fully
human.

175
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:59,140
So it is a kind of despair.
It is a failure of our hope of changing

176
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:06,041
the relation of structured to spirit.
Now these two sets of ideas about the

177
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:14,691
self and others and spirit and structure
have never been adequately developed,

178
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:24,050
much less fully realized in political
and personal practice in the history of

179
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:26,820
our civilization.

180
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:28,710
Okay.

181
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:33,710
Both the political doctrines and the
religious traditions have lived in

182
00:15:34,531 --> 00:15:38,520
compromise with the existing forms of
social organization,

183
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,420
uh,
and with ethical attitudes that

184
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:47,421
contradict their impulse.
That is another reason for spiritual

185
00:15:48,451 --> 00:15:49,440
revolution.
Now,

186
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,290
if we were to take these ideas
seriously,

187
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:57,590
if we were to push them to the hilt,
if we were to ask how we should live

188
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:03,210
under the light of these ideas,
we would come to a completely different

189
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:06,640
conception,
a completely different conception of art

190
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:10,770
situation in the world and of the way to
organize society.

191
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,940
We have in fact in the history of our
culture,

192
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,490
in the history of the culture that has
been shaped by this third tradition,

193
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,980
the tradition of the struggle with the
world.

194
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,040
Only two completely developed images of
how to live.

195
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:38,130
One is the image of the sacrificial
altruist

196
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,280
who devotes himself to the others.
Without experiencing any intimate risk

197
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:52,790
or jeopardy.
And the other is the image of the

198
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:57,791
romantic adventure
who experience life as a perpetual

199
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:01,564
trial.

200
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,070
Yeah.

201
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,460
In the effort to deepen and affirm his
subjectivity.

202
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,700
Neither of these images is adequate as a
conception of how to live.

203
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,900
And the,
the absence of an alternative view

204
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,320
demonstrates once again,
the need for religious revolution.

205
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Now
one should begin by understanding the,

206
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,330
the points of departure and the,
the provocations for,

207
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,780
for such a,
such a spiritual change.

208
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,943
Yeah.

209
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,120
So one provocation
is the need no longer to deny the

210
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:50,510
incurable defects in the human,
our mortality,

211
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:54,690
our groundlessness and Dora
insatiability.

212
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:01,330
A second provocation is the importance
of not confusing our belittlement with

213
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:10,950
these in escapable defects in human
life,

214
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,880
we are belittled and humiliated all of
us in some way to some degree.

215
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,950
But this belittlement has a cure.
Unlike our mortality,

216
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:27,930
our groundlessness and our
insatiability.

217
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,010
The cure is for us to make ourselves
bigger,

218
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:37,550
to ascend to a higher life.
And that cure requires a reorientation

219
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:42,360
of the way we live and of the way in
which we organize society.

220
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,010
Okay.

221
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,970
And a third provocation to this
spiritual change,

222
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,420
uh,
is then the,

223
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:56,421
the,
the unwillingness to allow those ideas

224
00:18:57,091 --> 00:19:02,091
about self and others and spirit and
structure to be compromised and

225
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:07,551
circumvented as they have been in the
history of our religions and of our

226
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:09,510
societies.

227
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:12,650
Okay.

228
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,480
Uh,
so what does this mean?

229
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,600
What does this mean by way of a moral
orientation and what does it mean by way

230
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,250
of a political project?

231
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:24,783
Okay.

232
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,380
Let me illustrate what it means by way
of a moral orientation.

233
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,323
Bye.

234
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,260
Okay.

235
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,260
Referring to
how each of us is to respond to one of

236
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:48,530
the characteristic incidents in every
human life.

237
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,040
Yeah.

238
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,330
As we grow older,
each of us a,

239
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,920
a shell of compromise and routine begins
to form around us.

240
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,930
The self becomes rigidified in the
character.

241
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,620
The ancient Greeks said,
but character is fate.

242
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,490
Character is the rigidified form of the
self.

243
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,490
And the marriage of the character with a
social circumstance to which we are

244
00:20:18,491 --> 00:20:23,491
resigned then becomes a proxy for the
living self.

245
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,590
A mummy that begins to form around each
of us within which

246
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,810
each of us slowly dies.
Many small debts.

247
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,470
Uh,
what we must then do is to break the

248
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:43,340
mummy apart.

249
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,943
Okay.

250
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,530
Uh,
the bedroom live.

251
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,840
Uh,
and to become more God likes so that we

252
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:55,540
can live.
We do not live to become more godlike.

253
00:20:55,541 --> 00:21:00,541
We become more godlike to live.
And how were we to break the mummy

254
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:06,361
apart?
We cannot simply will ourselves

255
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,580
transformed,
but the will can project us into

256
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:17,581
situations in which we are unprotected,
in which we lose our habitual

257
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:23,110
protections in which we are forced to
become more vulnerable.

258
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,250
Okay.

259
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,410
And in this way,
uh,

260
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,190
awakened to,
to a greater life.

261
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:37,690
So the rebellion against mummification
is one of the many telling consequences

262
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:45,070
of such a reorientation to existence.
And what does it mean by way of a

263
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,510
political project?

264
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:49,660
Okay.

265
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,760
Uh,
for two centuries now,

266
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:59,260
ideological debate in the world has
taken the form of a contrast between

267
00:22:00,471 --> 00:22:04,670
what you might call shallow or quality
and shallow freedom,

268
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:12,590
the major political forces in the world
except the established institutions.

269
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,810
And then we think that the conservatives
are those who within that institutional

270
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:23,811
framework give priority to freedom.
And the progressive's are leftists are

271
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:30,350
those who give priority to equality,
but it is shallow equality against

272
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:35,100
shallow freedom because it's based on
this acceptance of the established

273
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:38,640
framework.
Now supposedly imagine that we can begin

274
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:43,641
to change this framework to innovate in
the institutions that define the market

275
00:22:44,191 --> 00:22:49,191
economy and democratic politics to
democratize the market economy and to

276
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:56,271
deepen democracy.
The method is the cumulative

277
00:22:57,871 --> 00:23:02,250
institutional transformation of society
and what is the objective?

278
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,210
The objective is not equality of outcome
or circumstance.

279
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,720
The objective is a greater life for the
ordinary man or a woman.

280
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,480
That's I would say deep freedom.
Who then are the progressive or

281
00:23:17,581 --> 00:23:20,610
revolutionaries today.
First,

282
00:23:20,611 --> 00:23:25,611
they are those who refuse to take the
established institutional structure for

283
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:28,980
granted.
And second,

284
00:23:28,981 --> 00:23:33,981
they are those who demand not simply to
sugarcoat those structures with some

285
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:40,371
compensatory redistribution,
but to bring the mass of ordinary men

286
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:48,621
and women to a greater of intensity of
capability and up scope so that they can

287
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:55,370
live eyes wide awake and share in these
attributes,

288
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:00,140
in these attributes of transcendence
that we ascribed to the divine.

289
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:06,490
And that then projects us into a world
of institutional proposals.

290
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,080
And institutional changes.
