1
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,990
Levies,
cough before who said that?

2
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,580
Her cooking in the process by which,
you know,

3
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:21,750
nature is stress home into culture and
the European civilization,

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,860
you know,
tetany you can go back and anything can

5
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:28,260
be filtered through the food itself.
I mean,

6
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,360
after apology,
history,

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,510
sociology,
even politic,

8
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:35,700
you know,
I mean you have political decision,

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,830
uh,
like uh,

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,351
the,
the,

11
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:41,490
the taxal Gabrielle in France in the
17th century for that tax on salt,

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,650
those are political decision who decide
where the food goes or other food is

13
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:51,060
going to be consumed or the embargo of
color in the 70s.

14
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:52,440
Again,
the grant out of Agu,

15
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:54,570
again,
a certain country of Europe,

16
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,080
this political decision as we see in
Africa,

17
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:01,050
an hour,
another part of the world will determine

18
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:04,930
where the food goes,
who die and new style and who die and

19
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:05,611
you leave,
you know.

20
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:08,010
So those are,
whether it's political,

21
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,510
religion,
you know,

22
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:10,760
food can be,
uh,

23
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,930
the Bible is an enormous,
uh,

24
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,300
so for,
for food or for,

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,180
for a eastery of food if you want,
you know,

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,430
so whether it's sociology,
there is no,

27
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,390
no part of social science which cannot
be really filtered through food.

28
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,310
And to a certain extent,
now it become a subject which is more

29
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,070
not only irrelevant but more respected.
I mean,

30
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:36,090
at Boston University we are offering now
a master of liberal arts with a

31
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:38,100
concentration in gastronomy.
I mean,

32
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:41,700
that would have been totally unthinkable
20,

33
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,490
30 years ago.
Even less than that when I came to

34
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:47,000
America and I work at the Perio
Trashcans,

35
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,150
you're the greatest French restaurant
here and was part of [inaudible] 89 and

36
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:53,670
[inaudible] 89 where the dishwasher,
the chef,

37
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:56,460
the cook to everyone,
we're in the same basket.

38
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,280
There was no difference.
And at that point,

39
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,190
you know,
I have to say that after,

40
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,870
uh,
after,

41
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:05,820
uh,
the pavilion year I worked for Howard

42
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,680
Johnson.
I work with a lot of black people,

43
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,180
black.
We understood the still,

44
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,730
that's what I wear the most into the
kitchen.

45
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,270
And now that,
uh,

46
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,590
the cooking had exploded and I'd become
very glamorous and inspired and even

47
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,610
genius,
like,

48
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:22,590
you know,
uh,

49
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,730
then,
uh,

50
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,380
you,
for some reason,

51
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:29,640
and I think it's a lost for the country,
don't have many black who are into

52
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:31,300
cooking now a couple,
you know,

53
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,380
but not many,
but many young American chef are in that

54
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:36,000
business now,
which as I say,

55
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:36,481
yeah,
and they go,

56
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:40,890
they would not even a,
that was considered a lou and inspire

57
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,520
type of a job,
which now it's exactly the opposite.

58
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,600
So we have the peregrination of the chef
is quite interesting because something

59
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:52,500
happened in the same way in the 17th,
18th century in France.

60
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,190
In fact,
there was a book written by [inaudible]

61
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,790
in the first half of the 18th century,
which is called a nouvelle cuisine for

62
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,200
the new French cooking.
So you see the nouvelle cuisine,

63
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:06,220
which erupted here in the 70s,
what already existing in the,

64
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:11,221
in the 1870 when it went down and up.
Why that Tan attacks again during,

65
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,610
uh,
during,

66
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:15,400
at the end of the 19th century,
at the time of the belly pork,

67
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:18,010
then it went down and up again.
So it's an interesting,

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,500
uh,
tried to look at the story of cooking

69
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,490
a great deal of the cooking and
discharging in baby even more so now,

70
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,410
uh,
there is good and there is bad certainly

71
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,900
thing like the food processor,
uh,

72
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,580
Seran wrap and uh,
and uh,

73
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,200
uh,
uh,

74
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:45,270
plastic or a rubber spatula after me.
Great Innovation of the last 30 years.

75
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,310
Uh,
but uh,

76
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,720
besides this,
you know,

77
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,950
we always manipulate food and uh,
our ancestor,

78
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,370
you know,
uh,

79
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,420
didn't have anything to eat and what we
call weak now was actually a wild the

80
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,090
while the weed,
you know,

81
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:08,920
which through a cross breeding and
challenging and manipulation.

82
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,470
We ended up now with this,
I mean not that long ago,

83
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:13,900
whenever the child,
you could not eat string bean before

84
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:18,790
string on one side and the other side,
which I tried to do and I had to do a

85
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,590
couple of,
uh,

86
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,400
you know,
pound or whatever that my mother wanted

87
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:25,120
me to do.

88
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,810
My brother and I tried to cut the end of
it with a scissor to which of course

89
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:32,770
those beans were absolutely or needle.
So now there is always been so many

90
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:36,260
potential to make it a better,
uh,

91
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,990
without the string or to make the animal
fatter or not as fat or more tender or

92
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:43,420
this and that.
So those manipulation of existing all

93
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:47,110
the time now bio engineered food,
it's something else.

94
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,080
You know,
[inaudible] we get into other area which

95
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,260
asked to be control.
I am not by a definition oposed to

96
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:58,720
anything because I think that to feed
the world,

97
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,440
we need that type of improvement,
but it has to be extremely controlled,

98
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,420
you know?
But without any question,

99
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:08,200
if you can do an egg,
which tastes like an egg for me are good

100
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:11,090
and an egg and it has half of the amount
of cholesterol,

101
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,370
why not?
You know,

102
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:14,620
it's,
you can have a tomato,

103
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,460
uh,
that because of so many progression

104
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,580
doesn't need to be sprayed with an
insecticide and pesticide or leasing

105
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,000
being resistant to this.
Why not that?

106
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:26,890
Maybe a plus.
But as I say,

107
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,220
you have to do it with circumspection.
You've really have to control it.
