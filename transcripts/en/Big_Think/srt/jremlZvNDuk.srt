1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,630
Some people ask the question of what
good is math?

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,170
What is the relationship between math
and physics?

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,480
Well,
sometimes math leads,

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,950
sometimes physics leads.
Sometimes they come together because of

5
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:16,230
course there's a use for the
mathematics.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,900
For example,
in the 16 hundreds,

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,520
Isaac Newton ask a simple question.
If an apple falls,

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,820
then does the moon also fall?
That is perhaps one of the greatest

9
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:33,831
questions ever asked by a member of
homosapiens since the 6 million years

10
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:39,000
since we parted ways with the apes.
If an apple falls,

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,350
does the moon also fall?
Isaac Newton said yes,

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,190
the moon falls because of the inverse
square law sodas an apple.

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,370
He had a unified theory of the heavens,
but he didn't have the mathematics to

14
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:55,710
solve the falling moon problem.
So what did he do?

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,390
He invented calculus.
So Calculus is a direct consequence of

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,510
solving the falling moon problem.
In fact,

17
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:05,430
when you learn calculus for the first
time,

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,280
what is the first thing you do it?

19
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,290
What's the first thing you do with
calculus?

20
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,610
You calculate the motion of falling
bodies,

21
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,780
which is exactly how Newton calculated
the falling moon,

22
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,020
which opened up celestial mechanics.
So here's a situation where math and

23
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:23,480
physics were almost co-joined,
like,

24
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:27,750
like Siamese twins born together for a
very practical question,

25
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,420
how do you calculate the motion of
celestial bodies?

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,400
Then here comes Einstein asking a
different question and that is what is

27
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:40,401
the nature and origin of gravity?
Einstein said that gravity is nothing

28
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:44,910
but the byproduct of curves space.
So why am I sitting in this chair?

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,660
A normal person would say,
I'm sitting in this chair because

30
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:52,530
gravity pulls me to the ground.
But Einstein said,

31
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:52,851
no,
no,

32
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:53,610
no,
no.

33
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,650
There's no such thing as gravitational
pull.

34
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,390
The earth has curved this space over my
head and around my body.

35
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,110
So space is pushing me into my chair.

36
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,680
So to summarize Einstein's theory,
gravity does not pull space pushes,

37
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,710
but you see the pushing of the fabric of
space and time requires differential

38
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:20,250
calculus.
That is the language of curved surfaces,

39
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:23,760
differential calculus which you learned
in fourth year of Calculus.

40
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,850
So again,
here's a situation where math and

41
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:31,230
physics were very closely combined,
but this time math came first.

42
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,380
The theory of curved surfaces came
first.

43
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,770
Einstein took that theory of curved
surfaces and then imported it into into

44
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,890
a physics.
Now we have string theory.

45
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,230
It turns out that 100 years ago,
math and physics parted ways.

46
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,350
In fact,
when Einstein proposed special

47
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:53,940
relativity in 19 Oh,
five,

48
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,180
that was also around the time of the
birth of topology,

49
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,820
the typology of hyper dimensional
objects,

50
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,070
spheres in 10,
11,

51
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,150
12,
26,

52
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:09,100
whatever dimension you want.
So physics and mathematics parted ways.

53
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,380
Math went into hyperspace and
mathematicians said to themselves,

54
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,243
ah Ha.

55
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,580
Finally we have found an area of
mathematics that has no physical

56
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,570
application whatsoever.
Mathematicians pride themselves as being

57
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:27,910
useless.
They love being useless.

58
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,730
It's a.
it's a badge of courage being useless,

59
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,680
and they said the most useless thing of
all is a theory of differential topology

60
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:37,510
and higher dimensions.
Well,

61
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:41,470
physics plotted along for many decades.
We worked out atomic bombs.

62
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,140
We worked out stars,
we worked out laser beams,

63
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,380
but recently we discovered string theory
and string theory exists in 10 and 11

64
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:52,780
dimensional hyperspace.
Not only that,

65
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,350
but these dimensions are super.
They're super symmetric,

66
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,800
a new kind of numbers that mathematician
has never talked about.

67
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,040
Evolve within string theory,
that's what we call it,

68
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,430
super string theory.
While the mathematicians were floored,

69
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,940
they were shocked because all of a
sudden out of physics came new

70
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,820
mathematics,
super numbers,

71
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,480
super topology,
super tiff,

72
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,510
differential geometry.
All of a sudden we had supersymmetric

73
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:27,511
theories coming out of physics that then
revolutionized mathematics,

74
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,560
and so the goal of physics we believe is
to find an equation,

75
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:36,790
perhaps no more than one inch long,
which will allow us to unify all the

76
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:41,791
forces of nature and allow us to read
the mind of God and what is the key to

77
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:42,640
that one?

78
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,070
Didn't you?
Equation Super Cemetery,

79
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,420
a cemetery that comes out of physics,
not mathematics and has shocked the

80
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:53,800
world of mathematics,
but you see all this as pure mathematics

81
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,870
and so the final resolution could be
that God is a mathematician,

82
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,870
and when you read the mind of God,
we actually have a candidate for the

83
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,330
mind of God.
The mind of God,

84
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:12,331
we believe is cosmic music,
the music of strings resonating through

85
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:17,980
11 dimensional hyperspace.
That is the mind of God.
