1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,370
Watching children in early adolescence
and in adolescence is,

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,880
is always eternally heartbreaking for
adults.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,510
There was a great article in the Times
magazine about Christmas maybe 20 years

4
00:00:14,511 --> 00:00:17,390
ago,
that the power of the Christmas mystery

5
00:00:17,391 --> 00:00:22,391
is when you look at a child the same way
that you know in the story that the

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,070
Virgin Mary looked at her,
looked at her new son,

7
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:28,640
the Christ child,
and thought simultaneously this child

8
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:30,770
might save the world and he's going to
die.

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,610
Right?
So this like huge amount of hope we have

10
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:37,310
for our children and this terror that
they're going to die.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,520
If my mother looked at me at 13 if she
read my diaries about how eagerly I want

12
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:48,200
it to be popular,
it would sound very like someone cording

13
00:00:48,201 --> 00:00:50,150
likes on instagram.
You know,

14
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,180
I knew if my outfit didn't go over well
and I knew the way that a 13 year old

15
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:59,510
might not post a foe might pull down a
photograph if it on Instagram,

16
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:02,030
if it doesn't get enough likes not to
wear that again.

17
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,310
Right.
Or I decided not to wear that again

18
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:06,890
because being liked was the most
important thing in the world to me at

19
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:10,820
that age and for a reason.
You want to know how you're going to

20
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,370
play in the world.
You want to know how to be in the world,

21
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:16,970
how does show up in the world and you're
testing and learning what works for you.

22
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,190
And by the way,
it's heartbreaking.

23
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,370
It's heartbreaking when people don't
like you or invite you to a party.

24
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,170
And similarly,
it's heartbreaking,

25
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,590
you know?
Now when you don't get the response you

26
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:31,820
crave online or you get a response
that's out of proportion to what you

27
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:33,290
did.
But you know,

28
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:36,440
taking the risk of,
let's just take the simple,

29
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,790
you know,
instagram brings up fears of narcissism

30
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,860
because we're in heyday of self
portraiture,

31
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,650
which we've been in before.
There have been other times where

32
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:46,670
people,
you know,

33
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,510
sat for portraits or painted themselves
and you know,

34
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:54,560
van Gogh's self portrait is rarely
regarded as an it work of narcissism.

35
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,280
But let's say that we have this popular
form that as these self portraits,

36
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,860
staging them,
taking the photograph,

37
00:02:00,861 --> 00:02:03,500
taking many photographs,
choosing the right photograph,

38
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,930
cropping it,
coloring it,

39
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,620
and then distributing it immediately to,
you know,

40
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:14,621
this giant gallery space.
And then like every artist trying to see

41
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:16,760
who buys it,
trying to see who's interested in it,

42
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:20,060
trying to see if it sells and trying to
see what kind of commentary they get on

43
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:21,020
it.
Um,

44
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,900
you know a lot of people who post self
portraits,

45
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,980
and this was true in the early days of
Youtube with musicians are actually

46
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,230
looking for,
in some cases for critical feedback.

47
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,380
You know,
remember the hot or not thing that where

48
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:36,740
you put photographs were posted and you
could decide I like,

49
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,220
I don't like,
um,

50
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,000
that you know,
which also plays on the right and left

51
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:44,030
swipe of,
of tinder is sometimes what recording.

52
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,800
Like does this work?
Does this work?

53
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:48,380
I'm in Beta right now.
You know it.

54
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:50,690
Do I talk loud enough?
Do I talk too loud?

55
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,570
Do you know that credible self
consciousness of like,

56
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:57,230
are my bangs a little too short?
Are My eyes big enough or,

57
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,980
you know,
how can I inhabit this body I'm in and

58
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:03,150
be an fit.
The exigencies of social life fit the

59
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,080
exigencies of a party or a workspace or
by the way opt out of it.

60
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,470
You know,
there are plenty of,

61
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,530
of of kids who are dialing back and we
see among millennials are return to flip

62
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:17,940
phones or to abstinence from computers,
um,

63
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,360
from,
from the Internet.

64
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,100
Um,
and I think that's very interesting.

65
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,020
The last thing I'll say,
you know,

66
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:25,120
when you talk about teaching my own
kids,

67
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,970
I feel very strongly that we can't adopt
a true love waits abstinence program

68
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:31,810
about screens.

69
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,170
The idea is not to teach your kids,
you know,

70
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,470
never go to parties,
never live in social space,

71
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,880
avoid other people.
We like learning to live in digital

72
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:46,210
space is not unlike learning to live in
social space.

73
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,600
And it's what kids want help doing.
You know,

74
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:53,230
I remember my mother teaching me this
incredibly subtle social lesson,

75
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,800
which is when you're describing a party
that you went to,

76
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,750
but another friend didn't get invited
to,

77
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,530
don't say the party was terrible.
Don't say they missed nothing.

78
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:05,020
Don't say it was awful.
It's disingenuous.

79
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,470
It's not.
It's not fair to the host and it's

80
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,870
condescending to the person you're
talking to.

81
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,300
Anything that you were left out of was
awful.

82
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,160
Right?
So I,

83
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,500
you know,
I metabolize that lesson.

84
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:19,810
I remember it was a sleep over and I was
eight years old.

85
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,450
Those are the kind of lessons you teach
your kids online.

86
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,660
Are you going to be the kind of person
that posts a topless shot on instagram?

87
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,730
Well,
that has certain requirements that's

88
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:30,820
going to have certain consequences.
Let's go through what those consequences

89
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:32,260
are.
If you,

90
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,960
if you,
are you going to be posted in all caps?

91
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,420
Say,
are you gonna use twitter a lot or you

92
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:39,850
can use pinterest a lot.
If you use pinterest,

93
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:42,310
what are you going to use it for?
What is the buy button about?

94
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,070
Well,
how much are you using this as to tee up

95
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:47,740
purchases and what are you going to do
with that debt?

96
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,270
How are you going to afford those
things?

97
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,270
What are you going to do with the part
of the Internet that shows your credit

98
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:56,270
card debt?
Say these are experiences that coach

99
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,030
ought to be embraced with confidence,
uh,

100
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,260
to be embraced with confidence,
not as though the party,

101
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,210
the people,
the city streets,

102
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:06,070
the whatever are simply terrifying.

103
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,440
And the only thing to do is lock your
door against them.

104
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,930
But to show up with,
you know,

105
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,283
uh,
you know,

106
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,180
the women I know got advice from their
mother that's too much black eyeliner,

107
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,520
you know,
that's too much hair dye,

108
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,780
you know,
getting,

109
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:21,550
uh,
I remember when I pierced my ear the

110
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:23,500
second time,
my mother said that's prelude to getting

111
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:25,570
a tattoo.
I didn't agree with her.

112
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,010
Right.
I didn't agree with her.

113
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:31,120
I decided to that I would do it anyway
and where a secondary thing in that ear

114
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,670
and that was okay.
But there are certain things that you

115
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:35,920
say to your kid like,
you know,

116
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,410
my son just chose his,
his uh,

117
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,150
his g-mail name.
Right.

118
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,130
And he decided to use his whole name,
like his first middle and last name

119
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:46,630
because it showed up,
you know,

120
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,700
no one else had it.
And that is a lot of letters to type in.

121
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,960
He's the got along name to type into
Gmail all this time and I asked him,

122
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,510
you may have lifetime of signing into
things with your Gmail address.

123
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,310
Do you really want to be typing all
those letters?

124
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,790
He said yes.
When he chose his avatar for Google,

125
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,180
he took a million pictures of himself.
He's 10 years old and he opted to have

126
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:12,650
one of those executive pictures leaning
way back for lots of like authority and

127
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:14,840
Alpha maleness.
And I asked him,

128
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,930
you're 10 years old,
don't you want to be like a little cuter

129
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:19,370
and more childlike?
And he said,

130
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,830
absolutely not.
I'm going with the executive picture.

131
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,930
And that was a good strategic decision
for him.

132
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:26,180
I think a good artistic decision for
him,

133
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,270
you know,
empowering our kids to think like

134
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,730
artists,
to think like writers to think like

135
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:34,610
novelists.
They are creating an Avatar online.

136
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,120
You don't want to be like,
you don't necessarily want to be some

137
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:42,200
Pollyanna Avatar who only posts great
things about her life.

138
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,530
Maybe you do or do you show up all the
time?

139
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:49,520
Vaguebooking and,
and writing sad sack posts and talking,

140
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,550
you know,
really vulnerably like a memoirist

141
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,690
maybe,
you know,

142
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:55,520
maybe,
but those are choices that have

143
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:59,390
consequences.
And that's at that level of detail.

144
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,850
Cause by the way,
we all do it in our lives with facebook

145
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:05,390
anyway.
That level of detail you teach kids.
