1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,470
One of the great things that I,
that I love about what I do is we get to

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,070
take on some of the biggest challenges
in global health and global development.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,730
And one of those challenges is water,
sanitation and hygiene.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,960
Um,
everybody needs clean water and you

5
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:20,970
know,
uh,

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,660
to quote the book,
everybody poops.

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,160
And,
uh,

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,630
dealing with this in a clean and
sanitary way is really important for

9
00:00:28,631 --> 00:00:31,870
quality of life and it's also really
important for health and getting rid of

10
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:36,310
certain diseases.
One of the biggest challenges over the

11
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,610
last couple of years,
uh,

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,480
a really fun technological challenges
has been the reinvent the toilet

13
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:41,990
project.
Uh,

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,840
the basic theme of this was looking at
are there new solutions,

15
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,020
21st century solutions to sanitation,
echoing what we saw in a telephone and

16
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:57,190
communication systems where a lot of
countries completely skipped over

17
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,250
building a,
a big network of landlines and

18
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:02,650
traditional phones and went straight to
cell phones.

19
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,690
Uh,
the question was,

20
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:09,691
could we come up with the equivalent
technology that would jump over building

21
00:01:10,631 --> 00:01:14,170
out sewer networks in giant water,
expensive water treatment plants,

22
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,320
and jump immediately to non-network
sanitation.

23
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,300
And it turns out that new approaches are
possible using mechanical engineering

24
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:24,820
and chemical engineering approaches.
Uh,

25
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:29,650
there's actually a lot of free energy in
the waste that can be used to process

26
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:31,330
itself if,
uh,

27
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,930
the machine to do it is designed
correctly and you can actually do this

28
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:38,650
in a fairly cost effective way.
So the reinvent the toilet challenge was

29
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:39,730
kicked off,
uh,

30
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:41,410
about five years ago,
uh,

31
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,340
in order to,
uh,

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,410
get universities,
uh,

33
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,980
different companies,
design firms and so on to actually think

34
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:52,981
about this and put a 21st century
innovation applied to the problem of a

35
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:58,060
human sanitation.
And it's been remarkably,

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,590
uh,
uh,

37
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,190
cool and successful so far to see the
different approaches that have come up.

38
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,310
There was one team of a lot of hurts
fellows that,

39
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,450
uh,
started,

40
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,790
uh,
working on figuring out new ways to do

41
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,820
use pyrolysis and other approaches for
using electrolysis for drying.

42
00:02:16,631 --> 00:02:20,260
And combusting one group is running a
steam engine off of,

43
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,780
uh,
human waste as the input stream and

44
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:26,090
we're a community would use to have,
uh,

45
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,530
10 tons of waste the day.
Now all of a sudden a,

46
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,770
it runs a,
a steam engine that generates 150

47
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:37,510
kilowatts of electricity and puts out
10,000 to 20,000 liters a day of potable

48
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:40,870
water.
So this is just really exciting to see

49
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:43,690
what innovation can do,
what new technologies can do,

50
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,050
and actually,
uh,

51
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,150
taking on some of these really big
challenges in saying what would be a

52
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:54,151
really definitive technological solution
to this that actually solves the problem

53
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:57,880
in a way that we would never have
imagined trying 25 or 30 years ago.
