1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,660
Well,
I think one of the key lessons or

2
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:11,661
reminders is how intertwined main street
and Wall Street really is.

3
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:14,550
When we were,
uh,

4
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:18,020
working with the federal government,
um,

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,300
during the Aig crisis,
one of my biggest concerns and that very

6
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:28,341
rapid collapse of aig was how many
companies in this country could have

7
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:33,710
liquidity choked out and they didn't,
they,

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,391
they,
it,

9
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:38,130
it was coming too quickly and the
implications across the country were

10
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:41,010
profound.
And so I think one,

11
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:44,710
recognizing how important it is to,
um,

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,320
have a,
a safe yet robust financial system if we

13
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:52,890
hope to have financial growth is a very
important,

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,023
um,
uh,

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,180
reminder.
And that in fact,

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,110
if you don't have a healthy financial
system,

17
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:05,340
it's hard to,
to fund the growth that small,

18
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:09,060
medium,
large companies and individuals need and

19
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:10,770
deserve.
So I think,

20
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:13,350
again,
it's the relationship between main

21
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:17,400
street and Wall Street is important.
Curbing excesses is clearly important

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,380
and I think putting us on a stable base
so we can have that consistent growth in

23
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:25,110
the industry to support capitalism.
Otherwise,

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,160
again,
um,

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,390
we can't have the growth that,
that the country needs to do.

26
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,940
You can have the growth economy needs.

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,560
I'm generally an optimist.
I think I've seen so many cycles in my

28
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:48,021
23 years in the business.
I started in August of 1987 only to see

29
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:53,820
the market have one of the biggest
crashes ever in October of 87.

30
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,750
And seeing a number of other cycles and
after each one,

31
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,990
lessons or lessons are learned.
And I think that the pendulum often

32
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:06,840
swings too far one way before it comes
back the other way.

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,880
But there's a,
an important learning and growth

34
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,330
opportunity that comes out of,
um,

35
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,070
each one of these situations.
This is clearly more profound than what

36
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:21,960
we've seen in many,
many decades.

37
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:25,950
And so one would hope that we're
building the right foundation to grow

38
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:26,760
from the space.
