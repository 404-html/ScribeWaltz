1
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,610
In order to transform a company into a
sustainable organization in terms of

2
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:18,500
both commitment and performance.
Leaders have to approach their job,

3
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:20,980
the CEO's,
the top management of key people,

4
00:00:20,981 --> 00:00:24,590
of business units and so on,
have to approach their job in a way

5
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:25,790
that,
uh,

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,350
that engages the organization in a
learning process.

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,791
Uh,
that is,

8
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:36,680
they see the problem of organization
performance as a problem of learning

9
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:39,440
both for the work for themselves and for
the organization.

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,390
Uh,
these leaders,

11
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:45,170
first of all,
connect authentically with people.

12
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,390
How do you,
how do they connect authentically with

13
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:50,810
people by being much more revealing
about themselves?

14
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,410
Uh,
so a CEO took over a company,

15
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,520
uh,
uh,

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,433
uh,
uh,

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,160
uh,
a restaurant company,

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,540
uh,
uh,

19
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,920
first management meeting spoke not only
about what the firm needed to do,

20
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:08,330
but about where he was coming from and
its own life experience had to do a lot

21
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:10,760
with his father and the values that his
father had.

22
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,100
Uh,
revealing those things about himself and

23
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:18,101
who he or she might be is a critical
part of engaging people in an authentic

24
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:23,210
way.
The second element of leadership is that

25
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:28,211
these leaders have to have the will to
an to essentially change the system,

26
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,530
change and transform the company around
a,

27
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,710
around the kind of philosophy and values
I've talked about.

28
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,500
Uh,
and around the business idea that's

29
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:42,620
going to drive the business model,
that's going to drive the organization

30
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,500
to better performance.
They have to have a clear vision of

31
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:47,510
that.
And they develop that vision on their

32
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:48,111
own.
And,

33
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:49,150
and,
and,

34
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,300
and uh,
they bring it,

35
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:53,270
bring a lot of that with them.
But as far as the business aspects,

36
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:55,940
they have to figure that out when they
get into the firm.

37
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:01,220
But they have to have the will to
essentially articulated and push for it.

38
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,680
Now,
if I were to stop here,

39
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,940
you could also say,
well,

40
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:08,660
that can lead to autocratic management,
which is not what high commitment,

41
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:09,980
high performance firms are.

42
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,640
Uh,
because the next dimension of effective

43
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:15,290
leadership,
that high commitment,

44
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:18,920
high performance leaders have is the
willingness to inquire,

45
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,240
the willingness to state boldly what
they want and what they think they need

46
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:24,950
to do and what the firm ought to be
doing.

47
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,630
And why.
But also the willingness to inquire from

48
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:33,470
their own senior team,
from the organization as a whole,

49
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:37,370
from people at various levels in the
organization about whether the direction

50
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:41,010
makes sense,
whether what they see as what,

51
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,000
what people in the organization she as
they as the strengths of the

52
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:46,400
organization,
but also what they see as the barriers

53
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,170
to achieving sustainable performance.
And uh,

54
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,370
and that enables them to learn the truth
about the character of the company and

55
00:02:57,681 --> 00:03:00,490
how it's functioning to the create
sustainability.

56
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:03,610
You have to learn about yourself as a
leader and not necessarily you as a

57
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:05,560
person only,
but also your ideas,

58
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,980
your strategic ideas about what you're
trying to do and whether in a business

59
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,210
policies you promote that.

60
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,080
Does that make sense?
And if you're not able to up,

61
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,730
if you're not able to,
uh,

62
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,650
obtain that feedback,
you are likely to not be able to get off

63
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,240
a path that you may have to get off of
to,

64
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,420
to sustain the performance,
uh,

65
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:29,170
over long periods of time.
The ability to inquire and obtain

66
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:33,640
feedback and,
and be vulnerable to obtain feedback is

67
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:36,160
a critical characteristic of,
of high commitment,

68
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:37,690
high performance leaders.
Uh,

69
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:42,691
this has been described in many ways,
in the less operational way as people

70
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,800
leave.
These leaders are humble.

71
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,560
They have humility.
They don't assume they are doing it

72
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,300
themselves.
They involve others.

73
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,330
They ask questions,
they try to work on a problem solving.

74
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:52,720
Basically.
