1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,980
Well,
there's a vast number to choose from and

2
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:15,981
perhaps it's worth emphasizing the
arbitrary nature of the selection

3
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:21,591
process if once thinking in terms of
billions of past human beings,

4
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:26,450
it's extraordinary,
uh,

5
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,080
how hard it is to make a selection and
generally the selection has been made

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,190
for you,
but previous historians by posterity,

7
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,430
by the contemporaries who built statues
or books about a famous men and women.

8
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,860
And so often one finds oneself writing
about people who are already a great or

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,560
evil men or women before you even show
up.

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,070
But I find myself recently in,
in the book called the war of the world

11
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:59,640
writing considerable amount about
Winston Churchill,

12
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:02,760
Joseph Stalin at all fit Franklin
Roosevelt,

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,400
the stars,
heroes and villains of,

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,230
of the 20th century.
But part of what I do is to try to,

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,350
to write the history of non political
institutions,

16
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:16,800
like firms to look at the history of,
of capitalism,

17
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:20,040
the history of business,
and to give equal billing to

18
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:23,070
entrepreneurs as well as to generals and
politicians.

19
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:26,610
Because I think the history of modernity
actually requires that balance to be

20
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:29,100
struck.
And then you get to know slightly less

21
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,900
familiar figures.
The first hero of any book I ever wrote

22
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,250
was a German Jewish banker named Max
Viral called Warburg.

23
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,620
Uh,
who turned into the hero of my doctoral

24
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,900
dissertation rather,
to my own surprise,

25
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,350
simply because as I rummaged around in
archives and Humberg trying to

26
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:51,330
understand why Germany had imploded
economically in the 1920s,

27
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,110
he kept cropping up and emerged as the
central,

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,420
a hero of,
of,

29
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,950
of my first book paper and Darren,

30
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,530
oh.
