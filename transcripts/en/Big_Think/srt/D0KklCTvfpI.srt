1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,470
Well think of it.
This is the way we thought about it.

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,480
Where is the most defamation rooted in
our society?

3
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:15,230
Still?
What,

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,080
what aspects of society is there still a
lot of homophobia,

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,400
um,
against,

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,230
uh,
against the lgbt community?

7
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:23,870
And you look at the world of sports and
we have a long way to go.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,020
And so we created the sports media
program to spark,

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,800
start working with media professionals
that cover the sports world.

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,610
When incidents come up that where
there's either been an active defamation

11
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:37,730
or there's an opportunity to educate
people through sports media,

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,870
we want to have that kind of influenced
the same way we have the influence and

13
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:44,000
the entertainment world and television
shows and films and so forth.

14
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,500
So the sports media program is working
without athletes on the college level.

15
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,510
Um,
some closeted athletes on the

16
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:54,020
professional level still and really
creating the opportunity to begin some

17
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:54,950
of those dialogues.

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,900
And then we're also talking to a
professional broadcast journalists,

19
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,700
people who are sports casters,
people who are writing stories about the

20
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:07,520
sports world to see if we can have more
fair,

21
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,670
accurate and inclusive representation of
lgbt athletes.

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,250
Whether they're on whatever level
they're in,

23
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:16,670
but certainly there's a lot of young
athletes who want to be able to compete.

24
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,980
Um,
maybe someday as professionals,

25
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:23,150
certainly maybe in the Olympics and they
want to know if they can be out.

26
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:24,200
He's like,
it's a great story.

27
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:27,730
We got an email not long ago from a
mother who is saying,

28
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,770
I'm,
my son is an amazing high school

29
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:31,950
athlete.
Um,

30
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,540
he's out and I want him to be able to go
to a college or university where he can

31
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:39,530
be out as an athlete and be safe.
Where should he go?

32
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,680
You know,
where can,

33
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,680
where can he look too?
This is his sport.

34
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:44,600
This is what he wants to do.
This is coming from a parent,

35
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,630
which is just tremendous.
So we shared some information with that

36
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:49,880
person,
connected them with some people at some

37
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:53,120
universities that are very supportive of
the lgbt community.

38
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,660
And someday we'll be able to tell that
that young person's story,

39
00:01:56,661 --> 00:01:58,430
when he's very successful as an athlete.
