1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,120
In the good old times,
people learned how to read and to write.

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,590
That's no longer sufficient in the high
tech 21st century.

3
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:18,591
We also need to know how to deal with
risk and uncertainty and that is what I

4
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:22,500
mean with risk savvy.
Here's a simple example.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,070
You hear on the where's the report could
there's a 30% chance of rain tomorrow,

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,910
30% chains of what now?
I live in Berlin and most Belinda's

7
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,210
believe that it means that it will rain
in 30% of the time.

8
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,900
That is seven to eight hours as a think.
It will rain in 30% of the region.

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,930
Most New Yorkers belief,
that's all nonsense.

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,190
It means it will rain on 30% of the days
for rich.

11
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,840
This prediction has been made that is
most likely not at all.

12
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,250
Many psychologists think that people
can't learn how to deal with risk,

13
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,290
but in this case it's the experts do
meteorologists.

14
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,740
We have not learned how to communicate
risk in an understandable way.

15
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:24,741
That is to say to what class?
The 30% refers time or region or days.

16
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,190
And if you have some imagination you can
think of what other classes.

17
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:34,140
For instance,
one woman in New York said,

18
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,470
I know what 30% means,
three meteorologist think it rains and

19
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:43,740
seven not now getting soaked isn't minor
risk,

20
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,810
but I'll be risk savvy when it comes to
more important things.

21
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,890
For instance,
20 year olds drive,

22
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,460
we still cell phone glued to their ears
not realizing that the decrees,

23
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,250
their reaction time to that of a 70 year
old or many Americans,

24
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,690
about 20% believe that they are in the
top 1% income group and as many believed

25
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,730
it will be soon be there or take health.
So about an estimated 1 million children

26
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,940
get every year unnecessary computed
tomography.

27
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,290
CT scans
unnecessary because they're not really

28
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:36,210
clinically indicated,
which is not just a waste of time but

29
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:41,211
also danger to the kids because a ct
scan can have the radiation of a hundred

30
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:49,221
chest x rays and may lead in a small
number of these kids later to cancer.

31
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,810
We deal everyday with risks but we
haven't learned how to understand them.

32
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,060
And the problem is not simple in the
human mind,

33
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,450
but also in experts who is a,
don't know what the risks are or don't

34
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,980
know how to communicate them or in other
areas,

35
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,010
like if it's about finance or health,
have interests other than yours.

36
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,970
So the key message you stays,
everyone can learn to deal with risks.

37
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,180
In that case,
everyone can learn to ask the question,

38
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,810
probability of what.
And second,

39
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,320
if you believe that are safe by young
delegating the responsibility of your

40
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:43,501
Wilson and health to experts,
then you may be disappointed because

41
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:50,680
many experts
do not know how to communicate

42
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:53,790
probabilities or,
uh,

43
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,370
tried to protect themselves against you
as in health care as a potential

44
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,760
plaintiff.
So you have to think yourself.

45
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,770
And that's the key message.
