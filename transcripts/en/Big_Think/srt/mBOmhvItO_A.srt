1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,700
Joanne,
writing poetry as being down on your

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:09,390
hands and knees with the language.
Um,

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,960
you know,
if someone carbs a swans and animals out

4
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:17,420
of soap and that person loves soap.
And if you right,

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,380
you love the language.
So it's an opportunity.

6
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:26,000
Writing a poem is an opportunity to get
as close to the language has pretty much

7
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:27,390
you can get.
Um,

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,070
the other joy because it is a pleasure
and I,

9
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:34,760
I wouldn't,
I have no high mission that drives me to

10
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:38,510
write poetry.
It is a very hedonistic activity and I

11
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:40,100
get,
I write it for pleasure,

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,810
I go there to get pleasure and uh,
and if possible to give pleasure.

13
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,490
Um,
so,

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,590
uh,
one of the key pleasures is,

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,690
and most poets would,
would,

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,390
would agree with this,
it starting out not knowing where you're

17
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:58,391
going and finding a way to get there.
So the poem becomes

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,960
not a whole expression of something you
think or feel,

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,300
but it becomes a journey through itself
to an ending.

20
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,430
And that ending is a unforeseeable.
And in fact,

21
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:17,270
the ending is something that the poem is
busy creating.

22
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,370
It's almost as if the poem is the only
way to access that.

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,130
That particular ending.
Uh,

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,320
I have a poem called questions about
angels.

25
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,650
And at the end of that poem,
uh,

26
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,750
an angel appears and I didn't know she
existed before I write that wrote that

27
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:38,480
poem.
And I guess strictly speaking she

28
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:42,170
didn't.
So I think of that poem is simply the

29
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:44,360
job of that poem is to bring her into
being,

30
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:47,600
to bring its own ending into being.
When you're not writing,

31
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,510
there's an anxiety about whether you
will right again,

32
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,010
um,
of all the kinds of writers,

33
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,110
well,
at least compared to playwrights and

34
00:01:57,111 --> 00:02:01,610
novelists,
poets return to the blank page more

35
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:03,710
frequently.
Um,

36
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,500
and you know,
a novel can take you six months or five

37
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,480
years to write,
but a poem,

38
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,940
you know,
can get done in an afternoon or a couple

39
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:12,560
of days,
um,

40
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,360
and then you're back to zero and you
have to restart from nothing.

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,850
And at that point,
the question comes up.

42
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,200
I mean,
can you restart?

43
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,280
Can you boot yourself up again,
so to speak?

44
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,170
Or was that ed?
Um,

45
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,370
so that,
that is probably the main anxiety I

46
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:35,170
think that goes with poetry writing is,
um,

47
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,740
heavier exposure to the blank page or
regular,

48
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,260
uh,
encounters with blankness.

49
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,190
I just go poem by poem.
I don't have an overarching,

50
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,430
you know,
sense of a book as a project.

51
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,320
I probably have a manuscript.
I do have a manuscript of foams that is

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,280
just about ready and I'm just,
you don't want to send it out too early.

53
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,160
It probably needs maybe two or three at
the most,

54
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,350
um,
really strong,

55
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,030
good poems and that it will be ready.
And so I'm just interested in getting

56
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:15,031
that out of the house and maybe starting
upon this afternoon or our next

57
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,460
Wednesday,
you know?

58
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,320
Oh,
great.
