1
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,240
Basically,
there are a lot of people who say,

2
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,700
Oh,
we need new inventions,

3
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:19,570
new breakthrough technologies for plugin
vehicles to be practical.

4
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:25,210
And our position from the start has been
w they are way better than good enough

5
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:27,400
to get started right now.
The,

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,480
the batteries we have and the motors and
the electronics we have are able to make

7
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:35,770
great vehicles.
Uh,

8
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,920
as you know,
it'd be great to have better batteries

9
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:42,520
someday as they come in.
That's icing on the cake right now.

10
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,390
There's a good economics case for a
battery technology.

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,100
And then on the other side,
every alternative fuel needs a new

12
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:54,430
infrastructure or new scientific
breakthroughs except this one.

13
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,840
Uh,
you need new fueling infrastructure for

14
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:01,360
a alternative fuels,
for biofuels.

15
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,260
You need to create more for natural
guests.

16
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:07,480
The same thing,
but one of our big,

17
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,770
uh,
one of our big gimmicks we had when we

18
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:16,420
started Kalkaska as we walked around
with this and we said every alternative

19
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:20,710
fuel vehicle needs a new in new
infrastructure except this,

20
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,410
the plugin card,
this is connects you to today's

21
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:27,610
infrastructure.
A one 20 volt plug can power most cars.

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,310
And when you get to a truck or a big
vehicle,

23
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,500
you're not,
it's going to take too long on one 20.

24
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:34,840
So you're going to need the dryer plug
in your garage,

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,230
a two 40 and you can do that.
But the point is we have the

26
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,780
infrastructure now,
the fueling infrastructure for cars.

27
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,910
When cal cars was founded and we did our
first conversions,

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,150
uh,
we put it all into the public domain and

29
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:53,700
we enabled individuals to do their own
conversions.

30
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,410
At that point it was a strategic goal to
get enough plugin hybrids around the

31
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:01,470
country to show what was possible.
Since then,

32
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:06,650
a small ecosystem of companies has grown
up to do conversions of hybrids of

33
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:11,280
Prius's and that's a mock at around a
million vehicles perhaps.

34
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,020
So those companies are moving ahead.
Some of them have gotten all the federal

35
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:18,740
approvals and crash testing and so forth
and they,

36
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:20,490
uh,
they have a business opportunity.

37
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,950
We think there's a much larger business
opportunity for companies to convert

38
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,700
some of the 250 million vehicles that
are not hybrids,

39
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,260
the big gas guzzlers and some of the
that was in the u s and 900 million in

40
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:36,780
the world.
And a lot of companies will do that

41
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,130
where the federal government comes in
and where local governments come in is

42
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:42,600
in helping us get there quicker.

43
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,820
So right now,
for instance,

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,820
if you buy a new plug in vehicle in the
next year or two,

45
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,330
you'll get a $7,500 tax credit from the
federal government,

46
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,850
which will help a lot to bring down the
price.

47
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,250
Uh,
there are other places in the world

48
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:58,410
which have even higher incentives in
that,

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,800
and there are places that are using tax
policy and so forth because the reason

50
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:07,990
why we have that credit is not simply
the practical reason of helping these

51
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:11,830
companies get started and so forth.
It's because the buyer doesn't get a lot

52
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:15,430
of the social benefits that are driving
a,

53
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,060
I guess,
zipper or a plugin hybrid brings.

54
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,650
It brings some benefits to the whole
society and reducing energy insecurity

55
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:28,651
and and emissions and so forth.
So you incentivize the buyer for higher

56
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,240
first costs for those vehicles.
Now,

57
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,030
at this point,
within a few years,

58
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:35,580
it's very possible that the,
uh,

59
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,600
uh,
it'll be cheaper to actually buy a

60
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:42,160
plugin car than a regular car,
and it'll be a no brainer at that point

61
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,520
when we get to that point,
the incentives will be less necessary.
