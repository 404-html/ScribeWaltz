1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,260
One of the classic definitions of
mindfulness is that it helps us not

2
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,750
cling to what's pleasant and not condemn
what is unpleasant.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,250
So an example would be if you're driving
in New York City and someone cuts you

4
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:30,620
off,
you know,

5
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:35,621
that's unpleasant and one would
instinctively have an angry response.

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,890
But that's happening all the time.
And if you have an angry response too

7
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:42,290
often,
then you become a nightmare yourself.

8
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,890
So what mindfulness is teaching is that
the stimulus,

9
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,420
which is someone cutting you off,
is different.

10
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,450
It's distinct from your emotional
reaction to that thing.

11
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,870
So someone could cut you off,
you could feel the anger,

12
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:06,920
but you don't have to act on the anger.
So instead of being driven by your

13
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:11,510
reactions,
there's a little bit of a of room where

14
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:13,850
you can choose to be a different kind of
person.

15
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,930
So mindfulness basically helps us
tolerate,

16
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,940
uh,
the,

17
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,810
uh,
the aspects of the external world and

18
00:01:23,811 --> 00:01:27,050
the internal world that otherwise are
hard to face.

19
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,460
There are basically two kinds of
meditation.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,340
One,
which is a concentration practice.

21
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,900
You focus your attention on a neutral
sensation,

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,200
like the feeling of the breath coming in
and out of the nostrils or uh,

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,870
like the repetition of a sound or what's
called a mantra.

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,270
And every time the mind wanders,
whenever you notice that it's wandered,

25
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,960
that might be five minutes,
10 minutes later when you're lost in

26
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:02,660
thought.
But at a certain point you realize,

27
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,810
oh wait,
I'm not watching the breath anymore.

28
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,420
Then you bring your mind back to the
breath.

29
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,960
That's called a concentration or a one
point in practice.

30
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,790
And that's the,
that's the,

31
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,550
uh,
beginning level of mindfulness.

32
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,490
When you really start practicing
mindfulness,

33
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,650
instead of bringing the mind back every
time to a central object,

34
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,070
you let the attention go wherever the
mind goes.

35
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,320
So instead of paying attention just to
the breath or the mantra,

36
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,940
you pay attention to sounds.
You pay attention to thoughts,

37
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,290
you pay attention to feelings,
you pay attention to memories.

38
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,320
You pay attention to worries,
to anxieties,

39
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:48,080
to anger,
to joy.

40
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:52,070
You pay attention to whatever passes
through your mind moment to moment.

41
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,590
And then what you start to see is that
oh,

42
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,730
everything is changing all the time.
And uh,

43
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,920
uh,
you learn to pay attention more to

44
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:01,750
process then to content.

45
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,170
It's really only in the past 50,
60 years that the medical establishment

46
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,350
has been exposed at all to what
mindfulness is.

47
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,020
And for 20,
30 of those years,

48
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:22,490
it was like just a new age thing.
It was on the periphery and only through

49
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:23,670
the work of,
uh,

50
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,090
a couple of people like John Kabat Zinn,
uh,

51
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,770
has mindfulness come into the medical
establishment.

52
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:33,230
And there are a lot of studies that are
being done now,

53
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,590
um,
that are showing the benefit of

54
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:41,090
mindfulness for all kinds of,
uh,

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,080
conditions.
And some old colleagues of mine,

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,800
uh,
have done some very good work showing

57
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:55,270
that the steady practice of mindfulness
light up areas of the brain that have to

58
00:03:56,091 --> 00:04:01,091
do with modulating emotional reactivity.
Um,

59
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:07,170
so I think there's beginning evidence
that the,

60
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,260
the brain is plastic more plastic than
we initially thought.

61
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,960
And that the,
you know,

62
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,900
what,
what you feed into the brain actually

63
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:22,340
changes the architecture of the brain so
that it's possible to promote,

64
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,700
to develop the areas of the brain that
are there,

65
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,530
uh,
for kindness,

66
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,900
you know,
for altruistic feeling.

67
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,230
Uh,
and for the regulation of difficult

68
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:33,860
emotions.
