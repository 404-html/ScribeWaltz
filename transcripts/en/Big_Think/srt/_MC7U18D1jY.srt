1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,043
Mm,

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,270
so why should someone who's in the
business of getting someone's attention,

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,120
why should somebody who runs a business
that's all about getting attention?

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,170
Why should they switch to being in the
business of helping people?

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,640
Well,
for one,

6
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:21,510
it's going to be hard to do that until
consumers actually demand that that's

7
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:24,150
what they want.
We all need to recognize this as

8
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:26,850
citizens of humanity.
It just being human,

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,020
that this world that's constantly
fighting to grab our attention doesn't

10
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:33,110
serve any of us.
It's,

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,600
it's polluting our inner and our social
lives.

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,340
And once we recognize that that's the.
We don't want that as consumers that

13
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:45,120
will enable businesses to follow
consumer demand and say we want to

14
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:48,630
provide something whose goals are
entirely in alignment with your goals,

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,070
where we measure our success in terms of
the net positive benefits that we

16
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:57,930
delivered in people's lives and we
charged more like a subscription model

17
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:01,950
or a payment model rather than
advertising where we have an infinite

18
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:04,500
appetite in stealing as much of your
attention as possible.

19
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,590
So you know,
when we check our phones 150 times a

20
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:09,180
day,
which is the average,

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,200
are those 150 conscious moments where
we're sitting here and then we think and

22
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:20,610
then we choose,
now I'm going to check my phone or does

23
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:24,390
it just happen to us?
And I think one thing that that we don't

24
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:26,940
talk about with the attention economy,
what's different about the attention

25
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:30,810
economy versus a,
a normal marketing product,

26
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:35,811
goods economy is that in the regular
economy people make a conscious choice

27
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,800
theoretically about the products that
they choose to buy or the places I

28
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,950
choose to go to,
I think get into a car and go there.

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,780
In the attention economy,
I don't choose where my intention goes.

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,960
I choose kind of in the moments in
between,

31
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,690
but a lot of my intention can be
steered.

32
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,730
This is what magicians do.
I mean they,

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,780
they do a trick by steering your
attention by focusing your attention

34
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,614
over here.

35
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,150
And so what's different about the
attention economy is we have less choice

36
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:09,660
about where our attention goes.
It can be steered and manipulated much

37
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:13,860
more easily than the conscious choice
buying economy when I'm choosing to buy

38
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,480
a good.
So.

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,330
So yeah.
So why are we checking our phones 150

40
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:20,470
times a day?
Why is this so compelling?

41
00:02:20,471 --> 00:02:23,160
Well,
it's because at any given moment in life

42
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,240
when,
when I'm left with the uncomfort of

43
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:30,420
being with myself where reality gets
just a little bit boring for just a

44
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:31,740
moment.
If you have just a break,

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,470
you,
you walk into a cafe and there's a line

46
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,240
before you order.
What do we do?

47
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:39,780
Why do we pull out our phone in that
moment in a world where this has

48
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:41,420
increasingly,
you know,

49
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,500
gives you access to anything that you
want at any given moment or the ability

50
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:50,370
to get back to those 10 emails or the
ability to watch that video you've been

51
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:51,204
meaning to watch.

52
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,150
Why would you not turn to your phone in
that free moment?

53
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,590
So we have to reckon with a world in
which next door to my current to moment

54
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:02,380
experience of reality.
There's this immediately sweeter,

55
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:06,220
better choice.
And if that's true for every human being

56
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:08,440
walking around,
we just put a better choice on life's

57
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:12,900
menu in your pocket that at any moment
you can switch to suddenly the world is

58
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:16,210
gonna look a lot like it does today
where everyone is down on their phones.

59
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,750
Right?
And it's the point isn't that suddenly

60
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,870
we're just distracted or something like
that,

61
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:23,350
that we have to really get intimate
with.

62
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,220
Why is this happening?
And the reason it's happening is because

63
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:32,221
it's more compelling than simply being
with the discomfort of reality as it is,

64
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,460
which is going to force us to ask some
really deep questions with,

65
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,580
with ourselves of if we were to not live
that way,

66
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,830
if we were to live,
uh,

67
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,650
not looking at our phone in a free
moment in time,

68
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,060
would we be willing to deal with
sometimes being a little bit

69
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,730
uncomfortable or being a little bit
bored?

70
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,250
Um,
and when we make that choice,

71
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:56,320
we don't just make that alone because,
you know,

72
00:03:56,321 --> 00:04:00,580
imagine that person who meditates in the
morning and suddenly says,

73
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:01,121
you know,
I really,

74
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:02,860
I'm not going to look at my phone today.
And so they,

75
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,620
they,
they land in that line in the cafe and

76
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:08,230
they don't look at their phone and
they're kind of looking around smiling,

77
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:10,510
but suddenly everyone around them is
still on their phone.

78
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,780
And what real realize realizes is that,
you know,

79
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,960
it's sort of like a weekend isn't just
for us,

80
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:20,200
it's about being in a weekend together.
If we don't look at our phone,

81
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:22,480
we don't just want to not look at our
phone by ourselves.

82
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,660
We'd want to actually be able to connect
together and more connecting with other

83
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:29,050
people.
It makes realities as sweet actually as

84
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,800
the things that our phone provides
because the whole point is like when,

85
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,960
when you're in connection with someone
else in your,

86
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,960
that actually is more compelling than
being with our phones.

87
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,550
But when you're just by yourself sorting
for what's going to be the most

88
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:45,910
stimulating or productive or
entertaining way for me to be right now,

89
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,480
oftentimes our phone will beat out other
choices that are appearing before us.

90
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,520
Um,
and it's only when we're with other

91
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:56,320
people that,
uh,

92
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,270
and we're,
we're in connection or conversation with

93
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:01,810
someone else that,
that actually is better than often.

94
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,940
You know,
these individual choices we can get on a

95
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:05,950
phone because we actually do desire
connection.

96
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:06,210
Wouldn't.
