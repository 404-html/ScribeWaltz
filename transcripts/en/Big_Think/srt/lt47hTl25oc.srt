1
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,241
Well,
I,

2
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,030
I always love working with which
scorsese because,

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,000
um,
he,

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,620
he had the confidence to know,
unlike a lot of directors,

5
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:19,010
he had the confidence,
you know exactly what he wanted and he

6
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:19,431
said,
okay,

7
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:20,750
you're the writer,
give me this.

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,350
And he didn't fret over it.
He just went off and,

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,450
you know,
set up his shots and,

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,850
you know,
you sort of trusted me to deliver the

11
00:00:28,851 --> 00:00:33,230
goods.
A lot of guys are like so anxious that

12
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:35,720
they never know what they want and you
get caught in the middle.

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,600
Um,
you get into power plays between actors

14
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:40,630
and directors and you know,
you fit,

15
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:40,970
you,
you know,

16
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,130
you feel like a secretary.
What a dog collar on.

17
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,630
Um,
but I never,

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,340
you know,
which Scorsese,

19
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:47,480
you know,
it was like,

20
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:51,170
he just knew exactly what he wanted and
you know,

21
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:52,760
it was a breeze.
I mean,

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,250
it's never easy,
but it was relatively,

23
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:56,000
it was a breeze.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Other people I worked with that I really
liked is a David Simon and,

25
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,770
and the crew around the wire.
Uh,

26
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:07,610
the only reason to do that show other
than you sure don't do it for the money.

27
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:09,030
I mean,
you open up the envelope and um,

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,220
you know,
moths fly out.

29
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,083
But,
um,

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,090
you do it cause it's the wire and it
was,

31
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,140
it seemed like a,
like a group of peers,

32
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,550
although it wasn't cause Simon was to
create her,

33
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:20,810
he and Ed Burns,
you know,

34
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:21,371
they,
they,

35
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:23,000
they were the writer,
producer,

36
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,110
creator is always the guy that rewrites
everything and is in control.

37
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,530
But given that there was none of the
Games,

38
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,350
uh,
it was me and Pelicano Pelecanos and

39
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:36,080
Lehane and,
and Ed Burns and David Simon.

40
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,120
And I felt like when we were all
together,

41
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,050
you know,
there was,

42
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,060
there was a,
a sobriety,

43
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,620
you know,
of purpose,

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,850
um,
and,

45
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,080
and a mutual sympathy and respect,
you know,

46
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,100
for each other's work that I rarely find
in,

47
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:53,030
in,
in,

48
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,320
in group situations like movie making.
And it was just a great show.

49
00:01:58,321 --> 00:01:59,690
I'm,
although I frankly,

50
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:01,700
it was so hard,
I didn't even understand my own scripts

51
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:02,840
most of the time,
but,

52
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,703
you know,
I did,

53
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,600
you know,
did what I was told,

54
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,650
you know,
and then some.

55
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,550
And,
uh,

56
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,710
I was just really proud to be part of
that,

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,270
you know.
