1
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:09,703
I think that,
um,

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,470
it's more of a great philosophy that you
have a Moira,

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,580
you have a lot in life,
and aristotle taught us that you take

4
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:22,530
your Moyer,
you kind of realize where it is.

5
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,140
Can you try to fill it up as much as you
can?

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,440
Aristotle also taught a very good lesson
that people like naturally there's

7
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:35,880
something inherent in human beings about
wanting to perfect whatever you do,

8
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,170
you need tries to understand why this
is.

9
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:41,660
But yeah,
it doesn't get added.

10
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,060
But he says it's clear.
People like to perfect what they do.

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,690
Then the second is far more even more
insightful.

12
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,970
And that is people like to perfect
complicated subjects more than easy

13
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:58,080
subjects.
So in a very simple analogy,

14
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,560
no one becomes a fanatic on checkers.
I've never seen somebody say,

15
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,990
oh my God,
I love checkers.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,830
I just think of checkers all the time.

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,810
It's a simple game.
Uh,

18
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:09,380
but chess,
you find lots of fanatics in chess,

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,550
their whole life revolves around chest.
Why?

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,450
Because just as complicated and so they
to perfect,

21
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:20,451
it takes a lot of effort.
So I think that there is a great

22
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:25,551
attraction to taking something hard like
Shakespeare or like understanding the

23
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:31,761
arts and try to perfect that rather than
takes up the simple and perfecting that.

24
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,110
That's why a musicians are so stretched
because,

25
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:37,441
uh,
you know,

26
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:41,610
it's very hard to be a very good mood.
Just anybody in the arts is stress a

27
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:44,400
lot.
Stretch a lot because it's complicated

28
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,700
and that's,
aristotle would tell you that's what

29
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:52,220
makes it so much fun and it makes it
very frustrating because a,

30
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:53,910
there's not much margin for error there.
