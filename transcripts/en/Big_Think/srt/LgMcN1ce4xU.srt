1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,160
Born
and growing up in New York City,

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,080
automatically you have first a little
uberous

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,850
by definition because there's nothing
beyond New York City.

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,910
Though I have traveled the world and
there are great cities,

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,240
but I think most important,
the diversity of New York City,

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,000
the diversity of people,
diversity of ideas,

7
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:29,350
diversity of foods,
music experiences automatically forces a

8
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:31,850
certain amount of your boundaries,
uh,

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,100
to come down because you meet,
meet people and have these experiences

10
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,070
that are so different from whatever
experiences you grew up.

11
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:43,330
I grew up in a traditional Jewish home,
wound up going to Columbia University,

12
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:45,580
and,
and literally all of a sudden,

13
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:49,110
an entire world was there.
I was living on 116th street and,

14
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,990
and there were more types of food.
One could have in a five,

15
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:54,610
six,
seven block radius,

16
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:57,910
then one could have in whole other
cities in the world.

17
00:00:57,911 --> 00:01:00,580
And so yet alone,
all the different kinds of people in the

18
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:03,130
different sounds and,
and the different smells.

19
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:05,560
And,
and I think what that does is it opens

20
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:05,920
up,

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,030
um,
but that,

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:15,840
yeah.
