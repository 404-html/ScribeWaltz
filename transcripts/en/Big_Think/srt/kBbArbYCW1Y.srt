1
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,580
I don't think it's had a dramatic
effect.

2
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:12,670
I think one of the effects,
which is not probably a great effect,

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,020
is that a lot of the new shows now try
to show that they have a sense of humor

4
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,620
and uh,
and um,

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,680
um,
that,

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,790
that they can be rascals as well or make
fun of themselves.

7
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,010
And I'm,
uh,

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,260
I'm not sure how I,
I,

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,010
I'm,
I'm not sure how valuable that is.

10
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:38,011
I think probably their anchors on these
shows are less likely to say things

11
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:44,380
without thinking if,
if they're concerned that they might be

12
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:46,750
made fun of on a show like the daily
show.

13
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:51,030
So that can't be bad.
I don't think it's made the gun gun shy

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,710
in a way that the,
that the audience isn't being served.

15
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:54,910
I mean,
um,

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,440
you know,
um,

17
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,383
I think,
um,

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,130
I think,
I think that the,

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,480
the,
the sad reality remains that they are,

20
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,120
that they respond to what they think
their audience wants.

21
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:15,340
And this current campaign is so riveting
that they're sort of on their best

22
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,070
behavior right now.
And I actually think that the,

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,040
that,
the,

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,560
that,
the,

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,860
that the cable news nats,
which are sort of flawed because they

26
00:01:23,861 --> 00:01:28,861
feel that they need to keep filling all
this time least it's being filled with,

27
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,290
with more substantive politics than
usual.
