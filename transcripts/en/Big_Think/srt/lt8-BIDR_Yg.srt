00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,300
Hi there,
I'm Jason Guts and you're listening to

2
00:00:07,301 --> 00:00:09,400

00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,800
Since 2008 big thing has been bringing
you big ideas in small concentrated

4
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:24,240
doses from some of the most creative
thinkers and doers around on.

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,790
Think again,
we take ourselves out of our comfort

6
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,340
zone,
surprising my guests and me,

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,990
your host with unexpected conversation
starters from our interview archives,

8
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:37,290
ideas that we didn't necessarily come
here prepared to discuss.

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,040
I'm very,
very happy to be here today with William

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,270

He created the role of Captain James,
t dot kirk on the original star Trek and

12
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:50,340

his portrayal of denny crane on the

13
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:54,690

15
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:01,770

who's been on this show and his newest

17
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,910
book,
zero g coauthored with Jeff Rovin is a

18
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:12,750
science fiction terrorism thriller set
in the Year Twenty 50.

19
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,340
It begins with an unnaturally powerful
tsunami that destroys most of the coast

20
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:20,940
of Japan and follows FBI field agent
Samuel Lord,

21
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,240
as he attempts to unravel the mystery.
Welcome to think again,

22
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:26,340
William.
That was a long introduction,

23
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:27,900
but very,
very well done.

24
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,260
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about your book,

25
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:35,550
but before we do that,
as I am a longtime Shakespeare Fan,

26
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:37,440
and I know you started out in
Shakespeare,

27
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,420
I wanted to come out of left field and
ask you whether you have a favorite

28
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,160
character,
play,

29
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,560
speech,
etc. Of shakespeare,

30
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,600
any,
any favorite thing of shakespeare.

31
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:51,810
I wOndered if we could Start there.
Favorite shakespeare character,

32
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,720
character play speech moment.
Anything?

33
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,640
Yes.
I have to point at a henry,

34
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:03,330
the fifth in which I understudied.
Christopher plummer,

35
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,150
who was playing henry fifth at stratford
many,

36
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:10,110
many years ago,
and in repertory is especially this

37
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,040
repertory.
At stratford you open a play and then

38
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:19,041
the next morning after you've opened,
you start rehearsals on new play and

39
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:23,940
then you do that for four weeks and then
open that and maybe a third and a fourth

40
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,860
so that the understudy rehearsals would
be delayed until you finished opening

41
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:32,640
new plays.
And about the third or fourth day I waS

42
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:37,050
asked to go on stage as they understood
it because chris was ill for a moment

43
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,780
and they asked me to go on and I had
never,

44
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,700
not only had,
I never rehearsed it,

45
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,150
I'd never said the words out loud,
but I had been drilling myself for some

46
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:50,280
reason and I speculate about this and my
one man show.

47
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,290
Why did I drill those words so,
so emphatically?

48
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,920
Because nobody ever goes on for an under
say no.

49
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,740
I've never been in an understudy.
A relationship where somebody went on

50
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:06,820
for me or I went on for somebody else
except in this one instance in which I

51
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:11,140
had never spoken the words out loud.
And then I went on stage in front of

52
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:13,720
2,500 people in and critics and all
that.

53
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:14,360
And uh,

54
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,670
so how did it feel?
Was it terrifying?

55
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:17,504
How did it

56
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,070
no know I was on a wave.
I,

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,760
I don't recall being terrified.
I recall I've looked at pictures of

58
00:03:25,761 --> 00:03:30,761
laird hamilton coming down to a way that
a 70 foot wave and I've got to think

59
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:35,890
that he had the same feeling.
And so I did this,

60
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,180
this thing pursuing you and your writing
and you can't lose your confidence

61
00:03:41,241 --> 00:03:43,730
because the moment you doubt your,
it's over.

62
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,880
So it.
So that's how,

63
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,400
that's how it is For you.
You feel that you must,

64
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,790
you must keep self doubt completely at
bay because I've often thought that,

65
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,781
uh,
you know,

66
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:54,930
for me anyway,
you can feel the self doubt and then

67
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:56,130
say,
oh,

68
00:03:56,131 --> 00:03:57,120
well,
you know,

69
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,270
there that is and still do your thing,
you know,

70
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:01,280
and just having a

71
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,230
that's good.
If you can say,

72
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,090
oh well there'S no doubt there's fear
and there is a dread and there,

73
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,450
oh look at that.
There's hysteria coming monday.

74
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,630
And then,
you know,

75
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,790
somehow deal with it and press on.
For me in life,

76
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,390
denial is perfect.
Denied.

77
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,150
Denied the experience.
Denial.

78
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,330
Oh,
that hasn't happened.

79
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,230
Is not going to happen,
I don't even want to think about it and

80
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:29,770
I'll die before.
Uh,

81
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:33,150
I experienced that and eventually it all
goes away anyway,

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,330
so I'm half jewish and so for all the
semi or fully.

83
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,920
But go ahead,
jason,

84
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:41,230
you should be in denial about that.
Well,

85
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:45,970
I was going say that woody allen gave us
all permission to sort of recognize the

86
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:49,870
terror and the anxiety and simply to
move forward and turn it into something

87
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,860
I don't know if not sexy,
at least acceptable in his case.

88
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,690
Turn it into a career.
Yeah.

89
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,640
So you've had an amazingly varied
career.

90
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,610
You're your best known to the general
public probably for the star trek films,

91
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:06,720
but you've been doing a million things
and,

92
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,070
and you've been writing for years and
years now.

93
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,410
How did writing enter the picture for
you were,

94
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,750
you know,
at what point did you decide to start

95
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,210
taking writing seriously,
if that's the right way to put it?

96
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,070
Well,
uh,

97
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,040
I,
uh,

98
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,000
the written word is where everything
begins and ends.

99
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,570
I've always known that.
So I've always written in one manner or

100
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:25,800
another.
I love poetry.

101
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:28,230
I love the usage of words,
uh,

102
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,560
in fact,
when I was just starting out,

103
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:33,900
I wrote some television,
half our players,

104
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,840
which the canadian broadcasting
corporation,

105
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:41,841
the cbc in Canada,
which was the equivalent of say nbc here

106
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,960
bought and I cast one of those shows a
girl and eventually married her.

107
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:53,391
She becAme the mother of my children,
so I've been writing a long time,

108
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,180
but the breath more measured and works
started when there was a strike by some

109
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,070
unions while I was making a film.
And there was nothing I could do.

110
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:10,040
I had to sit around and wait for the
strike to be over.

111
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,420
So I started writing.
I gave myself the premise of a policeman

112
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:17,120
in space.
I had done a police series.

113
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,320
So,
uh,

114
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,820
I began at 10 books and uh,
it became 10 books a year,

115
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,500
a year series and a movie.

116
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,360
So I noticed,
I saw,

117
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,590
you know,
looking through your work.

118
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:30,280
And by the way,
I really love those,

119
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,620
those albums that you did with ben folds
there.

120
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:34,530
They're really cool.

121
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,450
That album was called,
has been.

122
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,210
It was.
I really look at that.

123
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,310
Wonderful.
And um,

124
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,820
I,
I,

125
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,690
I'm just noticing that in both the
writing and in the music,

126
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,570
you're collaborating and you seem to
enjoy collaborating.

127
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:50,000
I mean acting is the collaborative art
as well.

128
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:54,890
Do you find that you prefer to create
with other people as opposed to a in

129
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:55,640
solitude?

130
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,640
So science fiction is,
it's a strange form Your imagining a

131
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:08,381
plot and people,
but it's also littered with scientific

132
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,650
possibilities.
EIther imaginative possibilities are

133
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:16,550
possibilities that exist in the
laboratory that may come into existence

134
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,520
years from now and you have to be
acquainted with all that.

135
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,080
And it's a very esoteric
acquaintanceship to know science

136
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:27,380
intimately to be able to write about it.
No science individually.

137
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,730
Jeff rovin is tHis wonderful writer who
has that knowledge.

138
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:35,600
So doing the two of us,
me working on the more emotional aspects

139
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:39,170
and the plot and him working on the
scientific aspects.

140
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,380
We've created a lovely novel filled with
scientific possibilities.

141
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,050
Both that takes the plot along or that
are added like little diamonds that that

142
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:55,631
you'll read and may even smile at the
new political unions that couldn't

143
00:07:55,971 --> 00:08:00,920
possibly be right in our year,
but 50 years might very well come to be.

144
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,150
That sort of thing is great fun.

145
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,960
What are so in the new buck in zero g?
I mean I think I gave enough of an

146
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:10,450
overview of the plot.
I don't want to give too much away.

147
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:15,220
It's definitely a fun and interesting
thriller set.

148
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:20,221
In 2025,
what are some of your favorite moments

149
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,570
or ideas in the book?
Anything you'd want to kind of highlight

150
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:26,920
for people who haven't read it?

151
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,920
Well,
we have a character there.

152
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,700
We took from the present day publiCity
about people who feel they've been born

153
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:40,680
in the wrong body,
so we named that character ed zilla and

154
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,510
adzilla instead of going for an
operation,

155
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:47,080
a changing his or her sex is able to do
it by.

156
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:52,081
We'll that's totally an imaginative
concept taken from the ongoing

157
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:56,520
controversies that are in our day and
age,

158
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,820
but someday in the future there'll be a
medical implant whereby by an act of

159
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:03,540
will you can change your sex.

160
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,890
Yeah,
I found that really fascinating.

161
00:09:05,891 --> 00:09:08,470
First of all,
adzilla his parents,

162
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,440
uh,
I guess genetically altered her either

163
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:13,560
at birth or pre-birth.
Um,

164
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,110
and so that raises some interesting
ethical issues.

165
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,680
You know,
like about w w we are going to come to a

166
00:09:20,681 --> 00:09:24,980
point no doubt in the near future when
parents actually may have some stuff

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,210
control,
I think with enough instrumentation that

168
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,660
could look into that aspect of,
uh,

169
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:36,640
of an unborn baby.
So since we're on the verge and in fact

170
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:39,430
did not on the verge,
we're genetically altering,

171
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,850
but we're on the verge of genetically
altering almost anything easily.

172
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,310
Why wouldn't it be possible to go inside
even just a concept and alter the

173
00:09:51,431 --> 00:09:56,431
genetic structure of the unborn child?
It is happening when they see diseases

174
00:09:56,771 --> 00:10:01,090
that are abnormal or why couldn't you do
almost anything?

175
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,500
Well,
let me ask you this,

176
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,270
were,
you know,

177
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:08,270
if you were in a position to sort of
start all over and have kids and you had

178
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,820
sort of unlimited genetic alteration
power,

179
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,170
what would you take advantage of it?
Or what would the limitS be for you

180
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:18,004
personally?

181
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,310
Well,
you see what you're addressing.

182
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:25,311
there is a real moral problem.
How much do you altered genetically?

183
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,050
That goes for food as well.
By the way,

184
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,470
gmos are apparently healthy.
They're allowing us to feed 7 billion

185
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:38,580
people that shouldn't be on earth in the
first place by being able to feed seven

186
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:42,390
and maybe 10 to 11 billion people in the
very near future.

187
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,830
We like lemmings have destroyed our
environment and we're only going to

188
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:51,150
destroy it further.
So we've genetically altered crops to

189
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:55,440
avoid disease.
So the limitation is not only on what

190
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:59,340
food is,
but how many people we can procreate and

191
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:02,730
chinese tried to do it by limiting it to
one person,

192
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:05,850
but that didn't work because now their
culture,

193
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,080
uh,
didn't want girls.

194
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:11,850
They wanted boys and saw a whole human
aspect to something that was going to be

195
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:15,610
really good.
A scientific breakthrough that offered

196
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:19,320
to humanity the hope of feeding
everybody and having no,

197
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,680
no starvation morphs into more people
and more pollution and a the end of the

198
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:30,000
world,
the end of the world is nigh because of

199
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:33,720
the number of people on earth.
And how do you reduce the number of

200
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:38,610
people on earth without getting into
mass murder,

201
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:42,950
are altering the baby in vitro did not
being able to have any children.

202
00:11:42,951 --> 00:11:47,951
I mean the morality that that this
brings up is the springboard for so many

203
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,180
science fiction novels and that's what
we're.

204
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,130
That's what I'm.
I'm

205
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,261
indeed.
Well,

206
00:11:54,261 --> 00:11:58,880
and you're in zero g there is that we
used to science station on the moon.

207
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,470
There are,
you know,

208
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,170
fairly complex space station.
So I mean that,

209
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,900
you know,
at least elon musk with his,

210
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:06,980
you know,
space x,

211
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,941
mars,
mars,

212
00:12:07,941 --> 00:12:11,030
mission,
mission seems to think that that may be

213
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,220
one viable solution as well.

214
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,900
There was no way that human beings can
colonize anyplace else other than than

215
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:26,230
earth because the time it takes to reach
an earth like planet that has the

216
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,200
proximity to its star and many of the
values here,

217
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:37,550
which includes this thin skin of
atmosphere and the temperature range on

218
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:41,090
the oxygen,
the oxygen proportion came about by

219
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:43,880
evolution.
When chlorophyl stArted,

220
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:47,960
I mean you go back,
one thing bringS on another so that by

221
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,820
evolving here on earth,
we human beings have arrived at our

222
00:12:52,821 --> 00:12:57,821
reptilian brain and our complex forehead
that evolved over millions of years.

223
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,910
How the heck you can't live underground
on mars,

224
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,860
even if you could,
you can't.

225
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,380
That's we,
we belong in sunlight.

226
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,090
And that sunlight is thousands of years
in the future.

227
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:14,690
Even if you could go at a rocketship
near the speed of light,

228
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:17,390
which you can,
it's going to take thousands of years.

229
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,800
We have forgotten.

230
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,860
We've got things on the books,
laws on the books,

231
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:24,680
uh,
understandings with other nations on the

232
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:27,850
books 50 years ago that we've forgotten
what they were and why you mill.

233
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,521
Oh,
that's right.

234
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:30,650
We made a,
an agreement 50 years ago.

235
00:13:30,651 --> 00:13:34,310
We forgotten in 50 years what that
agreement was or what we were supposed

236
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:37,340
to do,
or imagine going a thousand years on a,

237
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:40,580
on a voyage and somebody's saying 500
years from now,

238
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,380
why are we here?
What are we,

239
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,070
where are we going on cheese?
I forgotten what the,

240
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,750
let's look back in the library and
dusting off 500 years old.

241
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:53,680
That's right.
We're on our way to send us a what,

242
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:54,830
why,
why are we going there?

243
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,780
Maybe let's turn around.
Maybe if they can figure out where I'm

244
00:13:57,781 --> 00:14:00,600
hold travel and get us to some
exoplanets in,

245
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,920
you know,
10 minutes,

246
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,530
then we'll be in that situation.
But.

247
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,310
Exactly.
And,

248
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,700
and that's theoretically possible as
well.

249
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,630
Maybe.
Yeah.

250
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,730
I mean stephen hawking seems to think
so.

251
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,770
But uh,
so.

252
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,780
Okay.
I think that brings us to the second

253
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:19,140
part of the show where we watch these
short surprise interview clips.

254
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:21,450
I don't know what they are.
I've not seen them.

255
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,680
So I want to,
you know,

256
00:14:22,681 --> 00:14:25,500
we're going to have a genuinely
spontaneous conversation.

257
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,970
The first one,
which is by ryan holiday,

258
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,550
who's an entrepreneur and author

259
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,630
so but with magician were thought
provoking.

260
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:36,464
Is that what the idea is?

261
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,800
Ideally it is thought provoking and if
it's not then it's my job to provoke.

262
00:14:40,801 --> 00:14:41,610
We'll make it fun.
Yeah,

263
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,620
exactly.
okay,

264
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,720
so we'll both watch and then afterward
we'll talk.

265
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,040
There's

266
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,290
a wonderful bill walsh quote about ego.
He says,

267
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,280
no ego is when self confidence becomes
arrogance.

268
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,850
Self assertiveness becomes reckless
abandon and so forth.

269
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:03,684
You say,
he's saying it's,

270
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,220
it's sort of past the point of any
reasonable utility,

271
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,630
right?
Confidence is great.

272
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:13,040
Arrogance is not great,
or cyril connolly's and ego like cancer

273
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,040
is sort of an over assertion of cells
and that sort of.

274
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,040
what I see ego is it's,
it's great to believe in yourself.

275
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,640
The problem is when your belief in
yourself is not based on anything real,

276
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,050
and so that's the enemy of,
of trying to do basically anything that

277
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,570
requires interacting with other people.
Right?

278
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,920
If you're a creative and you're not able
to take feedback because your ego is

279
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:37,730
either so strong or you're not able to
take feedback because you don't care

280
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:40,430
what anyone thinks,
your work's not going to get any better.

281
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:44,180
If you don't care about your audience,
you don't understand who they are and

282
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:46,430
what's going on in their life because
you lack empathy,

283
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,610
which is another symptom of ego.
Your work is going to suffer.

284
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,840
You can't work with other people because
you're.

285
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,170
You have to be.
You're selfish.

286
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,860
You have to be the center of attention
of all times.

287
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,320
You're not going to have a team around
you,

288
00:15:57,321 --> 00:16:00,980
so it basically makes anything that
we're trying to do harder than it

289
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:01,910
already is.

290
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,140
Mm.

291
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,440
I guess I wanted to.
I wanted to get at,

292
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,820
you know,
the old phrase,

293
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,570
fake it till you make it right,
and I don't know whether that advice

294
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:17,300
rings true to you,
but the idea that at a certain point in

295
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:19,550
your career,
like when you're starting out and you're

296
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:22,670
doing a bunch of new things and you're
stretching yourself outside of your

297
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:25,160
comfort zone,
as you kind of said earlier,

298
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:30,161
you have to be sort of in denial,
push down any doubt and just kind of in

299
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:33,380
a way bluster forward perhaps.
But he's,

300
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,290
he's saying that that's kind of a
dangerous state of affairs.

301
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:36,870
I mean the,
uh,

302
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,720
if I'm,
if I'm reading that right.

303
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,100
Well,
let me first of all,

304
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:43,220
correct.
What's not correct but to what I said

305
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:46,340
about denial.
I was half joking about denial,

306
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,860
but indeed as a performer and I was
talking specifically about being on

307
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:54,470
stage and stage fright and all those,
the unknowns or a,

308
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,480
uh,
I'm a pilot for example.

309
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,760
And I remember when I soloed in a cessna
and I was making a turn by myself for

310
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:07,250
the first time,
the shadow of the windshield crossed my

311
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:10,520
face.
And I looked up with a great start

312
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:14,270
thinking something was coming at me with
just the shadow of the windshield.

313
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,380
I was so afraid of what I was doing.
I was up at the year 1500 feet.

314
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:21,530
I didn't know what I was doing.
Now if you panic,

315
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:26,660
god knows what'll happen.
So you need like a test pilot to control

316
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:29,930
that panic and like an athlete and a big
game,

317
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,380
use it so that you.

318
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,510
You extend your,
your faculties to,

319
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,010
to their limit,
right?

320
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,710
Some people can do it by combining the
use of those nerves.

321
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,770
Some people say,
I'm not going to even face those nerves.

322
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,750
I'm going to focus on what it is I have
to do and suppress anything else.

323
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,510
Both work I think.
But if you talk about ego,

324
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,930
then what this gentleman is describing,
ego and and trying to do something

325
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,940
somebody else has never done or that
you've never done.

326
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,720
He starts off with ego and the need for
the self confidence and the feeling that

327
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:11,100
I can do it.
But then he paints a picture of somebody

328
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:15,530
who was so egotistical that he doesn't
listen to anybody else like at a you.

329
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,310
Hey,
watch your ego because you're about to

330
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:20,160
step off the precedent.
So you might say,

331
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:20,730
oh,
well,

332
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,930
that's where the precipice is.
You can still be filled with ego.

333
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,750
I've got the,
I've got the kite in my hands and I'm

334
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:30,960
going to step off the precipice there.
Just point me to where the precipice is

335
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:34,500
if you don't mind,
and I've got the ego that I will sell

336
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:36,660
this kite in space,
uh,

337
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:39,660
but just to help me with the help they
get to the precipice.

338
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,390
You can have the ego and overwhelming
over weaning ego.

339
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,510
what,
what,

340
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:50,510
what kind of a mind would get in a
spaceship and go to mars for the first

341
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:53,220
time?
Who would do that?

342
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,390
Except somebody who thought,
I don't care if I live or die,

343
00:18:57,391 --> 00:19:01,440
I'm going to make this adventure.
The reAlity of the columbus sailing a

344
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:05,220
ship over the edge of the earth.
The reality is that he knew the earth

345
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:07,080
was curved or he heard the earth was
covered,

346
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:10,170
but there were many of us crew who
thought the earth was flat.

347
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,720
You sell long enough,
you fall over the edge.

348
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,810
They were on the edge of a precipice.
They thought,

349
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,780
or certainly columbus thought,
screw it.

350
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,670
I'm going forward and I'm taking the
risk of all these other people's lives

351
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:26,220
because I think we're gonna.
find the spices

352
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,410
and that.
I think that's what I wanted to get at.

353
00:19:28,411 --> 00:19:31,470
You know what?
What he said was that you know you

354
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,590
shouldn't.
You shouldn't overestimate your ability,

355
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,840
but when you are going into the unknown,
you don't know what's going to happen.

356
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,520
yeah,
you don't even need a grand adventure.

357
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,400
What about a relatIonship?
what do you think didn't go well?

358
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,770
I'm going to go.
I'm going to ask that girl for a date,

359
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,590
right?
If you're shy,

360
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:55,580
if you're basic nature is shy and you
feel unworthy and she's so pretty and

361
00:19:55,581 --> 00:19:59,000
she's so.
You think that that's above and you

362
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:04,001
suppress all that and you venture out
onto this flat earth of the edge of a

363
00:20:04,221 --> 00:20:06,170
precipice.
You're going to ask for a date.

364
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,890
Yeah,
you have to suppress all those feelings

365
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:12,640
of inferiority and and think,
I'm,

366
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:14,220
I'm okay,
I'm going to do this to,

367
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,590
and not only that,
but the fact that people,

368
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:23,020
that anybody gets married,
knowing as little as anybody else knows

369
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:26,380
about anybody else,
when at the point at which they get

370
00:20:26,381 --> 00:20:28,420
married,
no matter how well they know each other,

371
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,220
they don't.
They don't know anything.

372
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,580
That's exactly right.
They and I'm,

373
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,610
I'm one of your funeral authorities who
can attest to that very fact.

374
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:43,500
You don't know anybody that you marry
until you've been married a length of

375
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:44,334
time.
Yeah.

376
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,010
Even then strange aspects revealed.

377
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,640
Right?
And so I mean,

378
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:54,641
to go into that kind of adventure which
people do over and over again certainly

379
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,740
requires,
if not ego,

380
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,410
at least some kind of suspension of
disbelief.

381
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,000
You know?

382
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,630
Well,
see,

383
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,650
now you're,
you're in the area of suspension of

384
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:08,710
disbelief that you're okay.
You can do this,

385
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:12,370
this is worthwhile.
And your mother and father say a son,

386
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,770
jason,
don't marry that girl.

387
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,240
Right?
And you say,

388
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,420
dad,
I'm doing it right.

389
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,320
And your dad says,
all right,

390
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,550
it's your life.
Okay,

391
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:23,910
don't Come to me.
And uh,

392
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,590
sometime later you ring your dad and
say,

393
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:27,600
dad,
you were right.

394
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,320
May,
maybe,

395
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,320
maybe he'll be right.
Maybe he won't,

396
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:33,154
but you know,

397
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,250
maybe he'll be watching because he's got
his own prejudices and he doesn't know

398
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:41,170
this girl anymore than you do.
So you can see how complex the picture

399
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:44,540
is without painting a psychopath who
says,

400
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,850
don't talk to me,
don't drive the I know everything.

401
00:21:46,851 --> 00:21:48,280
And I'm a.
And we,

402
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,990
we've heard some of those psychopaths.
I don't talk to me.

403
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,280
I'll fix it.
Uh,

404
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:53,114
I alone,

405
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,430
I believe I was listening to just such a
psychopath two nights.

406
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,570
Well,
there you are.

407
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,110
And that,
that I,

408
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:05,111
I don't admire.
But there are people whose core

409
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:10,660
knowledge of something is so profound
that they say,

410
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:12,340
look,
you don't know what I'm talking about.

411
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,790
Whether it's higher maths or
astrophysics or,

412
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,430
or this relationship,
you don't know what I know and I

413
00:22:19,431 --> 00:22:23,740
therefore I'm going ahead with my ego.
I think I'm right and you're wrong.

414
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,400
Those people who have been right and you
were wrong.

415
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,940
We're the people who,
people who explored all those new

416
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:33,430
ventures,
they're the creative,

417
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,780
productive human beings who've lived
individually,

418
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,810
isolated,
individually over the generations.

419
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:45,811
One or two or 10 people in a generation
of made these steps into the unknown

420
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:48,220
that advised against it by everybody.

421
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,940
Well,
you hear these kinds of things like

422
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,330
about,
for example,

423
00:22:51,331 --> 00:22:52,770
stanley kubrick,
right?

424
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,650
Who is undeniably one of the great
directors.

425
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:59,870
Right?
But allegedly he was just completely.

426
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,020
He map out his entire production.
Didn't want to hear from anybody.

427
00:23:04,021 --> 00:23:07,530
Actors were essentIally tools in his
hands.

428
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:08,670
Yeah.
And,

429
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,540
and,
and you know,

430
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,000
you can stand aside and you can look at
that and say,

431
00:23:12,001 --> 00:23:14,070
okay,
that's bad.

432
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,630
Uh,
or he might have learned much.

433
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,110
It's,

434
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,810
but it's not that.
It's a perfect example.

435
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,350
A director of a film has the vision,
right?

436
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:29,440
And his vision may be,
I thought a law those shoes and you need

437
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,610
a tie.
You need to tie the laces on the shoes.

438
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:34,610
That's my vision.
The wardrobe person as well,

439
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,601
you know,
they're,

440
00:23:35,601 --> 00:23:37,520
they're made so that shoe laces are
untIed.

441
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,200
I don't care.
My vision is tie the shoe laces as

442
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:43,310
incidental.
Is that,

443
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,070
that's the vision.
Why that be eager?

444
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,220
Sure.
Why should the wardrobe mistress have a

445
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:51,550
vision that supersede the director?

446
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,560
Yeah,
and I think it's probably true also,

447
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:58,090
and you've worked with many directors
that people have just different styles,

448
00:23:58,091 --> 00:24:00,520
some are more authoritarian and,
and,

449
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,690
and always in charge of everything and
some are probably like,

450
00:24:04,691 --> 00:24:05,020
I know that

451
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,620
Jason Martin collaborative to do it has
to do with the vision.

452
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,610
Yeah.
A director may have a vision and every

453
00:24:12,611 --> 00:24:16,660
aspect like why would a painter say to
you?

454
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,760
Um,
okay,

455
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:22,761
yeah,
go ahead and dabs of some color on my

456
00:24:22,901 --> 00:24:23,950
painting.
It's okay.

457
00:24:23,951 --> 00:24:25,810
Sure.
He's got the vision.

458
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,740
He's painting the whole picture.
That's what that kind of director would

459
00:24:29,741 --> 00:24:31,060
do.
Other directors say,

460
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:31,900
well,
it doesn't matter.

461
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:32,621
Tie the shoe.
Listen,

462
00:24:32,621 --> 00:24:34,170
don't tell the show.
I'm cutting up

463
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,540
above it.
And that's their vision anyway,

464
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,470
right?
That's right.

465
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,203
Yeah.

466
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,510
So you,
it's hard to argue what Is ego and what

467
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,200
does a psychopathic.

468
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,210
Right,
right.

469
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,730
Yeah.
What is ego in the healthy sense of sort

470
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,670
of knowing what you're doing and knowing
why.

471
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,310
Is there anything healthy about ego?
Right?

472
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,460
Well,
yeah.

473
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,100
I mean it seems so.
I mean.

474
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,210
Well yeah,
because most people,

475
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,490
you know,
what did the first person to say,

476
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:06,190
look,
we've just come out of the tree,

477
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,720
let's head north.
Right.

478
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,730
And the evolution of mankind began.
Some individuals had.

479
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,160
That's I,
you know,

480
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:16,480
I'm tired of sleeping on the tree here.
That's lie on the ground.

481
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,280
It seems much more comfortable.
yeah.

482
00:25:18,281 --> 00:25:21,910
But you'll get eaten.
I think I'll be alert enough to hear the

483
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:22,744
tiger.

484
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,550
Yeah,
it's called leadership basically.

485
00:25:25,551 --> 00:25:26,150
It's called

486
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,750
leadership.
That's exactly right.

487
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,910
And how can you lead with a group of
people?

488
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:35,510
It's complex by fred and this guy
telling us that the ego then leads you

489
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:39,290
into a psychiatry is as I think,

490
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,590
interesting.
Incorrect.

491
00:25:40,591 --> 00:25:43,290
Okay.
Let's leave it at that assessment and

492
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:48,291
let's move on since our time is,
is a little limited to the next surprise

493
00:25:48,451 --> 00:25:50,850
video and that's nickeel go.
Oh,

494
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:52,950
he's an educatIon expert.

495
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,063
Alright.

496
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,870
The statistics show that bullying is a
major,

497
00:26:01,871 --> 00:26:06,430
major problem in most american schools
and what they find is that in school

498
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,880
schools have a number of different
qualities and one of them is the

499
00:26:09,881 --> 00:26:12,000
antidemocratic governing structure.
Uh,

500
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,540
if you look in most american high
schools,

501
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:16,450
for example,
they are a gargantuan mammoth

502
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,180
institutions.
They have thousands upon thousands of

503
00:26:19,181 --> 00:26:20,310
kids,
uh,

504
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,650
walking through the hallways every day,
uh,

505
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:25,870
and what,
what happens as a result of this,

506
00:26:25,871 --> 00:26:29,410
and this is not necessarily the fault of
teachers or even just the people in that

507
00:26:29,411 --> 00:26:32,710
school building.
When you have such a large student body

508
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,800
and you don't have a,
you have large class sizes.

509
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:39,130
There's not enough time for students and
teachers to have really strong,

510
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,860
authentic and genuine relationships and
students.

511
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:46,440
Basically what happens is they don't
have any relationships with fellow peers

512
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,170
and students that are really rich and
authentic level.

513
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,940
And so when students feel that they have
no power or no agency in their school

514
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,340
experiences,
what often happens is something called

515
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:59,220
clicks arise.
If students feel that they have to wield

516
00:26:59,221 --> 00:27:03,120
power and get control within themselves
and within their ranks,

517
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,170
and so clicks are one of the major
phenomenons in american schools where

518
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:10,620
they create basically power structures
within the student body of themselves.

519
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,000
I actually Want to start in a sort of
oblique way and then come to the bigger

520
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:20,100
ideas here.
I wanted to start with like,

521
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,320
you know,
let us take a trip in the wayback

522
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,520
machine to Canada.
When you were a kid where they're

523
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:28,860
bullIes in your school,
were you a bully?

524
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:30,170
Were you bullied?
Was there,

525
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,060
was that a thing in your that you dealt
with?

526
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,871
Uh,
well,

527
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:35,950
you want,
you want to bring this specifically?

528
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,150
Yeah,
why not?

529
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,280
And bullying.
I want to start.

530
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,230
Well,
I mean I just find that it's sometimes

531
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:45,230
helpful to go from the particular to the
general and it,

532
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,300
and a little more colorful.
I'm happy to.

533
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:48,850
Yeah.

534
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,120
well,
when I went to a grade school and maybe

535
00:27:52,121 --> 00:27:55,540
even as far as high school,
I was brought up in montreal,

536
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,374
Canada.
Okay.

537
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:01,470
And I'm jewish and uh,
being jewish in the miller that I was in

538
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,280
a,
it was an unusual and so I was attacked

539
00:28:06,281 --> 00:28:11,090
a lot as a kid for being jewish and I
had flights every day.

540
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:16,100
It was more than one guy at a time and
crowds of kids gathered around yelling,

541
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:16,721
fight,
fight,

542
00:28:16,721 --> 00:28:18,970
fight,
and I'd be the one in the fight trying

543
00:28:18,971 --> 00:28:22,780
to handle one if not two and sometimes
three kids my size,

544
00:28:22,781 --> 00:28:27,781
my age and I had fights all the time.
And one bully I remember in particular

545
00:28:28,811 --> 00:28:33,700
who was,
there were places where coal was dumped

546
00:28:33,701 --> 00:28:38,560
into the furnaces,
so they were raised like two feet above

547
00:28:38,561 --> 00:28:43,561
the ground and so they provided a place,
maybe four foot square that was like a

548
00:28:44,051 --> 00:28:47,200
crowning place.
So somebody would stand on this and be

549
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:49,870
the bully and then they try and get you
off.

550
00:28:49,871 --> 00:28:53,230
That was part of the game to see you
could stand on the highest place,

551
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,500
the longest part of a bullying campaign.
But that's my experience about being

552
00:28:59,411 --> 00:29:02,230
bullied.
I was bullied all the time.

553
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,090
Now,

554
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,380
I mean,
just looking back,

555
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:05,550
do you feel,
I mean,

556
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:07,590
not that anyone would wish that on their
child,

557
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:11,340
but did you become like tough as a
result of that or was that.

558
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,310
Well,
that's,

559
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,970
that's an interesting aspect.
You know,

560
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,460
wish on your child is an interesting
phrase.

561
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:21,760
You wish only the best for your child
kindness agonists,

562
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,950
ambition,
a softness,

563
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,360
delightful pink,
uh,

564
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,520
lots of food,
leonardo soft bed,

565
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,520
good.
You wish they would have that,

566
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,970
but what does that make?
Right?

567
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,390
What kind of a child does that make?
When you talk aBout bullying,

568
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,660
it seems to me you need to look at life
around you.

569
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:45,340
You look at other animals living in
concert with each other.

570
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,520
Look at a wolf pack.
Every social animal that I can think of.

571
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,900
Chimpanzees as close to human beings.
Apes,

572
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,750
all the great apes in concert.
When they live in concert,

573
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:04,110
there's one or two alpha males or uh,
in elephants.

574
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,800
Maybe it's a matriarchal and the alpha
female and they alone,

575
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:13,450
at least in the wolves,
they alone breed and their children are

576
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:15,400
alpha children.
Then they're handled.

577
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,760
Even the insects bees.
Think of it most maybe all aspects of

578
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:25,750
life living together.
There's a dominant individual,

579
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:30,240
but at the same time,
don't we have to say that like humans,

580
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:34,320
while we are like other pieces were
differentiated by the fact that we have

581
00:30:34,321 --> 00:30:37,290
a prefrontal cortex,
we organized into societies,

582
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,500
we have the option to make decisions.
We organized into societies in which

583
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:46,680
there's a lead elect them or their
appointed or they assuming there's,

584
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,600
there are leaders and there are
followers.

585
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:54,380
Do the leaders achieve leadership by
bullying that?

586
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,050
What I'm saying is that we.
We don't,

587
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,830
it doesn't necessarily.
We don't have to organize things as

588
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:04,580
killer be killed,
that we are different from other animals

589
00:31:04,581 --> 00:31:05,870
in that.
For example,

590
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,570
we,
you and I are not going out every day

591
00:31:08,571 --> 00:31:11,960
and like ms dot shetty and people.
Now there are humans that are doing

592
00:31:11,961 --> 00:31:13,120
that,
but no,

593
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,110
but how did you get this podcast?
Well,

594
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,510
not by machete,
well,

595
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,940
not literally,
but did you push somebody aside who

596
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:23,410
might've had a podcast?
I mean,

597
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,900
not,
not literally,

598
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,740
but I've just literally.
But somebody could have had a job,

599
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:30,760
but you got It.
Right,

600
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:31,361
right,
right.

601
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:33,100
Good point.
Good point.

602
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,470
Um,
I love making a good point.

603
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,170
No,
it's,

604
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,060
it's,
it's good.

605
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,060
So you know,
going back to what he was saying in

606
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:45,061
terms of power structures and how they
create

607
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,460
bullying,
I mean regardless of whether we think

608
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:49,720
that this is a natural.

609
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,030
No,
not regardless.

610
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,500
That's the point.
Okay.

611
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:58,740
The point is it seems to be a natural
evolvement evolution in,

612
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:03,520
in a,
in a group that if the group has to do

613
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:07,010
something other than just sit around and
go into the ocean and,

614
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:09,670
and toast marshmallows by the campfire
then,

615
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,490
but then somebody brought the
marshmallows and somebody made the

616
00:32:12,491 --> 00:32:17,260
sticks.
So in every group that needs to go to do

617
00:32:17,261 --> 00:32:18,670
something,
go someplace,

618
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,310
there's always a leader.
Let's go there now let's go.

619
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,880
Okay,
let's go seven steps in that direction.

620
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,753
See what happens.

621
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,360
Yeah.
I guess where I guess where I want to

622
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,990
and you know,
and we're not debating.

623
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:31,250
I mean I guess where I,
where I,

624
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,990
where we are different.
Well where I differ is maybe we are.

625
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:40,190
Where I differ is just using the word
defer differ william.

626
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,190
We are not,
it's not a zero sum game.

627
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,620
Like we're not,
nobody's keeping score,

628
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:46,454
right?
I,

629
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,750
that's not,
I don't,

630
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm not trying to win the podcast.
You Are.

631
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,870
Okay.
So know what I'm saying is like

632
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,500
leadership and bullying aren't
necessarily the same thing.

633
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,660
Are they?
oh,

634
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,503
I mean,

635
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,650
leadership and bullying are not the same
thing.

636
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,380
So where do you go?
Where do you,

637
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,470
where do you work?
How do you mitigate all those things?

638
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,950
So let me tell you what,
what I think about that.

639
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:17,520
I think we need to teach from birth on
empathy.

640
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:23,710
we need to teach the ability from one
human being to the other to place

641
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:28,570
yourself in that person's running shoes.
Baby shoes,

642
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:34,180
spikes writing shoes.
We need to everybody to say,

643
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:39,270
listen to what this person is saying and
crying out for help to be listened to.

644
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,340
Look at my experience here.
Look at what you've trIed on my toes and

645
00:33:45,341 --> 00:33:48,100
that hurt.
Let me explain to you this hurt.

646
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:53,101
You've crushed my toes and that hurts
and I don't want to hurt you.

647
00:33:53,471 --> 00:33:56,050
And norman,
maybe I'm not incapable of hurting you,

648
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:01,350
but listen to how I'm hurting.
And maybe you don't do it again and you

649
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:06,420
teach empathy to children because
empathy may not be natural sympathy

650
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:12,190
maybe,
but empathy to live in somebody else's

651
00:34:12,191 --> 00:34:17,191
mind for a moment and understand
completely what that other person is

652
00:34:17,861 --> 00:34:21,700
feeling,
I think is taught and you need to teach

653
00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:25,900
that.
And as a result of that may be aspects

654
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:28,570
of bullying would dissipate.

655
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,360
yeah.
Maybe there could be more empathetic

656
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,980
leadership,
for example,

657
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:38,170
more empathetic leadership which will
hopefully get after this upcoming

658
00:34:38,171 --> 00:34:39,490
election.
Fingers crossed.

659
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:42,850
We'll see.
I'm william shatner.

660
00:34:42,851 --> 00:34:46,570
It has been great talking to you and I
think we'll leave it there because we

661
00:34:46,571 --> 00:34:51,460
are almost out of time.
And a zero g zero g is the new book.

662
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:54,760
It is really,
really interesting and exciting.

663
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:58,150
And it's set in the 20 slash 25 slash 50
really?

664
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,310
But
no,

665
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,700
it's all right.
Just a few years difference.

666
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,790
I'm being empathetic.
Being an empathetic leader.

667
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:08,890
I do it.
Don't worry about it.

668
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,620
Did I understand you made a mistake in
2025 but it's really 20 slash 50 but not

669
00:35:14,621 --> 00:35:15,970
to worry about it.
I'm with you.

670
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,110
Alright.
And let's go test marshmallows and go to

671
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:22,390
those.
Thanks so much for your pleasure talking

672
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:23,140
to you,
jason.

673
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,160
Pleasure talking to you.

674
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:29,870
Yeah,
and

675
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,040
that wraps up another episode of think
again.

676
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,430
I know you are busy.
I know you have lots of good things to

677
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:40,431
do with your time still.
If you like our show or love our show,

678
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:43,260
and especially if you're listening
regularly and you haven't had the chance

679
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:46,320
to do so yet,
I would really appreciate it.

680
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:50,370
If you could rate or review us on itunes

Thank you.

682
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,380
We are back next week with novelists,
jodie pekoe,

683
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,280
whose new book is a big departure for
her.

684
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:01,590
It deals with racism in contemporary
America.

685
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,390
See that.
