1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,040
Globally,
I think we are not taking advantage of

2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,290
our ability to create,
um,

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,460
multi nation,
multilateral alliances,

4
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,910
I think even on a smaller scale than
nations and we're not doing enough to

5
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:39,920
combat global warming.
We're not doing enough to educate people

6
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:42,230
who are incredibly talented in this
world.

7
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:47,231
We're not doing enough to deliver
healthcare to infants and children and

8
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:51,870
women who are,
um,

9
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,000
again,
wanting to be enterprising around the

10
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:58,900
world.
Those are the,

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,820
the issues that we're not addressing,
but there's one underlying cause of are

12
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,510
not addressing that,
I believe,

13
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,780
which is not taking advantage of how we
can come together despite our

14
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:15,560
differences and deliberate and decide to
do good.

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,800
We need more institutions that bring us
together in civil but robust ways to do,

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,240
to do good in the world
as a great constitutional democracy

17
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,260
should be at the center of the
democracies of the world.

18
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,970
Working multilaterally to bring more
peace and democracy and economic

19
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:55,601
wellbeing to the Group of Democracies
that are ready,

20
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,540
agree that democracy is a good thing.
And to those non democratic countries

21
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,870
where we can act multilaterally rather
than unilaterally.

22
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:12,800
We're not doing that.
Were at a depaul in Iraq right now,

23
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,280
I don't have the formula for digging us
out of it,

24
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,620
but when you're in a depo,
you don't keep digging

25
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,790
individually.
We should each use our talents to a lot

26
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,160
with other people,
not necessarily people and ideally not

27
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:41,801
people who are just like us,
but to ally with other people to do some

28
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:46,850
good in the world.
That means whether it we should be

29
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,050
educating kids who otherwise wouldn't
get education.

30
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,560
We should be figuring out ways of
decreasing carbon emissions,

31
00:02:57,021 --> 00:03:01,750
if that's what we have the talent and
the opportunity to do.

32
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,070
We should be delivering healthcare,
um,

33
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,400
to people not as individuals,
but as collectivities and not depending

34
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,060
too much on our government for doing it
because a dependence citizenry is asking

35
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:28,390
for trouble.
We have to take initiatives all over and

36
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:31,600
I would say first and foremost,
we have to begin locally.

37
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,140
That is the idea that we would know how
to save the world without doing some

38
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:42,250
good in our own community is a form of
Hubris and it's a form of Hubris that's

39
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:43,900
brought a lot of damage to the world.
