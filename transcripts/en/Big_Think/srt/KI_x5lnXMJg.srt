1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,810
I think most of us dread Mondays because
culturally we've learned to dread

2
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:05,700
Mondays.
We live for the weekend.

3
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:07,530
Our music is,
you know,

4
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:12,270
celebrates Fridays better than Monday.
Our movies celebrate Fridays better than

5
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:13,440
Monday.
Um,

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,270
and,
and maybe our parents did too.

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,750
I think there was a generation that
didn't have the same freedoms you and I

8
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:19,740
have.
Um,

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,510
30 years ago,
40 years ago,

10
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:25,680
I couldn't have this conversation where
I could say to the camera to everybody

11
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:26,880
watching,
hey,

12
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:29,790
you have a chance to plug into a
community that will help you.

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,100
You didn't,
how would you even find those people in

14
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:34,890
1960?
How has your mom or your dad going to

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,890
find a community of other people,
other photographers,

16
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:39,660
other artists,
other bankers,

17
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:41,940
other anything's easily,
they couldn't.

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,180
So I think we have access to people and
tools and experiences that no other

19
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:49,410
generation had access to.

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,720
And so in addition to that being a huge
opportunity,

21
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:56,310
it's a huge responsibility.
We have a chance to break that mold of a

22
00:00:56,311 --> 00:01:00,270
job is just the job.
Monday is horrible and Friday is great.

23
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,590
What if we got to reinvent that?
What if we got to rescue Mondays and

24
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:07,680
that doesn't mean be fake.
I'm not saying tomorrow turn a frown

25
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:08,670
upside down.
No,

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,820
I'm much more practical than that.
You're going to have some difficult

27
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,530
days,
some Tuesdays that aren't fun.

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,980
There's no such thing as a perfect job.
That's one of the things that cripples

29
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:19,290
people.
They think I have to find the perfect

30
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:22,860
job where I only do things I want to do
and that doesn't exist.

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,840
But what if you could say,
okay,

32
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,970
can I use more of me at my next job?
Can I use more of me on a Monday?

33
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:31,530
Then I got to a week ago?

34
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,420
Can I use more of the things I'm good
at?

35
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:35,580
Can I start to look forward to going to
work?

36
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,970
Can I start to look forward to a
Wednesday and not just live in this

37
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:43,500
culture that only celebrates Friday?
I don't want us to have a life where we

38
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:47,160
feel like Tim Robbins at the end of
Shawshank redemption as we drive away

39
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:49,560
from work on Friday,
this sense of relief.

40
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:54,240
Finally I got out of that because here's
the thing that's really bad math and

41
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:55,410
here's what I mean by that.
Somebody,

42
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:58,740
many saying to you,
we'll give you two weeks of vacation and

43
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:01,260
exchange.
We want you to give us 50 weeks.

44
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:04,650
This year.
50 for two is terrible math trading.

45
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:08,610
50 weeks of misery for two weeks of
vacation is bad math trading.

46
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:13,260
Five days you don't like for two days.
You do like again is bad math training,

47
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,210
40 years of your life.
I mean,

48
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:16,920
that's the thing.
That's why I write about career.

49
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,640
You're going to do this thing for 40
years,

50
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,790
40 to 60 hours a week.
Let's invest in it.

51
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,660
Let's make it as good as it can be.
Let's make it as awesome as it can be

52
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,510
because it matters.
We're talking about four decades of your

53
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:32,820
life.
Certainly we should lean into that.

54
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:34,860
Okay.
