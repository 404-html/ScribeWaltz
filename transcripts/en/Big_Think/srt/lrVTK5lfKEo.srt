1
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,370
Probably
the,

2
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,490
uh,
most important

3
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,110
way of
resolving issues.

4
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,450
Is it face to face confrontation is a
personal,

5
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:38,970
uh,

6
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,930
interaction.
And far too often things are left to

7
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,540
other sort of

8
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,370
others to try to solve what the
principles should be solving these

9
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:07,130
issues by direct,
uh,

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,610
interaction.
Uh,

11
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,200
surely it,
we're doing lots of things,

12
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:11,670
right?
Uh,

13
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,290
you know,
one of the problems is,

14
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,140
uh,
you know,

15
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,170
we,
we dwell on the things that aren't

16
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:21,060
right,
because those are the things we want to

17
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:24,780
change.
Those are the things we want to correct.

18
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,990
Uh,
but it's an awful lot that's being done

19
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:32,991
right.
And I think in the last seven years,

20
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,700
uh,
in New York City,

21
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,180
uh,
as a whole different attitude about

22
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:41,340
living in the city,
about working in the city,

23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,700
about how you interact with people that
you don't know.

24
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,690
Uh,
and that has to do with just a change of

25
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,780
how things are done.
Uh,

26
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,853
both the,
uh,

27
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,540
from the public perspective as well as
from a private perspective.

28
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,350
Uh,
as an architect,

29
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,700
I can't say there's been a great deal of
good architecture,

30
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,900
uh,
that's,

31
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,990
uh,
a resident in this city.

32
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,170
But there's a different attitude about
architecture in this city than ever

33
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:21,960
existed before.
It has to do with a feeling this is our

34
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:23,970
place,
that you'd be great.

35
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,570
And I think there's that never existed
before.

36
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,920
So how do we cope now?
We're beyond that.

37
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:40,740
Yeah.
