1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,450
In these times,
technology

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,860
is,
uh,

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,970
generally decreasing communication.
I mean real communication.

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,560
Um,
cell phones,

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,650
Internet.
There's a superficiality involved.

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,670
And also again,
a separation from the content and from

7
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:35,090
the person delivering the content.
Um,

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,750
people ask,
I don't have a cell phone myself.

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,920
People ask me,
well,

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,000
don't you feel that it makes
communication easier and better?

11
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,670
Well,
frankly,

12
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,540
no,
I don't.

13
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,570
I think that most often a cell phone is
used for superfluous conversation.

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,800
Where are you?
Is the most asked question on a cell

15
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:59,510
phone?
So who cares?

16
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:02,930
Does that make my life better?
If I know that you're standing on the

17
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:07,550
corner of Fifth Avenue and 18th Street,
is that communication?

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,190
Are we,
are we really communicating?

19
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,240
Are we connecting or is there something
in between us?

20
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:19,330
And is that technology that's standing
in between us rather than

21
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,270
[inaudible].
