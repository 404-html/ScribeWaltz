1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,770
The animal kingdom is full of,
uh,

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,860
an amazing,
amazing behaviors typically in which

3
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:13,770
males are trying to attract females.
Um,

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,410
so most of the time through the animal
kingdom,

5
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:18,870
females are the ones who tend to be very
choosy.

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,610
I'm so they pick between different males
based on their attributes in part

7
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:27,480
because males typically don't donate
much other than their good sperm and

8
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:28,810
they're good jeans.
Uh,

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,140
so females,
females tend to care a lot about your,

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,840
how good a male looks you,
how awesome his song is,

11
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:37,350
how great his dances and so on.
And this leads to a pressure for males

12
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:41,580
to kind of ratchet it up and have a bit
of an arms race in terms of how awesome

13
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:43,140
their dances and their song is.
And so on,

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,370
some of my favorite examples of a kind
of males ratcheting it up,

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,050
um,
our cases of a species known as the buff

16
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,190
breasted Sandpiper.

17
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,070
Um,
it's this otherwise kind of drab looking

18
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:58,920
Brown Arctic bird.
It's a drab looking because know lives

19
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:01,560
in the Arctic,
very hard to get food and do everything.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,920
Um,
but it kind of allows for it's beauty to

21
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:08,940
come out and really strange ways and one
of these ways is that it has an

22
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:12,510
incredibly attractive armpit.
So it's armpit is very white,

23
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:15,780
very clean,
and it will do a flash displays for

24
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:19,910
females were males will kind of get out
in the field and sort of flash it's

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,160
armpit.
And if the female like the armpit,

26
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,320
they kind of fly from miles and miles
and then they'll kind of do this

27
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:27,330
wonderful display,
uh,

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,760
in the female's fall for it.
They think this is wonderful,

29
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,013
but you can tell,
you know,

30
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,750
kind of which males have the sexy
armpits by,

31
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:34,290
you know,
which ones are kind of flashing all the

32
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,124
females were there.

33
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,640
And so on.
Uh,

34
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,960
they're also,
uh,

35
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,720
other species in which males do
incredible dances to move females.

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,940
Uh,
there's a species of bird known as a

37
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:49,890
mannequin in which a males actually do a
really elaborate dancing display.

38
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,430
It actually involves two partners.
So there's a kind of senior male who

39
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:56,670
gets to mate with the females and
another male who apprentices with him

40
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,700
and has to learn the dance.
And the female picks on the dance of

41
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:01,980
both of them,
even though the senior guy gets the

42
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:04,410
girl.
But then eventually the apprentice will

43
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:07,020
kind of inherit the dancing court and
get the lady.
