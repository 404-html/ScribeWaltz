1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:04,963
My job,
right?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Right now,
I'm not partisan.

3
00:00:06,321 --> 00:00:10,210
So whether Obama was delivering it or
not on leave to others or,

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,810
or my,
my private thoughts,

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,070
um,
any

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,190
buddy running for president and anybody
who serves as president has to do a

7
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:22,790
variety of the same thing,
which is to call up the very basic,

8
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:27,440
traditional American ideals and use them
to make an argument about our place in

9
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:30,230
the world and about public policy.
Uh,

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,360
certainly Obama has done that a lot and
very effectively in this campaign.

11
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:40,361
He places his campaign in this context
of American history and of American

12
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:46,280
ideals in our quest to live up to the
ideals in a way that all the greatest

13
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:50,960
presidential speeches have done from
Lincoln to Roosevelt to,

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,580
to Reagan.
Uh,

15
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:56,810
and that's what you've got to do.
And the John Mccain is not as proficient

16
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,580
a speaker from a prepared text.
He has written books and when he's in a

17
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:03,890
10 meeting,
he could talk the same way and make

18
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:06,590
people really understand how the moment
today,

19
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,880
uh,
meets,

20
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,600
meets the moments where the country has
been courageous in the past.

21
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,930
Yes.

22
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,190
For Mccain.
You know,

23
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:16,970
the challenge is going to be to step up
to him when he has to get the big formal

24
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:17,230
speech.
