1
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,190
There's definitely been a lot of talk
of,

2
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:19,060
of the young Brooklyn writer,
and then there's now been the backlash

3
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,740
for sure.
Um,

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,200
you know,
I got called the Brooklyn Writer,

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,600
uh,
not too long ago,

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:31,050
and I was torn between a sense of pride
or a sense of embarrassment because now

7
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,730
it's become such a thing.
Um,

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,760
I think we again,
have to think of why that phenomenon

9
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:37,594
exists,
right?

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,320
Brooklyn was initially a cheap
neighborhood for writers to live and you

11
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:44,140
could have space and you could probably,
most importantly,

12
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:45,910
you'd have your own office,
which,

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,090
which is what I have now in my current
place in Brooklyn.

14
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:52,660
I have a nice office.
I wouldn't have been able to get that in

15
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:56,620
Manhattan at the modest price and I'm
paying.

16
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,200
So there's those considerations.
Um,

17
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,600
but then,
you know,

18
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,140
you get enough artists and writers
moving to neighborhood,

19
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:05,711
uh,
the,

20
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:08,710
the thing begins to brand itself,
um,

21
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,300
probably originating in a sense of
pride,

22
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:13,630
right?

23
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,261
People saying,
well,

24
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:14,891
yeah,
you know,

25
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:17,140
we're Brooklyn Writers and this is a
thing and,

26
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,110
you know,
trying to defend themselves and then it

27
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:22,870
becomes a sort of embarrassing brand.
Um,

28
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,850
so yeah,
there's,

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,120
there's times you,
you have to sort of say it with a smile,

30
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,950
you know,
that you're a Brooklyn writer,

31
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,420
but,
um,

32
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,780
but that's probably going to change
because Brooklyn is getting awfully

33
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:39,670
expensive to the point where it's
definitely in competition with

34
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,500
Manhattan,
uh,

35
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,500
especially the savory parts.
And,

36
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:45,191
uh,
so I don't know.

37
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:46,670
I wonder in a few years,
are we going to have the,

38
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,400
the queen's writer,
you know,

39
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,910
and then far into the future when the
Staten Island writer,

40
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,590
you know,
if it's scary.

41
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,420
Um,
but what I don't like about it is that

42
00:01:58,421 --> 00:02:03,400
it takes so much attention from all the
writers that don't even live in New

43
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,740
York.
That's one thing about the book tour

44
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:10,560
that was so interesting to me and about
the friendships that I've forged with

45
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,060
the writers who live all over this
country.

46
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,870
And,
and,

47
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,580
you know,
I think I always thought that as a

48
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:16,900
writer,
you need it to live here,

49
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:17,511
you know?
And,

50
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:19,960
and even recently,
I thought it's a good idea to be near my

51
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,370
editor,
my agent,

52
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:22,390
or to,
you know,

53
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:24,430
and it's,
it's sort of a fallacy.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,090
Um,
so I,

55
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:30,940
I don't like the feeling that I don't
like spreading the,

56
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:35,830
the sort of idea that,
that writers need to live,

57
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,490
if not in the Manhattan,
then right by it.

58
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,550
Um,
because the beauty is now you can,

59
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,520
for the most part,
live everywhere anywhere you want.

60
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,380
Um,
but,

61
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,670
um,
I do love Brooklyn and I like,

62
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,520
and I like my,
my new neighborhood and Kensington,

63
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:57,070
there's a lot of,
it was a very vibrant Middle Eastern

64
00:02:57,071 --> 00:03:00,100
community there that I can spy on,
which is fun.

65
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,690
Um,
and you get a great diversity in

66
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:06,940
Brooklyn,
um,

67
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,310
and it is affordable and it's beautiful.
So it's a formula.
