Brian mitchell,
who's first name is spelled like mine,

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,680
m a r I a,
but it's pronounced Mariah and not

3
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:14,170
Maria,
is the first recognized female

4
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:19,171
astronomer in America and was the first
woman elected unanimously to the

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,860
American Academy of Arts and Sciences in
1831 when she was still a teenager

6
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:27,580
obsessed with stargazing.
She heard that the king of Denmark had

7
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:30,370
offered a gold metal valued at 20 ducats
cats,

8
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:34,360
which was a lot of money at the time to
the first person to discover a

9
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:39,310
telescopic comic.
It took her 16 years to master the

10
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:44,311
science and the craft of observation,
but she did become the first person and

11
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,560
see 18,
47.

12
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:52,561
T one was known for a hundred years as
ms dot Mitchell's comments.

13
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,050
Later when she was hired to teach
astronomy at Vassar,

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,250
the newly established Vassar College,
she was the first woman on the faculty

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,580
and according to the official handbook
of college rules,

16
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,000
female students were not allowed to go
outside after dark.

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,450
This was a problem for the study of
astronomy.

18
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,350
I'm Mitchell fought tirelessly to
overturn not just this,

19
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:19,351
but many other roles based on antiquated
gender norms that held back women in

20
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:20,800
science.
Later,

21
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:25,420
she was hired as the first woman to
perform a nondomestic specialized skill

22
00:01:25,421 --> 00:01:29,770
for the US federal government.
She was paid $300 a year for her job as

23
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:33,790
a computer,
a Venus for the United States Nautical

24
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,890
Almanac.
It was a very,

25
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:40,870
very mathematically rigorous job that
require her to perform very complex

26
00:01:40,871 --> 00:01:45,070
calculations that would predict the
position of Venus in the sky for years

27
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:48,010
to come.
And in the days before gps and

28
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:50,710
satellites.
This is how sailors all over the world

29
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,800
navigated the oceans.
By the time she was 40,

30
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:57,220
Mitchell had reached celebrity status as
one of the most famous women in the

31
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:59,320
world,
which is a remarkable feat for a

32
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:03,250
scientist even today.
We don't have many celebrity scientists,

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,740
uh,
but she was most beloved for her

34
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:09,040
extraordinary generosity of spirit that
went along with her genius.

35
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,700
She didn't much care for the accolades
and the recognition and the celebrity,

36
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:17,701
but she went out of her way to mentor
and help cultivate the talents of women

37
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:19,690
in science,
uh,

38
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,670
which required that she overcame her
painful shyness in order to be a public

39
00:02:24,671 --> 00:02:28,120
speaker and a public figure and a role
model and an educator,

40
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:31,960
which he continued to be.
She continue to teach right up until her

41
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:33,580
death.
Hm.
