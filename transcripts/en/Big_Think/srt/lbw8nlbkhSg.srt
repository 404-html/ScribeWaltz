1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,120
The first thing I would say,
and I do tell parents this has just

2
00:00:06,121 --> 00:00:08,400
figure out what it is that their kid is
interested in.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,070
Um,
and also what are the kinds of things

4
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:14,850
that they may be struggling with.
So if there's a child that is,

5
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:18,030
I'm struggling with,
um,

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,770
a certain way of conceiving of complex
problems.

7
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:24,450
So maybe they're struggling in math a
little bit.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,660
There is a lot of different kinds of
games that give kids practice in a

9
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:33,540
ordering certain kinds of problems
working through kinds of certain

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,920
sequences of logic.
Maybe there's a kid that has a passion

11
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:41,910
around sports.
Sports Games are a great opportunity for

12
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:45,270
them to get in there and play with their
friends,

13
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:47,850
but also gained some facility around the
technology.

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,220
Um,
and so it mostly has to do with trying

15
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:53,370
to match an interest that their child
might have with,

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,370
um,
one a game might be offering,

17
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:59,310
not just in terms of content but also in
the type of game.

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,890
So if you have a kid that is,
let's say,

19
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:04,290
really interested in,
and I'll go back to the math and

20
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:07,050
engineering.
There's a whole genre of games about

21
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:10,770
building stuff that might be a great job
of game for that kid.

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,230
Um,
there may be a kid that's really

23
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:16,080
interested,
very detail oriented type a personality

24
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:20,790
kid a real time strategy.
Games are a great genera of games for

25
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:25,350
those kids and those are games where you
are managing complex sets of resources

26
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,590
in a simulation environment and try to
advance toward a particular kind of

27
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:31,140
goal.
Maybe you have a kid that's really

28
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,290
creative and interested in more open
ended kind of exploration.

29
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,910
There's a whole genre of adventure
games,

30
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,010
um,
that might be really good for that

31
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:39,810
particular kind of child.
Um,

32
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,540
so just really has to do with what the
situation is.

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,250
Well,
the most important thing we know from a

34
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:49,680
learning perspective is um,
talk.

35
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:55,370
So kids that grow up in households where
they don't have an opportunity to talk

36
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,890
with parents about what they're doing.
Um,

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,830
the kids tend to struggle in many ways
because they haven't again,

38
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,960
been given the opportunity to practice
with the language,

39
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,650
with using words,
with putting together a complex ideas

40
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,950
with creating arguments.
So the,

41
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:16,350
the simplest and biggest thing a parent
can do with a child is sit down and play

42
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:18,090
with them,
play the game with them,

43
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,090
talked to them about what they're doing,
prompt them,

44
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:25,200
ask them questions.
A kids love it when the parent asks them

45
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:28,110
to show that the kid will show the
parent how to do something.

46
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,521
Um,
we have,

47
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:31,710
uh,
a program at the Institute of play

48
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:36,270
called play force where we bring in kids
from third grade up until college and

49
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:38,900
they play test games for us and they,
um,

50
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,480
tell us what they think are valuable
about the games and what we found is

51
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:46,260
with some of the younger kids that the
moms started coming in with the kids and

52
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:48,060
they would sit next to him and start to
play.

53
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,780
And there was um,
a radical change in the relationship

54
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,080
between the parents understanding of
what their kids were learning from these

55
00:02:55,081 --> 00:03:00,070
games and be just in the relationship
between that parent and child as the

56
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:03,940
child became an expert in explaining to
the mom what they were doing,

57
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:06,640
what they were learning how to play the
game.

58
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,130
Um,
and so that's a really powerful role

59
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:11,050
that you can put your child in,
um,

60
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:14,680
is letting them be the teacher and
letting them share with you what it is

61
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:17,080
that they find so interesting about this
thing that they're doing.

62
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:20,800
And it has consequences in terms of
their potential for future learning.
