1
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,080
To me,
it's very interesting that it's so

2
00:00:11,081 --> 00:00:12,940
controversial,
the fact that it's,

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,830
it's not deterministic because
throughout my life and medicine I have

4
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:20,680
never,
I very rarely get a test back that is so

5
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:22,510
deterministic,
so you know,

6
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:25,570
even when I was pregnant and,
and I get a variety of tests back and

7
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:26,051
they say,
okay,

8
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:28,090
you're,
this is cutting your risk down for

9
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:30,310
having a down syndrome baby.
But it's never,

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,750
it's never 100 percent,
um,

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,520
unless I did the Amnio,
which I did not do.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,990
So,
you know,

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,540
I've,
and even things like cholesterol,

14
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:38,041
if I,
if I,

15
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,540
if I find out have high cholesterol,
again,

16
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,850
that's a risk base.
It means that I have a risk factor for

17
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:46,000
heart disease.
But it didn't tell me anything specific.

18
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:46,830
It doesn't,
you know,

19
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,240
some people even do very well with
having high cholesterol.

20
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,480
It doesn't say specifically you are
going to die of heart disease.

21
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,550
Um,
so in my opinion,

22
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:55,460
my,
you know,

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,650
I've been very comfortable with having
diagnostic tests that tell me that I

24
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:03,280
might be at higher risk or lower risk
based on some,

25
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,640
some information.
So for the clerk to example that my

26
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:08,950
husband has,
he already knew that he had a family

27
00:01:08,951 --> 00:01:13,870
history of Parkinson's disease and now
he knows that there is a genetic basis

28
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:17,680
for it and that he carries that genetic
basis for it.

29
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,240
So,
you know,

30
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:20,370
again,
he already knew that there was the

31
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,620
family history he has up there and he
has gone through a lot of the

32
00:01:23,621 --> 00:01:25,210
literature.
One of the things that he's found is

33
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:28,690
that it's not that well studied just yet
because it was a relatively recent

34
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,000
discovery,
but there is information,

35
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:33,310
there are about things you can do to
prevent Parkinson's.

36
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,480
So that could be changing your diet,
exercising more and potentially drinking

37
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:38,190
coffee.

38
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,820
Um,
and those are all three things that he

39
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:41,080
does.
And,

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,310
and again,
going to the critics,

41
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,250
all three of those things are great for
his health regardless.

42
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,420
So he has lost weight.
He is much more vigilant about,

43
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,161
um,
you know,

44
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:53,530
eating vegetables and he is trying to
drink a little bit of coffee.

45
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,960
So,
so I'm really,

46
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:57,430
you know,
I'm really happy that we got that

47
00:01:57,431 --> 00:02:00,600
information because even if it comes out
later that Oh,

48
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,010
he has other genes that um,
you know,

49
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,370
decreases risk and therefore he's sort
of at average risk for Parkinson's.

50
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,920
You know,
what I'm used to getting that kind of

51
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,440
information in that kind of change in
health care.

52
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,870
And two,
I'm happy because he made a lifestyle

53
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:16,060
change that fundamentally made them
healthier.
