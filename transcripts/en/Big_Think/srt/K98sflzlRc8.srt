1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,580
The secret to gaining the upper hand in
negotiations is giving the other side

2
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:14,581
the illusion of control and the illusion
of control is typically best given with

3
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:23,941
either questions that begin with the
words what or how both what and how

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,600
should be the form of nearly any
question where you're trying to gather

5
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:32,500
information and it's actually one of the
ways we say no.

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,000
The first and best way to say no to
anyone is

7
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,730
how am I supposed to do that?

8
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,210
Now the other side actually has no idea.
Is it a number of things you've done

9
00:00:47,211 --> 00:00:51,410
with them at the same time
you've conveyed to them you have a

10
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:55,430
problem.
Something that we also refer to as

11
00:00:55,431 --> 00:01:00,080
forced empathy because one of the
reasons why we exercise tactical empathy

12
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:02,630
is because we want the other side to see
us fairly.

13
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,980
We want them to see our position.
We want them to see the issues we have.

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,480
We want them to see the constraints that
we have and when you say to somebody,

15
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,250
how am I supposed to do that?
You make them take a look at your

16
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:21,251
situation before they respond and they
think about it in a number of different

17
00:01:22,311 --> 00:01:27,311
ways at a number of different people
I've coached with negotiations who have

18
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:31,490
felt completely helpless.
They felt completely taken hostage.

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,460
One instance where a woman thought she
was taken hostage to the future and she

20
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:38,060
just wasn't getting paid.
They called her up to give him more work

21
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,200
and we taught her to say,
trained or counseled her to say,

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,900
how am I supposed to do that?
They thought about it for awhile.

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,810
I said,
you're right.

24
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:48,644
You can't.

25
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,090
I've noticed that response is not word
for word directly responsive to her

26
00:01:55,091 --> 00:01:57,970
question.
What they responded to was they felt

27
00:01:57,971 --> 00:01:59,080
like.
She said to them,

28
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,570
I can't do this anymore.
I've reached my limit

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,500
and it's a way to establish a limit in a
way that doesn't back the other side

30
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:13,460
into a corner.
You're really want to be able to let out

31
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:18,050
no a little bit at a time,
and the first way to start letting out

32
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:21,110
no as an answer is,
how am I supposed to do that?

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,450
Now ultimately with that question,
we all imagine that the other side is

34
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:27,980
going to say,
because I said so,

35
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,810
because you have to.
That's actually where you ultimately

36
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:37,220
want to be with that question because
when you say how am I supposed to do

37
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:38,360
that,
and the other side says,

38
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:40,400
because if you want this deal,
you'll have to.

39
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,760
What you've just found out is they had
been pushed to the limit on that issue

40
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,930
as far as they'll go and the eternal
question is,

41
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,200
have I gotten everything I could on that
was on the table?

42
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,440
That's a great way to find out whether
or not you've gotten everything you on

43
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:02,800
that particular term because the other
side,

44
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,380
most angry responses because you have
to,

45
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,050
which is not them walking away.
It's not them terminating the deal.

46
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,860
It's not them giving you any more of an
ultimatum.

47
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,510
It's them saying,
no,

48
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,610
I've got no more room to give without
the negotiations breaking off.

49
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,680
So given the other side,
the illusion of control while signaling

50
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:29,380
limits,
it's a great way to stay in the

51
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:32,470
conversation and find out that you're
not leaving anything on the table.

52
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,930
It was coaching a real estate
negotiation recently and that the agent

53
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:42,931
was trying to lease a very expensive
home in the Hollywood hills and the

54
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:45,700
first time they said to the leasing
agent,

55
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,530
how are we supposed to do that?
The leasing agent relented on a number

56
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:54,220
of the terms conversation continued for
awhile.

57
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,760
They came to another term that was
pretty much almost an impasse and the

58
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:03,970
person doing the negotiation says that
how are we supposed to do that?

59
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,910
And the leasing agent said,
if you want the house,

60
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:11,110
you're going to have to do it.
Which was a confirmation that they've

61
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:13,060
gotten as much as it could have out of
that term.

62
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,400
So it's a great way to give the other
side the illusion of control because

63
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:22,420
what many people need to feel like
they're in control under negotiation and

64
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:23,920
when they feel like they're out of
control,

65
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,950
they're impossible to deal with.
So the more you let the other side feels

66
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,440
like they're in control,
the more amenable they are to

67
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:35,350
collaboration.
You really don't want people to feel out

68
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:35,860
of control.
