1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,770
One of the interesting things about
healthcare today is the data is becoming

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,650
unsiloed and increasingly accessible.
So for example,

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,280
I'm wearing right now a little patch
will a company called vital connect or

4
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:20,100
if my shirt,
it's talking to my smartphone live and I

5
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:22,800
can look at my dashboard and my data for
my full,

6
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:27,000
an ekg which will show up right here and
it can track the trends and hopefully my

7
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:28,070
ekg looks like,
oh,

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,820
it's okay.
If there were any cardiologists out

9
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,790
there,
I could also see data about my steps,

10
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,350
my stress level,
my position.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,080
If I fall down and I don't get back up.
Um,

12
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:37,530
the,
the,

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,090
the,
the system can tell that.

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,490
And this is really an intensive care
unit,

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,190
like type level data.
In a way it will be know less than $5 a

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,500
day.
Disposable Patch,

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,630
which can be useful if you're training
for a marathon.

18
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,150
If you're in a hospital and you're not
on a monitored bed.

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,340
If you're home with a disease like heart
failure,

20
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,550
that's a lot of data.
We need to learn to sift through it and

21
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:59,190
pull out the signals because no
physician or nurse is going to want to

22
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:01,400
be liable for watching your live
streaming ekg,

23
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,880
but is an immense amount of power and
data and we're in this era now of

24
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:07,740
creating digital health exhaust.
You know,

25
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:09,900
whether it's my smartwatch,
this patch,

26
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:12,000
my phone,
it can tell a lot about me,

27
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,070
my behaviors.
If for example,

28
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:16,800
you have a patient who's got bipolar
disorder,

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,470
you can tell from their phone whether
they're depressed or they're manic.

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,040
That can play a role in in smart disease
disease management.

31
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,370
We can take technologies like three d
printing and tune homebase prosthetics.

32
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:33,360
We can print prosthetic hands for folks
and legs and the developing world.

33
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,780
Here's mini me and my pocket.
It's a three d printed version of me

34
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,830
that might be interesting if I need to
make a prosthetic for someone who's lost

35
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:45,360
part of their face or I was at mit media
lab last week and met a young grad

36
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:47,670
student who diagnosis ain't own brain
cancer,

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,480
written up in the New York Times and use
three d printing to print a version of

38
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:52,291
his tumor.
Said,

39
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,124
hey,
you want a printer?

40
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,600
Do you want to print in my brain tumor?
This helped us surgeons do a better job

41
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:00,510
of finding it and removing it,
and he was proactive.

42
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:03,090
He noticed some neurologic symptoms and
pushed for his own.

43
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,810
A repeat MRI that helped them get
diagnosed earlier.

44
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,500
I have in my pocket and new
commercialized version of a brain

45
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:12,590
computer interface from a company called
interacts,

46
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:16,090
so this is the muse.
You can wear this headset and kind of

47
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,120
use this for APA.

48
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,510
Find Mindfulness and meditation and I
might use this to prescribe to a patient

49
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:23,850
who has anxiety.
Instead of giving them a drug,

50
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:26,160
I give them a headset.
Of course they can do meditation the old

51
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:28,530
fashioned way,
but this enables you to quantify it and

52
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:32,640
have a bit of a feedback loop.
So the ability to sort of quantify our

53
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:35,430
own minds with brain computer interface
like this can be used to treat

54
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,700
everything from ptsd to Adhd.
We're going to see use of video games to

55
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:44,180
improve cognition or to treat disease.
Um,

56
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,880
we're seeing fancy brain computer
interfaces from my Alma Mater,

57
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:49,170
Brown,
Brown university,

58
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,830
to enable someone who's quadriplegic
just by thinking to move a robotic limb

59
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,870
and those are getting smaller and more
integrated.

60
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:58,380
And so the disabled in the future may
just think move my arm and it'll be

61
00:02:58,381 --> 00:03:01,240
rewired back to the road arm.
It benefit the spinal cord injury.

62
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,150
So lots of ways to take,
you know,

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,000
sometimes consumer devices,
crowdsource new apps and platforms on

64
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,800
these that will change,
you know,

65
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,450
neuroscience,
psychiatry,

66
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,660
and when we can pull this data together
will become,

67
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,780
become participatory in healthcare.
We can move to an era,

68
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:19,720
kind of like with Google maps,
you donate some data when you use ways

69
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,910
and Google maps through privacy,
your speed and your location.

70
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,970
But in exchange,
you can build a map of your,

71
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,730
of the streets and the traffic so you
get some information back.

72
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:30,040
I think we can have that same
sensibility and healthcare,

73
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,730
whether it's sharing your brainwaves,
your genomics,

74
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:36,340
or your wearable data,
while maintaining privacy and optin

75
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,460
abilities.
Using that information can give us

76
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:40,460
better public health,
you know,

77
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,720
better early signals if it's ebola
coming or the common flu,

78
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,930
or can enable patient groups to
crowdsource better cures.

79
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:48,940
For Crohn's disease,
for example,

80
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,010
there's this new world of the
microbiome.

81
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,440
We have 10,000 times 10,
10 times more bacterial cells in an

82
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,240
honorable in and on our bodies and our
own human cells.

83
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,350
We're learning that the microbiome plays
a role in everything from obesity to

84
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:04,450
inflammatory bowel disease,
like Crohn's disease,

85
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,860
maybe even some psychiatric disorders,
and we're starting to be in this era of

86
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,410
fecal transplants.
And you can imagine in five,

87
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:13,600
10 years,
you're going to get to and cocktail of a

88
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,130
probiotic that's going to reboot your gi
system to help treat diseases or prevent

89
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:20,690
them.
So a lot of these tools are gonna.

90
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,380
Enable the clinician.
You're going to be going to your corner,

91
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,720
you know,
pharmacy in many cases to get medical

92
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:28,480
care or telemedicine.
It's gonna enable you as an individual

93
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:31,690
to own your own health information.
There's already thousands of apps out

94
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:33,250
there.
Some are better than others,

95
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:36,740
but you can use those as tools to stay
engaged in taking your vitamin and your

96
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:39,580
aspirin or being on top of a much more
complex regimen.

97
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,870
And the challenge for all of us is to
integrate these in the culture of health

98
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:45,580
and medicine.
You have the best technology,

99
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,060
but unless your clinician uses it and
gets paid for it,

100
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:52,150
in some cases it may never be adapted.
The payers of the world needs to start

101
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,960
looking at how some of these can provide
better outcomes at lower cost and even

102
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:59,470
before they're fda approved.
Bringing these to market and I think

103
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:02,230
we're seeing many smart Pharma
companies,

104
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,940
payers,
physician groups,

105
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:07,480
think about how they layer these in to
be the disrupter and not the disruptee.
