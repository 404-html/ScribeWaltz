1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,560
So consumer electronics has been an
amazing cross industry for the last few

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:13,830
years,
right?

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,830
We've seen this tremendous explosion in
terms of digital TV's in people's homes

4
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:21,840
and mobile devices.
Now people with two,

5
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:26,070
three cell phones are the types of
mobile devices we're seeing net books

6
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:29,070
and so on.
So there's been this big growth of

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,770
devices out there and that's obviously
been a big part of Samsung.

8
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:35,550
It's rise,
but now what we see is more of a

9
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:40,551
transformation to consumer experience.
So it's less and less about the hardware

10
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:44,820
itself.
It's more about the emotional connection

11
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:48,180
with it.
It's about the experience of using the

12
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,340
product.
So your user experience,

13
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,780
you Ui,
Ux,

14
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:53,760
that's becoming more important.
Uh,

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,840
the interface is much more significant
than in the past.

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,080
Design is a more important element to
doc can feel.

17
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:02,640
Touch of products.
I mean,

18
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:06,360
my favorite example is the TV used to be
a big box.

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,340
You had hideaway in the corner of the
room.

20
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,000
Now it's something sleek,
almost like a picture you want to hang

21
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:15,330
up on the wall.
So we're seeing that we're seeing more

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,080
applications coming,
content and services delivered through

23
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,040
devices.
So a cell phone started off being about

24
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,070
just talking to people.
Now it's much more about the content and

25
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,830
services that you can get through that
device.

26
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,250
So that's really where we're going to
see in 2010 I think a big evolution,

27
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,100
which is now that now that all these
devices are out there,

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,430
we're going to see much more about the
service and the experience that's

29
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:48,990
delivered design or be more important
user interface will be more important

30
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,490
and all the kind of content that you can
get through these various devices.

31
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,220
Yeah,
it's right that the emotional feedback

32
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:04,221
is becoming much more important than it
used to be about a device for a devices

33
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:07,800
sake.
Now it's much more about what you can do

34
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:09,360
with that.
So what,

35
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:12,600
what does it do for me as a consumer?
And we think about the,

36
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,670
the experience of using that.
And so that's why we do a lot of

37
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:22,170
research now to really understand
consumer needs and consumer tastes and

38
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,830
unmet needs of consumers.
You know,

39
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,650
we've really evolved in the consumer
electronic space from being very

40
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:33,651
technology driven to being almost like a
consumer product or package goods

41
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:38,940
industry where it's really about how we
manage our brand and how we gain

42
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:43,140
insights about consumers.
So we have a big effort in terms of

43
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:48,141
market insights and consumer research,
which I had up here in North America to

44
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:50,880
get out there,
understand what consumers are looking

45
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:52,620
for,
what the unmet needs or not.

46
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,710
I'll give you one example which is to
move content between different devices.

47
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,470
So you know,
I was out recently taking photos,

48
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:04,570
you know,
family for those on vacation.

49
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,520
We get back,
I pull out the card,

50
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,940
put it into my pc and we all stand
around a 20 inch monitor looking at

51
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:16,780
these photos in the room next door
there's 55 inch tv.

52
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,520
That's where I want to watch the photos.
So we need to make it much easier to

53
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,640
move content between different devices,
big screens for certain content pieces

54
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:29,980
for certain content,
mobile phone for certain content.

55
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,420
So those kinds of insights that we can
get from the way in which consumers use

56
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:35,650
product.
A,

57
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,530
and also the things they want to do with
products.

58
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,360
That's where we can really get benefit.
