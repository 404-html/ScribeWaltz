1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,560
So consumer electronics has been amazing
growth industry for the last few years,

2
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:16,440
right?
We've seen this tremendous explosion

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,090
terms of digital TV's and people's homes
and mobile devices now,

4
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:23,490
people with two,
three cell phones,

5
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:26,520
other types of mobile devices.
We're seeing net books and so on.

6
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:31,290
So there's been this big growth of
devices out there and that's obviously

7
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:35,580
been a big part of Samsung that's rise,
but now what we see as more of a

8
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:40,581
transformation to consumer experience.
So it's less and less about the hardware

9
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:44,820
itself.
It's more about the emotional connection

10
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:48,180
with it.
It's about the experience of using the

11
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,340
product.
So you user experience,

12
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,680
you,
you are a ux that's becoming more

13
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:54,000
important.
Uh,

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,840
the interface is much more significant
than in the past.

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,070
Design is a more important element to
look and feel.

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,620
Touch of products.
I mean,

17
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,360
my favorite example is the TV used to be
a big box.

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,310
You would hide away in the corner of the
room.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,000
Now it's something sleek,
almost like a picture you want to hang

20
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:15,330
up on the wall.
So we're seeing that we're seeing more

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,050
applications coming,
content and services delivered through

22
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,040
devices.
So a cell phone started off being about

23
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,070
just talking to people.
Now it's much more about the content and

24
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,830
services that you can get through that
device.

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,880
So that's really where we're going to
see in 2010,

26
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:37,881
I think a big evolution,
which is now that now that all these

27
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:42,660
devices out there,
we're going to see much more about the

28
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:46,950
service and the experience that's
delivered design or be more important

29
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,150
user interface will be more important
and all the kinds of content that you

30
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:53,490
can get through these various devices.

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,230
Yeah,
it's right that the emotional feedback

32
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:04,231
is becoming much more important than it
used to be about a device for devices

33
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:07,810
sake.
Now it's much more about what you can do

34
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:09,340
with that.
So what,

35
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,620
what does it do for me as a consumer and
we think about the,

36
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:18,010
the experience of using that and so
that's why we do a lot of research now

37
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,530
to really understand consumer needs and
consumer tastes and unmet needs of

38
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:28,390
consumers know we've really evolved in
the consumer electronic space from being

39
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:33,391
very technology driven to being almost
like a consumer product or package goods

40
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:38,950
industry where it's really about how we
manage our brand and how we gain

41
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:43,150
insights about consumers.
So we have a big effort in terms of

42
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:48,151
market insights and consumer research,
which I head up here in North America to

43
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:50,890
get out there,
understand what consumers are looking

44
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:52,370
for,
what the unmet needs are.

45
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,370
Now I'll give you one example which is
to move content between different

46
00:02:57,401 --> 00:03:02,401
devices.
So I was out recently taking photos,

47
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,380
family photos on vacation.
We get back,

48
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:09,640
I pull out the card,
put it into my pc and we all stand

49
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:14,641
around a 20 inch monitor looking at
these photos in the room next door.

50
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:19,000
There's a 55 inch TV.
That's where I want to watch the photos,

51
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,100
so we need to make it much easier to
move content between different devices,

52
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:28,030
big screens for certain content,
pcs for certain content,

53
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,980
mobile phone,
for certain content,

54
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,390
so those kinds of insights that we can
get from the way in which consumers use

55
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:38,530
product a and also the things they want
to do with products.

56
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,360
That's where we can really get benefit.
