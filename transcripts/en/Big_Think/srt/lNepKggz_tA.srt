1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,630
I enjoy being a woman in science,
different fields,

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,090
what my field is one where I'm often
working with mostly men,

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,620
um,
but,

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,920
but there are more and more women coming
into science and I think that there's a

5
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:17,921
lot of issues around it.
I'm actually involve them in the

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,360
National Academy of Sciences Committee
for Women in science and engineering and

7
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:23,750
medicine and we spent a lot of time
thinking about what were the issues.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,090
Um,
and I think that there's very important

9
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:28,400
transition points that we need to focus
on.

10
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:31,880
So a lot of women will do sciences,
undergraduates,

11
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:35,380
but then fall out going to graduate
school and then there's a bigger follow

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,460
that happens to postdoc.
So why is it,

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,260
is there this attrition?
So,

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,900
you know,
really focusing on nurturing women

15
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:45,530
through their transitions.
Obviously there's a lot of cultural and

16
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:48,590
biological differences with women and it
makes it difficult because science is a

17
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:53,000
very challenging job and you do have to
make sacrifices and think about how can

18
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,630
you do it in a way that will work for
you.

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,040
So,
um,

20
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:58,851
yeah,
I mean,

21
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,340
I haven't,
I've enjoyed it and I think that in

22
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:02,330
general,
um,

23
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,000
people try really hard,
they're just cultural differences that

24
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:09,020
you have to understand and there's
things I have to reckon with personally

25
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,710
of how to do my science and be assertive
but still be,

26
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,110
you know,
kind and assertive and all sorts of

27
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:17,990
things and how to balance work and life
and all of that.

28
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:18,824
So,
um,

29
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,710
it's challenging and I think that
there's a lot that can be done.

30
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:23,210
I mean,
we definitely can.

31
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,300
I talk about in America that I feel like
I can't speak for the rest of the world.

32
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,000
I feel like in America there's lots of
opportunity for women in science.

33
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,840
It's not about the opportunity,
it's about motivating women to enter

34
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:39,230
science and a lot of the k through 12
education of getting them engaged

35
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:42,440
earlier on,
but then also supporting them,

36
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,450
you know,
supporting them through the transitions

37
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,740
because no matter what we say there,
so fundamental differences with trying

38
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:49,551
to,
you know,

39
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:51,650
with the things that you have to contend
with being a woman.

40
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,810
Um,
and so the opportunity is there,

41
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:55,760
it's just the support systems need to do
better.

42
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,770
I mean,
I think that,

43
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,990
you know,
it's a lot of people say,

44
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,820
and there's a couple of things,
a lot of people say,

45
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,733
um,
you know,

46
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,420
uh,
like asked me how it is that I do,

47
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,120
you know,
I have an md and a phd and do research

48
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:14,030
and also have an outside life and I'm,
but you,

49
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,070
no matter what,
there's 24 hours in a day.

50
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:17,840
So I don't like to pretend like,
oh,

51
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:20,120
it's just so easy.
Like you make sacrifices and,

52
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,313
you know,
um,

53
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,380
I wasn't being that healthy for awhile.
I've regrouped and been like,

54
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:25,700
okay,
now I have to focus and you have to

55
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:27,950
focus on the longterm.
So going to the gym,

56
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:31,250
doing the yoga and all sorts of things
that you have to do in order to sustain

57
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,980
yourself for your students and for
everyone.

58
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:35,180
So,
um,

59
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,890
there are challenges at every stage and
um,

60
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,090
it's easier to do when you really like
what you do.

61
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,440
So that's,
that's the important thing,

62
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:44,390
right?
Is the idea of liking it.

63
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:47,210
Even when you're failing,
it's failing in it and when it's hard

64
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,110
and just just liking it in general,
like you get a lot more energy and

65
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,470
everyone knows that you have these sort
of flexes of high energy and low energy

66
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:58,490
and if you can maintain yourself in a
place where you're always very focused

67
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:01,330
and energetic and excited,
then you can do a lot more.

68
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,190
Um,
and a lot of that comes with finding the

69
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:05,320
thing that's your passion.
So once you find your passion,

70
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,190
the day to day gets a lot easier.
So I love music and I would just do it

71
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:10,270
anyway.
Um,

72
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,870
so whether I was in a band or not,
like I write music all the time,

73
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:15,910
so it's easy.
It's not actually challenged in a lot of

74
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:18,160
times I'm embarrassed to say like write
songs,

75
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,570
like on my bike ride to work.

76
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,530
That's the kind of thing that I do
naturally and,

77
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:25,720
and engage in.
So it gives me time if I was to do

78
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:27,100
something that was totally,
you know,

79
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:30,490
write a book that's out of my field and
obviously that's a bigger sacrifice.

80
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,640
Unless it was something where the ideas
are just being for me and I was just

81
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:36,850
really engaged in the process,
so there is definitely challenges at

82
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:40,120
every stage of being active and keeping
it and sacrifices I've made.

83
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:41,010
Like I,
I've,

84
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,730
I'm,
I haven't started a family yet.

85
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:44,470
I'd like to,
but obviously the,

86
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,560
the,
when,

87
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,481
when,
and if I do,

88
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:49,150
that's going to be another thing to
bring into the mix,

89
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:49,840
which is challenging.
