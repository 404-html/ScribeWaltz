1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,601
Well,
I,

2
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:12,810
I can probably say the most about
healthcare because that's an area where,

3
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:13,670
um,
uh,

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,770
again,
a devoted in approximately last five or

5
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:19,320
six years,
it really intensively to kind of try to

6
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:22,540
understand the puzzle of how healthcare,
um,

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,040
and healthcare,
I think we have every opportunity to

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,830
truly
transform,

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,850
uh,
the value of patient in healthcare if we

10
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:40,560
actually are able to go back and step
back from the incremental changes to

11
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:44,880
what we have today and ask ourselves
what would it take for us to create a

12
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:47,370
dramatically higher value system.
So again,

13
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:48,240
I've,
I've written a lot,

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,810
a lot about this lately and,
and,

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,290
and,
and talk about it incessantly now,

16
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,610
but,
but you know,

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,541
things like,
you know,

18
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,380
just how you organize care,
uh,

19
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,300
uh,
things like how you measure success.

20
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,280
Uh,
these things are very,

21
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:03,540
very simple,
but you know,

22
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,950
our best guests,
uh,

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
uh,
is that we could get double the value

24
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:14,130
from the amount of money we're spending
today or we could get pretty much the

25
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:15,900
same value for half the money were.
I mean,

26
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:18,510
that's the order of magnitude of the
transformation.

27
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:23,400
And I'm very optimistic about healthcare
because I now see enough grassroots

28
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:28,401
bottom up effort and enough belief in
the basic framework of that,

29
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:31,080
that value is how we,
how we need to think and,

30
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:32,760
and,
and the patient's perspective is what we

31
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:34,350
should care about.
That I,

32
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:34,810
yeah,
I can,

33
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,300
I can see a line of sight to,
to a,

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,410
a healthcare system that will be very
proud of and it'll,

35
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,080
it'll lead the world and,
and it'll be affordable.
