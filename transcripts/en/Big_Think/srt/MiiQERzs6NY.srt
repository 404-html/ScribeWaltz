1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,980
I think what I've really been interested
in is I'm trying to make the government

2
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:15,960
work.
Uh,

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,580
I'm impressed with how big and how
complicated this country is.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,400
Uh,
when I graduated from high school,

5
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:26,070
we had 130 million people in the
country.

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:27,901
Uh,
today.

7
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:31,110
I don't know what the figure is,
but I think I saw a few months ago that

8
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:34,500
we now exceed 300 million.
In other words,

9
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,560
in my working lifetime,
the country has more than doubled in

10
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:39,000
size,
but much,

11
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:44,001
much more than that.
It is become extremely diverse as a

12
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:48,780
country and how you keep this country
together,

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,920
uh,
whether this nation so conceived and so

14
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:56,520
dedicated can long endure is Lincoln
said it got us Berg.

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,920
It,
that question was the operative question

16
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:02,910
that got us a bird.
It's still the operative question,

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,800
whether we can keep this country
together prosperous,

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,150
peaceful,
free,

19
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,190
uh,
is the challenge.

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,200
And my passion I guess has always been
to,

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,390
to see how I can contribute to making
the country work better.

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,480
Uh,
I think a lot of things in American life

23
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:29,481
and American society that a disturbing.
We have a marvelous country and,

24
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:32,490
uh,
we've been given a marvelous heritage,

25
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,190
terrific resources,
great opportunities.

26
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,120
And I don't know of anyone who lives
here who wants to live in another

27
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:42,120
country,
and I know millions of people who live

28
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:46,350
elsewhere who would like to come here.
So you begin with gratitude,

29
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:48,090
I think,
for what you have,

30
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,060
but you also have to recognize our
shortcomings.

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,300
Uh,
we have a political system today that's

32
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:59,301
not working very well,
just defeated an immigration bill.

33
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,770
We cannot figure out how to give
healthcare to everybody in this country.

34
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,910
Uh,
we have an education system that is

35
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:11,970
deficient in so many ways that,
uh,

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,960
constantly come to our attention.
The infrastructure of the country is

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,690
crumbling in many respects.
The institutions are not working as well

38
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:23,760
as we would like them to work.

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,370
So I think the challenges are immense.
Now,

40
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:31,200
I don't look at all of this and conclude
it's hopeless or I'm a pessimist or

41
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:34,500
anything of the sort.
But I do have a real sense of the

42
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:37,980
challenge.
And neither am I starry eyed optimist.

43
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,980
Uh,
you see a lot of people who,

44
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,190
who portray a kind of a false optimism
that is not based on fact really,

45
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,450
uh,
in,

46
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,640
in the problems that we confront.
So I just liked the traditional hard

47
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:56,040
headed,
pragmatic,

48
00:02:56,041 --> 00:03:01,041
old fashioned approach of Americans who
see their country in their community as

49
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:05,230
it is,
and they want to make it better.

50
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,350
But I don't see how any American can be
comfortable with our healthcare system

51
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,880
today.
Uh,

52
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,450
given the fact that so many of our
citizens are not covered here.

53
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:23,110
We have the most marvelous medicine in
the world if you can pay for it.

54
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,920
But so many Americans do not.
There's a janitor who comes to my office

55
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,273
and,
uh,

56
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,670
cleans it and,
uh,

57
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,920
he's a nice man.
Uh,

58
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,560
his teeth are falling out.

59
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,880
I go to the dentist,
uh,

60
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,140
I get a bill $500,
$1,000 for a routine checkup.

61
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,750
I can pay that fortunately,
and I can pay it for my family.

62
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,110
Here we are in the United States of
America,

63
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,640
richest country in the world,
and we can't get good dental care for

64
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:05,380
the janitor.
I'm disturbed by those things or take

65
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,850
education.
Today.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,490
I used to go to high schools,
give speeches.

67
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:13,480
All the times politicians do.
I'd look out over that high school group

68
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:18,010
and we'd had an interaction.
My fractions may not be right here,

69
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:20,590
but 50% of those kids I don't need to
worry about.

70
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,950
Uh,
they come from good homes.

71
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,670
They go to their churches,
they have good healthcare,

72
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,660
they're involved in their community.
They may not all be a students,

73
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:35,770
but they're doing well.
Many of them are a students and we're

74
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:37,180
not going to screw those kids up.

75
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,740
They're going to make it and they're
going to do well in life.

76
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,210
What bothers me is that other half.
Now,

77
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:50,470
there was a time when we were so good
and so strong and so powerful as a

78
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:52,960
country,
but we didn't really need to worry too

79
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:57,961
much about that other half.
But that's changing now and we've got to

80
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,660
begin to bring them up.
And that means the educational system

81
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:06,661
has to be sharply improved.
So I worry about these things and many,

82
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:11,590
many others who,
who can possibly be comfortable or

83
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:15,580
satisfied with the performance of the
United States Congress today.

84
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,830
I don't care whether you're a Democrat
or Republican,

85
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,860
we cannot solve the immigration bill.
They took up a bill.

86
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,540
Not wasn't a perfect bill for sure,
uh,

87
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,710
rejected.
But we,

88
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,920
we have a huge problem.
We can't solve it.

89
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,470
And these other things we haven't been
able to solve.

90
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:41,070
So I think we have a failure of
political leadership in the country.

91
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,470
And I don't put that in the context of
the George Bush presidency.

92
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,980
I put it in the context of the last
several decades.

93
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:55,981
This system is not working as well as it
should.

94
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,650
And I began this program,
I said that my interest was in making

95
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:04,100
the country work.
And it still is.

96
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,790
And I think the challenges ahead of us,
sorry man.
