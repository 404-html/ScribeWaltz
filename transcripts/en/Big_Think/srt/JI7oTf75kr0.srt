1
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,050
Important because it studies those big
questions I mentioned,

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,100
especially the big question of how
should I live.

3
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,750
Nobody can be indifferent to that.
Everybody needs to have an answer to

4
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:25,540
that.
But most people don't think about it

5
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:29,350
very much.
Most people live and think at the level

6
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:33,490
of a Dva or if they're really
thoughtful,

7
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:38,491
they move it up to magazines or
occasionally they'll read a book.

8
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,660
But behind all of those things,
above all those layers are the great

9
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:46,960
books,
the sources of the thoughts that are

10
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,220
developed,
elaborated and the trickle down to

11
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,640
yes.
That uh,

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,880
we wouldn't pay enough attention to the
daily necessities of life or the moral

13
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,050
virtues of,
uh,

14
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:14,370
living with others who aren't a
philosophers or political philosophers.

15
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:15,590
Yes.
I think,

16
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,760
uh,
that would be a narrowing and you might

17
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:23,761
even forget a thing or two by being so,
I'm so isolated or,

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,810
or,
or,

19
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,130
or so high above

20
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,680
most peoples,
we need to keep it

21
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,800
true to the great books,
to our tradition.

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,980
Our tradition is our substance.
Our tradition is a tradition of

23
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,040
questioning.
So it's not a stultifying tradition.

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,640
It's a tradition that keeps us aware.

25
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,680
Rake the lie.
