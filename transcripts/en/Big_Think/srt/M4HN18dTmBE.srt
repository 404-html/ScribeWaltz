1
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,410
Clearly,
a religion has both positive and

2
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:16,350
negative.
The wars of religion clearly negative,

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,850
uh,
uh,

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,630
the idea that you have to have something
to believe,

5
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:24,390
some things to think about,
a important,

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,870
obviously technological advances.
Uh,

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,310
I read a recent statistic which just
blew my mind away that,

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,510
um,
today the average American has 10 times

9
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:40,920
as much material resources as the
American at the Americans had it,

10
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:42,540
the civil war,
um,

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,180
which is just a phenomenal thing when
you consider,

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,110
and it's all because of technological,
scientific and Tuck,

13
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,660
the logical advances and the ability to
harness energy,

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,900
the ability to transform energy,
just phenomenal driver in society.

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,980
And again,
both positive and,

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,930
you know,
we have better killing machines to,

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,470
uh,
and uh,

18
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,980
so,
uh,

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,220
both of those things are,
uh,

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,940
I think phenomenally important.
And you know,

21
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:13,250
we didn't have much progress,
uh,

22
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,940
in terms of improvement in living
standards for a millennia until really

23
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:19,250
the development,
uh,

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,500
in the 16th,
17th century of science and the ability

25
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:24,480
to transform science into technology.

26
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,830
And,
uh,

27
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,520
sometimes I think we don't appreciate
the flush toilet enough.

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,910
It's just indoor plumbing,
indoor heating.

29
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:33,751
I,
uh,

30
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:38,310
in the late 19 seventies and early
eighties lived in Oxford in rooms that

31
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:41,670
had no central heating.
You had a heating coil and,

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,610
uh,
I think you get to appreciate central

33
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:48,260
heating and the fact that you can
actually live at 70 degrees all year

34
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:52,800
round a lot more when you are freezing
and you can't actually get to sleep

35
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:55,340
because you're shivering so much.
Um,

36
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:00,000
and I think that's just a phenomenal
thing we take for granted in our

37
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:03,030
society.
And it's been a very short time since

38
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,430
that's been.
