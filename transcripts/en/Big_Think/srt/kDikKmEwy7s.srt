1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,260
I can't think of a single issue that,
uh,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,980
democrats should draw.
W,

3
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:06,990
W,
which American be I usually Democrats

4
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:10,080
portray America,
the beautiful a should we say,

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,670
listen,
we don't care about American beautiful

6
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:13,740
anymore.
We're going to get in bed with the oil

7
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:16,890
spills and the clear cutters and the
mountain top removal and the people who

8
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:20,620
want to destroy America's beauty for
profit don't want to portray that value.

9
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:23,490
I taught my kids to sing the song.
I should probably stick up for it.

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,430
Which,
which American badge,

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,021
which we,
we,

12
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:25,854
we,
we try.

13
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,330
Uh,
you've got,

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,620
uh,
the Statue of Liberty.

15
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,180
May we just knocked that over a little,
a little mall there,

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,800
a little strip mall with Sasha.
Used to be so we can join the anti

17
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:38,740
immigrant crowd.
No,

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,220
the statue says,
give me your tired.

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,820
Give me your poor,
your huddled masses yearning to breathe

20
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:47,970
free.

21
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,760
If that sentiment was good enough for
our grandparents,

22
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,560
it should be good enough for our
grandchildren.

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,780
The color of the immigrants might
change.

24
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,860
Our national values should not change
that we are a nation of immigrants.

25
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:01,410
We should be respectful of the
contribution of immigrants.

26
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,860
And you cannot be an anti immigrant,
bigot and a Patriot at the same time.

27
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,960
Those are things that don't go together.
We're supposed to give that up.

28
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,720
We're supposed to give up the idea of
liberty and justice for all.

29
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,350
Okay?
We,

30
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,060
we believe in liberty and justice for
all.

31
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,030
Just not for the gay people.
You know,

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,820
just leave them out or you're not for
the poor urban black kids.

33
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,910
Leave them out.
We'll,

34
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:26,490
we'll give them a justice based on their
hoodies are wearing rather than based on

35
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,290
what they're actually doing is.
I mean,

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,920
which American value are we supposed to
betray?

37
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,760
Um,
I'm not going to betray any of them.

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,010
I think we should have liberty and
justice for all.

39
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,070
I think we should honor honor the,
not just a statue of liberty as a

40
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:41,160
symbol,
but as also the substance,

41
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:41,821
uh,
that,

42
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:44,220
that statue stands for.
I think we should believe in America,

43
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:47,190
the beautiful end offend America.
But I'm not willing to give up any

44
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:51,300
American values to appease people who,
if you gave up those values,

45
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:53,880
they would move 10 feet 10 more feet to
the right.

46
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,470
Anyway.
Anybody who

47
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:03,190
is in public life needs to find out what
they believe in and in public life will

48
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:06,150
test you.
You may think you know what you believe

49
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:08,460
in until you get put over those hot
coals,

50
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,590
the public life.
Some people believe that Americans just

51
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:13,220
as this land of,
of,

52
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,920
of,
of,

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,000
of individuals who have a lot of liberty
and she'd be left alone because how we

54
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:21,450
got so great,
I can't find any evidence that that's a

55
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:22,284
true story.

56
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,440
Best I can tell.
The American Century,

57
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,360
the last century when,
when everybody looks at with such awe

58
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,790
wasn't built by a bunch of random
individuals who didn't care about each

59
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,710
other and when do anything for each
other and the government that was

60
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:38,400
missing in action that was built by us
pooling our resources,

61
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,440
uh,
mainly through government,

62
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,720
massively investing in infrastructure,
public schools and dams and roads and

63
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:49,020
bridges and education.
Educating a whole generation of young

64
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:51,870
people at a level and scaled.
Never been done before.

65
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,730
Building a middle class.
It had a labor rights and civil rights

66
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:59,560
and women's rights to make sure that
middleclass could include more and more

67
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,960
people.
Making sure that we were no longer

68
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,570
poisoning the air and the water,
taking care of our children,

69
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,190
making sure that industry wasn't
poisoned,

70
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,300
killing our kids.
That is what made this great American

71
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:12,000
century that everybody's so off.

72
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,020
It wasn't just individual liberty or
just a market economic performance.

73
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,200
Lots of countries care about economic
growth,

74
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,020
but they have no environmental
protections in the labor standards.

75
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:26,110
That's not America.
America is a great country because we

76
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:29,350
perform well economically and meet those
standards,

77
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,610
but also we meet high environmental
standards and high consumer protection

78
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:36,480
standards and high civil rights,
Labor inclusions.

79
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,920
Here we are.
We're a worldclass across the board.

80
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:41,200
That's why people want to come here,
not just because we got to hire a big

81
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:43,360
GNP,
you'd have great gmp and have people

82
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:48,361
working as wet shops and have water and
the air poison that's not America and so

83
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,970
when you look at that as the kind of
country that we are,

84
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,800
then you say,
I'm going to defend that.

85
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,830
I'm going to defend my parents
achievements.

86
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,020
I'm going to defend my grandparents
achievements.

87
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,130
I'm not going to let people take a
wrecking ball painted red,

88
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:06,964
white,
and blue,

89
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,150
and smashed down every American
achievement for the last century and

90
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,050
call that patriotism.

91
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,720
In my view,
it's not patriotism in my view.

92
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:17,170
Patriotism and frankly being a
conservative would mean you would

93
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:19,990
conserve the achievements of our parents
and our grandparents.

94
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,840
They achieved the American Century,
the American middle class,

95
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:25,350
the American way of life.
It includes a,

96
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,980
an appropriately active government.
It also includes a dynamic private

97
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,720
sector.
It also includes community

98
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:34,180
responsibility and individual
responsibility,

99
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:38,580
but all of those together,
not just free markets and and,

100
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:39,100
and,
and,

101
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,950
and starved this America's government so
they can't do its job.

102
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,110
And so we have a responsibility,
I think,

103
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:46,450
to go forward and stand up for what we
believe in.

104
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,510
Whether we're running for office like
some are or whether we're not like

105
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:51,760
myself.
We have a responsibility to defend the

106
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:54,210
America that we inherited and to make
sure that,

107
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,670
that people calling themselves patriots
don't smash them.
