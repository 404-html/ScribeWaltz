1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,020
So what is a habit,
and I think the key thing about a habit

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,250
really comes down to decision making
because sometimes people think about

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,300
it's something that you do repeatedly,
you know it unfolds over time,

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,080
but really the key thing about a habit
is that you're not making a decision.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,820
You're not deciding whether to brush
your teeth,

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,030
you're not deciding whether to use the
seatbelt,

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,770
you're not deciding whether to go to the
gym first thing in the morning,

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,250
you've already decided,
and the advantage of a habit is that

9
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:29,700
once some things on automatic pilot,
then the brain doesn't have to use any

10
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:33,540
energy or willpower to make a decision.
You've already made that decision.

11
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:37,320
You're just moving forward.
And so it happens easily without any

12
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:38,610
thought,
without any willpower,

13
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:39,810
with any,
without any effort.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,110
You're just on cruise control.
And then you can do what you want to get

15
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:43,944
done.

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,340
How that is like the invisible
architecture of everyday life.

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,590
Research shows that something like 40
percent of what we do every day,

18
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:54,390
we do in pretty much the same way and in
the same context.

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,270
So it's easy to see that if you have
habits that work for you,

20
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,610
you're much more likely to be happier,
healthier,

21
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:02,220
and more productive.
If you have habits that don't work for

22
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:03,960
you,
it's really going to drag you down

23
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,470
because it's a big part of our days is
taken up by habits.

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,690
What are the mysteries of habit system?
Why do we persist in having bad habits

25
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:15,810
when we know they're not good for us,
when they know they don't make us happy,

26
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,150
but you know there's usually multiple
things going.

27
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:20,940
Maybe it's what you want right this
minute versus what you want on the

28
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,680
longterm,
or maybe you want to.

29
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:23,910
Things that are in conflict.

30
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,370
On the one hand,
you want to have plenty of time to hang

31
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:27,990
out and goof around.
On the other hand,

32
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:29,850
you want to have a clean,
pleasant department.

33
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,440
So you have two things that are in
conflict.

34
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,800
So when you have a bad habit,
it's very helpful to think very clearly,

35
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,550
what do I really want over the longterm?
What's what's really most important to

36
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:41,460
me?
And that can help you fight back against

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,670
the pole.
That gravitational pull that a bad habit

38
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,350
can exert.
One of the things people say about how

39
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:50,670
this sometimes is they're like,
make healthy choices and I completely

40
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:52,800
disagree.
Don't make healthy choices,

41
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:55,680
make one healthy choice,
and then no more deciding.

42
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,630
The reason that habits can give us so
much more power in our lives is that

43
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:02,520
they eliminate the need for decision
making.

44
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,110
You can just decide one time what you're
going to do and then you don't revisit

45
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:11,280
that decision because every time we make
a decision we have the opportunity to

46
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:14,340
decide wrong and even if we decide
correctly,

47
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,510
we still are using a lot of energy to
battle with that decision.

48
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,040
So you really want to use decision
making to set out a habit that you want

49
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,380
and maybe to anticipate a lot of the
challenges,

50
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:28,110
a lot of the stumbling blocks that you
might encounter along the way as you're

51
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:30,930
trying to form that habit.
But once you've made that decision,

52
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,770
don't look back the side once and then
no more deciding.

53
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,700
One question is whether you're better
off trying to do one habit at a time.

54
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:41,700
If you're trying to make change or
whether you do many all at once and like

55
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,000
many things with habit formation,
there's just no magic answer.

56
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:48,690
There's no one size fits all solution.
Some people do better when they start

57
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:50,940
small.
When they keep it very simple and they

58
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,060
gain the habit of the habit,
they get a feeling of accomplishment and

59
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:56,760
it's very manageable and realistic
because it's something very small and

60
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:58,800
it's just like one thing,
but on the other hand,

61
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:02,890
there are some who love to go big,
big transformations and big challenges

62
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,470
and so something to do is to think about
yourself and think,

63
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,240
well,
what have I succeeded in the past?

64
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:10,450
Or what appeals more to my nature?
And you think about what works for you

65
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,350
because there really isn't one perfect
way to change a habit or to change a

66
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:17,020
bunch of habits.
It really depends on what's going to

67
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:17,920
work for you.
