1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:11,020
When you sit down and observe your own
mind on purpose just for fun,

2
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,200
um,
as a kind of

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,550
scientific inquiry into
what drives you,

4
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,700
it doesn't take long.
Say if you

5
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,860
focus on say the breath is the object of
attention and you're riding on the way

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,480
as you're breathing.
It doesn't take long before you'll

7
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:40,481
notice that I'm some kind of want to
comes up some kind of desire and maybe

8
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:47,231
it's because your body is uncomfortable,
so maybe you just want to fidget a

9
00:00:47,331 --> 00:00:49,370
little or shift posture,
you know,

10
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:53,720
and just do it this way or that way.
And so very hard to sit still.

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,400
Why?
Because we're antsy.

12
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:58,940
Why are we answering?
Because we want to be comfortable and

13
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:01,880
we're not comfortable.
So rather than the holding the

14
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:06,850
discomfort
in awareness because why should we

15
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:08,530
privilege comfort,
comfort,

16
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:11,710
discomfort?
Because there is no ultimate comfort.

17
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,150
That's why we shift from one leg to the
other and we're always very shifty.

18
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,230
But if you actually train yourself to be
embodied,

19
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,380
you get less shifting.
I mean the mind just naturally settles.

20
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:27,340
The body naturally settles and you can
be comfortable

21
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,930
at home in your own skin,
but when you're not and you want

22
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:39,670
something,
we call that greed.

23
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,563
I mean,
it's like,

24
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,250
you know,
it's greedy at wants something now that

25
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,400
wanting to just be comfortable.
That's fine,

26
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:49,450
but when you start to watch the mind,
you'll notice that it's got a lot of

27
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:53,620
agendas on the greed spectrum.
I mean,

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,010
it,
it's an greed is not quite the same as

29
00:01:57,011 --> 00:01:59,410
ambition.
It has to do with greed,

30
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:03,640
has to do with more for me,
more of what I want from me.

31
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,970
Then there's this other thing that
you'll also notice,

32
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:10,120
which is you're sitting there and uh,
the opposite will come up.

33
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,180
What I don't want,
what I'm afraid of,

34
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,480
what I need to keep at the door.
Keep at bay to push a way.

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,690
And uh,
that's collectively referred to as

36
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,460
aversion or dislike or hatred.
You know,

37
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:32,461
when it's really strong and direct the
dolphin that other people or whatever,

38
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,940
you know.

39
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,180
So we've got greed on the one hand and
it is toxic.

40
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,290
The more you're sucked into greed,
the more go testicle you become,

41
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:47,800
the more it's all about me,
the more you're willing to sort of lose

42
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:52,060
your own ethical foundation to get a
particular result only to find that even

43
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:55,390
that results not really satisfying.
So you're onto the next result and it's

44
00:02:55,391 --> 00:03:00,391
a never ending trajectory.
But nevertheless have to admit it's here

45
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:01,900
all the time.
It's not like,

46
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:03,970
oh,
I've transcended greed,

47
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,420
you know,
I don't think we do transcend greed,

48
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,510
but we can transform how we are in
relationship to it.

49
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,000
And with awareness,
the greed doesn't have to run us.

50
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,720
And even if it's attenuated five or 10
percent,

51
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,030
wow.
That would be its own form of

52
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:20,710
liberation,
nevermind.

53
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:25,600
Thirty or 40 or 50 percent.
And the same with the aversion,

54
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:29,590
like what I don't want.
It's so bloody boring to sit here and

55
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,810
watch my breathing.
All right,

56
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,970
so what,
who thinks it's boring?

57
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,850
Uh,
have you looked at your boredom?

58
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,370
So have you looked at your aversion then
as soon as the you that's looking at

59
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:45,150
your revision,
that's more like awareness.

60
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,070
Awareness of aversion isn't diversive.
Awareness of greed isn't greedy.

61
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,790
So you're free already have those too,
toxic impulses.

62
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:58,290
Then there's another one which is like
the madness that passes for

63
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,570
the scenario in our heads and that's
often spoken of as illusion or delusion

64
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,160
that we're kind of like got these
completely half baked explanations about

65
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:17,400
everything and who we are and where
things are going and what's wrong with

66
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:22,401
the world and what's wrong with my
family and what's right and all of that

67
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:23,790
is Kinda.
None of it's true.

68
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,020
None of it's true,
but we believe it that that narrative

69
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:31,260
mode and that mind wandering default
mode network,

70
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:36,261
that's like my favorite pastime,
the story of me and it's diluted and it

71
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:41,751
also drains a huge amount of energy so
we can bring mindfulness to greed and

72
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:46,710
the greed can be attenuated or
liberated.

73
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,820
Mindfulness to a version and the version
can be attenuated,

74
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:55,680
deliberate or mindfulness to our own
diluted nature,

75
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,340
thoughts and emotions and so forth,
and that is liberating of them.

76
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,390
Then what do you have left

77
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,703
you

78
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,110
as pure awareness,
fully embodied what comes next?

79
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,360
I don't know.
You're writing the script.

80
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,010
It's not like,
oh,

81
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,380
then you'll feel this and you'll feel
that and you'll be enlightened and

82
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:21,150
everybody will bow down to you and you
know you will never have to have any

83
00:05:21,151 --> 00:05:26,151
kind of challenges or difficulty.
The full catastrophe will evaporate

84
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:27,230
forever.
No,

85
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,390
it'll be the same old,
same old,

86
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,520
only you won't be the same old.
Same because you,

87
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,530
oh,
you'll be the same.

88
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,470
You'll have the same bank account.
You'll have the same social security

89
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:42,630
number.
You have the same face in the mirror.

90
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,660
It'd be aging everyday,
but you will be in wiser relationship to

91
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:52,881
your possibilities
and to your embodied

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
enacted unfolding of those possibilities
moment by moment,

93
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,650
and that means life lived fully.
Wow.

94
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:11,030
You have a chance while we have the
chance,

95
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,950
as far as I know you didn't ask to be
born this pure gravy.

96
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,540
It's just a total gift.
Even with all the pain and suffering and

97
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:25,400
the trauma,
and I recognize the profundity of that

98
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:29,490
and the rendering quality of the still.
It's.

99
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,700
It's a gift and your gift and
silence in some sense at that point

100
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,680
becomes
wakefulness.

101
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,770
It's radiant,
it's luminous,

102
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,490
and it's already you.
