1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,080
This president is is really establishing
a tremendous legacy on the environment

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,190
as as well as the economy and I don't
need to speak to the economy.

3
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:13,100
Let me speak to my issues.
First of all,

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,510
I have been engaged since day one on
efforts to reduce carbon pollution.

5
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:21,530
Most notably in the car industry.
If you take a look at the cause of

6
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:24,860
today,
you have three times as many models for

7
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:29,861
sale today as you had when he took
office that are 30 miles a gallon per

8
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:32,600
gallon or more in terms of their
efficiency.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,330
That is because of actions of this
administration.

10
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:40,450
We are doubling fuel economy by 2025
we're doing that as a fuel economy

11
00:00:40,671 --> 00:00:42,920
standard and a carbon pollution
standard.

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,240
We have been looking at reducing toxic
emissions from utilities.

13
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,450
We actually put forward something that
looks at reducing mercury and arsenic,

14
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,110
things that we haven't been able to move
forward on and the result of that is

15
00:00:57,111 --> 00:00:59,600
that it's already past the compliance
period.

16
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,540
We never threatened reliability.
We got some,

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,640
some of those old inefficient units have
gone out that didn't have modern

18
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:10,550
controls.
Our communities are healthier.

19
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,010
We're saving up to 11,000 lives every
year ever was.

20
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,110
As a result of that,
we have renewables when three times as

21
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:21,920
much as when this,
when this president came into office 10

22
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:26,540
times more solar than we've ever had and
these are becoming competitive

23
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,960
technologies.
We have also have grown in the,

24
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:34,460
in the building trades in terms of how
you build energy efficient homes and

25
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:38,030
buildings.
We have grown thousands and thousands of

26
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:41,390
jobs.
We are building the the economy of the

27
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:46,391
future by building in your
considerations on environment into those

28
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:49,160
decisions.
We're looking at water rules today.

29
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,490
I am actually moving forward with a
final rule that is going to settle the

30
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:59,711
question of what waters are important to
protect so we can protect people's

31
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:04,190
drinking water into the future and how
do we adapt to a changing climate.

32
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,640
When you have California with such
significant water shortages,

33
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,090
what does that mean?
How do we change the way we do business?

34
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,600
And instead of piping water out,
we're looking at green infrastructure

35
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:19,010
moving in.
So we have a tremendous rich legacy that

36
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:22,820
this president is going to leave.
And I think climate is,

37
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:25,520
is really going to be the one that's
most talked about.

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,210
But frankly,
our legacy needs to be that we're nimble

39
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:34,211
enough as a government and as states
working with the federal government to

40
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:39,491
be able to see what the challenges are
today and to position our solutions in

41
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:41,830
ways that grow,
uh,

42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,230
our ability to tackle the problems of
the future.
