1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,170
I'm in the United States,
especially in the west,

2
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:13,171
generally we have a model of self where
the self is kind of like an avocado,

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,820
right?
And we have a pit inside of us.

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,820
I'm the pit is ourself,
our essence,

5
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:23,170
our identity.
It is a thing to which we must above all

6
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:24,450
be true.
Um,

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,140
and of course,
very importantly,

8
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:31,141
we've see that pit is unique so that
everything we do is we want to show to

9
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:35,140
reflect that pitch,
reflect that self,

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,290
and we want it to be unique in Asia.
The people frequently have a Flexi self,

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,490
so it's a different kind of self and it
is a self that's oriented more to duty

12
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,610
then to rights for instance.
And um,

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,470
and very importantly it is not,
it does not have,

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,830
have a cultural mandate to be different
and to be unique.

15
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,010
People in the east are not all alike,
you know,

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,791
so if,
you know,

17
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,590
if you looked at my family like,
believe me,

18
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:04,990
every single person is very,
very different.

19
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,330
And that is true of course,
throughout Asia,

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,680
you know,
the difference is not,

21
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:11,230
you know,
how different are we from each other?

22
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,880
The difference is how much significance
do we attach to that difference?

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,760
In other words,
do we think it's very important to,

24
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,610
to differentiate ourselves from others?
So if you asked him to other

25
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,340
individuals,
of course they're individuals,

26
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,510
you know,
are they different?

27
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,040
Of course they are different for the
course.

28
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:27,961
For them it's like,
oh,

29
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:31,260
of course I'm different.
Why would I make a big deal of that?

30
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,150
Right?
Um,

31
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,620
and they think it is very peculiar that
in the West that we feel that we must,

32
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,810
you know,
differentiate ourselves from others

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,930
endlessly.
So one of the ways that we do that,

34
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,560
of course it's through choice.
Choice in the West is very,

35
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:49,810
very important.
Everyone is always making choices.

36
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,070
And honestly,
Alana,

37
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:52,990
those choices make us a little anxious.

38
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,610
If you do a study where you are just
sitting in an empty room and you're

39
00:01:57,611 --> 00:02:01,570
making a choice and you come from a more
individualistic culture,

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,000
you actually show signs of a little
anxiety.

41
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:06,610
You know,
every little choice that you make,

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,020
even in private because it's,
it's defining who you,

43
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:15,150
who you are is a little loaded.
They feel like they just choose one name

44
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,290
because it doesn't have this overlay and
that's one of the reasons they feel that

45
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,350
actually we are less,
less free than they are,

46
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,960
you know,
so they think that we're the ones,

47
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,090
we're kind of in this prison where,
you know,

48
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,150
like I say,
every moment we must define ourselves.

49
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,080
Well,
it isn't that awful.

50
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,400
Right.
And,

51
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:34,234
you know,
of course the way,

52
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,780
the way that we live and we feel that,
uh,

53
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:41,880
you know,
we want to be freely electing to,

54
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,690
to live the way that we live.

55
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,300
Right.
And so even when we're doing things

56
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:47,134
like,
um,

57
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,870
taking care of the elderly,
for example,

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,030
you know,
we want to feel that we,

59
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:57,090
that is an extension of our great love
and the nature of our being to be able

60
00:02:58,781 --> 00:03:00,790
to care of the elderly.
Well,

61
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,530
you know,
the other day I was having dinner with

62
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:03,130
somebody said,
you know,

63
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,110
I just don't feel that and it's just,
it's just very,

64
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:06,490
very hard,
you know.

65
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:10,030
So somebody from a more flexi self or
interdependent culture was say,

66
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,650
you know,
it's just your duty,

67
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,900
you know.
And so for them it's like,

68
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,370
you know,
they held their elderly parents,

69
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,100
they just go take care of the elderly
parent because that's their judy.

70
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,500
For them,
this is really liberating.

71
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,750
You know,
you just go do it and you don't expect

72
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,650
there to do expression of yourself,
you know,

73
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,630
this is what people do from their point
of view.

74
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,560
We have made things very,
very hard for ourselves to demand that

75
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:35,110
you know,
that everything should be an expression

76
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,520
of our inner nature.
