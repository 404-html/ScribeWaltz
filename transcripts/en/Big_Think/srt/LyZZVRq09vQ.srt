1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,960
David blaine's plan was to spend 44 days
in a see through plexiglass box dangling

2
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:18,260
from a crane near London bridge
subsisting on nothing but water.

3
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,640
He called the endeavor above the below,
which some observers considered a bit

4
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:25,160
much.
The British were not impressed.

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,970
They were not impressed when Blaine
pronounces venture at the most extreme

6
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:33,350
exercise in isolation and physical
deprivation ever attempted or when he

7
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:35,210
said,
I'm a great artist.

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,710
Nothing more,
nothing less.

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,860
There were not impressed by the
multimillion pound deal.

10
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:43,910
He struck with Sky Television and there
were not impressed that he had decided

11
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:48,440
to confine himself to glass prison and
voluntarily starve when so many people

12
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:51,680
were actually incarcerated in real
prisons and actually starving.

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,640
The mayor of London said it was
disrespectful to the IRA members who

14
00:00:55,641 --> 00:01:00,641
died on hunger strikes in the 1980s
Blaine duly took his place in his box,

15
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,750
but the stunt totally backfired.

16
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,710
This is if it were the 18th century and
Blaine was in the stocks.

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,790
Crowns of cynical lenders gathered
underneath his box and laughed at him.

18
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,970
They pelted him with bananas,
French fries and eggs.

19
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,460
They made such a mess and his
girlfriend,

20
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,130
the unusually named German model,
Manon van Gherkin,

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,800
had to be cranked up on a crane to wash
the food to try this off the box with a

22
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:27,440
cloth.
We never had anything like this in New

23
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,273
York.
She said,

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,880
Blaine's helpers raise the box so it
would not be within egg throwing

25
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:34,700
distance.
A group of men position themselves on

26
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:36,950
tower bridge and tried to hit it with
golf balls.

27
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,810
A hamburger van pulled up below and
began ostentatiously frying onions and

28
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:44,480
other foods is enticing.
Aroma was designed to upset,

29
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:47,660
blame,
starving as he was a man tried to cut

30
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:51,080
off as water supply.
Some youth frightened him by shining,

31
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:52,670
lasered bends into his eyes.

32
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,000
A homeless person sat nearby behind a
sign saying,

33
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,470
please give generously.
I'm attempting 44 days on continuous

34
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,110
alcohol abuse.
Women took off their tops and flash

35
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:07,280
their breasts at Blaine.
Men pull down their pants and mooned

36
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:09,350
him.
People stayed up all night playing the

37
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:13,150
drums so this to disturb the tranquility
of anyone who might be trying to sleep

38
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,480
in an overhead box or radio station or
just listeners to stand in the cold

39
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:18,710
chanting,
Ding,

40
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:19,491
Ding,
Ding,

41
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:23,870
and then I'm noxious fashion.
Someone blasted the song living in a box

42
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:26,510
by the British pop funk group living in
a box,

43
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,160
a remote control helicopter buzz by
dangling a juicy looking cheeseburger on

44
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:34,130
a string.
There was unpleasant speculation about

45
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:37,470
Blaine's bathroom arrangements in
keeping with Britain's wellknown

46
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,300
lavatory obsessions.
Blaine's explanation of his plans for

47
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:45,260
his liquid waste that it would be
expelled by a to bleeding out of the box

48
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,390
had left a solid waste situation.

49
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,390
Deliberately vague adult diapers were
mentioned or radio host took to calling

50
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:56,390
Blaine nathey man.
Newspaper columnist speculated that the

51
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,040
illusionist had been eating on the sly
saying that they actually kind of fat

52
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,250
considering in the Sun.
Jane were referred to him.

53
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:07,810
Is that total twerp currently dangling
in a glass box above the Thames in the

54
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:09,460
Guardian,
Catherine Bennett said that the

55
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:13,570
satirical response to Blaine illustrated
the temperamental gulf between Britain

56
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:16,930
and America because Britain's know how
to tell the difference between a

57
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:20,920
huckster and a hero.
She urge Londoners to engage in a mass

58
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:23,290
public ridicule by taunting blend with
food,

59
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,940
even a blob of oily ice cream tastes
wizard when consumed in this suspended

60
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,380
company of the posture as close starving
Blaine,

61
00:03:30,381 --> 00:03:31,990
she said,
true.

62
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:34,780
He did have a supporters including
American tourists,

63
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,490
regular visitors who believed they had
telepathic communication with him and

64
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:42,190
that he was sending them special signals
from the box.

65
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,270
People who felt sorry for him and the
parent normalist Uri Geller,

66
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:48,530
who announced he is the quality of
respite.

67
00:03:48,531 --> 00:03:52,900
And when Blaine finally came down thin
and weak and with his major organs on

68
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:56,410
the verge of collapse or so,
he said the general feeling was that

69
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:58,960
above the below had been beyond the
absurd,

70
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,650
a huge pretentious failure.
But what was it that made ordinary

71
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:06,490
Britain's teas and resent him so much?
Because he was making such a big deal

72
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:10,570
about it because he had revealed himself
to be a puffed up self promoter rather

73
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:14,050
than the friendly kind of eccentric who
does what he does for himself rather

74
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:17,290
than for public acclaim,
news capable of going to the pub and

75
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,980
laughing at himself over a few pints
because he did not know when enough was

76
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:21,100
it.
