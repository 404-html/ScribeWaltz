00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,820
Dennis kucinich,
I grew up in Cleveland,

2
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:12,420
Ohio,
the oldest of seven children,

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,000
and my parents never owned a home.
Uh,

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,170
we were renters by the time I was 17.
We lived in 21 different places,

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,480
including a couple of cars.
Uh,

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,940
that experience of growing up in the
inner city,

7
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:30,180
which I've outlined in a,
in a book that I've just released called

8
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:35,181
the courage to survive is an experience
that really had an indelible imprint

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,450
upon the way I look at the world and
upon my soul because it,

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,810
uh,
it taught me compassion,

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,040
what people go through to just try to
make it day to day,

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,940
the importance of a job of a healthcare,
being able to put food on the table and

13
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:58,890
clothes on kids' backs.
The important of education,

14
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,520
um,
you know,

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,170
these are all things that are part of
people's practical aspirations and

16
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:07,290
having been riveted and that experience
growing up in Cleveland,

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,360
I understand as someone aspiring to be
president of the United States,

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,070
how terribly important all of these
things are for,

19
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,020
for,
for people.

20
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,910
So I'm,
I'm,

21
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,570
my worldview is truly shaped by that
experience and growing up.

22
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:32,820
And I know the whole world didn't live
in conditions that were near poverty and

23
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:36,480
I know that.
But I also know that those who do don't

24
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:38,400
have many spokes persons in government.
