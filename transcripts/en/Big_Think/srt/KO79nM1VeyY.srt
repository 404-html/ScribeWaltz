1
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,840
But we are engaging now in several
research projects.

2
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,750
We started out with a study in
Parkinson's disease,

3
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:21,810
so we're working with a bay area
Parkinson's,

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,990
a treatment center,
and they also have researchers there.

5
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,930
Um,
but the way that works is that if you're

6
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,060
a part of 23 and me,
you can fill out the online surveys that

7
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:32,580
we have and you can fill out any ones
you're interested in.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,850
And they're not just all really serious
research.

9
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:40,100
There are some fun surveys to fill out
about are you left or right handed idea,

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,490
blue eyes,
Brown eyes.

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,500
Um,
and some of these features that we hope

12
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:47,400
to also discover the genetics for which
there's so much to be learned.

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,530
Um,
so we're in the process of running more

14
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:50,970
and more of those research experiments.
