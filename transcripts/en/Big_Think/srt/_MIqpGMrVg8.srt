4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,660
I'm Alice Rivlin and I'm a senior fellow
at the Brookings Institution.

5
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,700
There are some quite obvious things that
companies can do a right now,

6
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,800
depending on what kind of companies they
are.

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,200
A,
if we're fixing our crumbling

8
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:41,430
infrastructure,
uh,

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,390
then,
uh,

10
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:44,490
uh,
companies that specialize in doing that,

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,760
uh,
will benefit if we're giving more people

12
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:49,590
access to broadband,
uh,

13
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,500
that is,
uh,

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,170
uh,
certainly,

15
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:54,960
uh,
an opportunity if we're making our

16
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:59,220
healthcare system more efficient.
There will be some people who will lose

17
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:00,550
by that,
uh,

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,910
but there will also be both,
uh,

19
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,260
providers and uh,
uh,

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,650
the,
uh,

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,600
uh,
healthcare,

22
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,920
uh,
technology industry that will benefit

23
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,760
the stimulus plan is,
I think,

24
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:24,620
widely misunderstood because people
think of it as just infrastructure.

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,740
It is partly that,
but,

26
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,560
uh,
the most important part of the stimulus

27
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:35,561
I thought were the parks that got money
to individuals so that they could keep

28
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,550
paying their bills.

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,270
Uh,
that means the food stamp part of the

30
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,650
unemployment benefits,
uh,

31
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,420
increase,
uh,

32
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,530
the modest increase in social security
benefits and the other part that seemed

33
00:01:55,131 --> 00:02:00,131
to me very important were the benefits
to states to keep them from cutting back

34
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,950
on their services.
So,

35
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,340
uh,
and I didn't even mention the tax cuts

36
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:12,341
which go to ordinary people and those
things will keep demand up.

37
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,220
It will keep a consumption up and it'll
benefit the businesses across the board.

38
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,580
There's no special benefit here.
It just means that people will not be

39
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:29,510
cutting back on their consumption as
much as they ordinarily would have.

40
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,770
We were bringing a lot of talent to Wall
Street that in my opinion would have

41
00:02:40,631 --> 00:02:43,690
been better employed doing something
else.

42
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,930
The financial services industry got way
out of kilter with the rest of the

43
00:02:51,281 --> 00:02:55,000
economy.
Financial services are supposed to be

44
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:58,630
serving the rest of the economy.
Actually,

45
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,840
our services industry got into a
position where it was largely servicing

46
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,740
itself.
We don't need that many smart people

47
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,930
inventing more and more complex
derivatives and instruments to sell to

48
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:15,150
each other.
Uh,

49
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,900
there is very little social benefit in
that activity.

50
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,190
Now,
I don't mean we can close down all the

51
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,590
derivatives markets or anything like
that,

52
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,783
uh,
but,

53
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,840
uh,
if compensation in financial services is

54
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:36,841
less astronomical and we attract less of
our high,

55
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,840
a high skilled talent into financial
services and more of it into other parts

56
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,540
of the economy,
it'll be all to the good.

57
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,140
This massive disaster,
uh,

58
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:58,170
has certainly exposed weaknesses in the
financial sector.

59
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,060
Uh,
some we knew were there,

60
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,530
many we didn't,
and we need a drastic overhaul,

61
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:10,531
I think on two fronts.
Partly it is a question of modernizing

62
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:16,591
our regulatory system,
which simply did not keep up with the

63
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:21,841
advances in financial innovation and
globalization that were happening all

64
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:27,841
around us.
That means a stricter regulation for

65
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:33,100
major institutions that are very
interlinked with the rest of the

66
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:36,190
economy.
And indeed with the global economy,

67
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,520
they can't be too strict.
We need those major institutions.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,880
The second front,
which I think is more important,

69
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,420
is we need to go over our economic
structure or economic architecture and

70
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:55,111
look for perverse incentives.
Places where there are incentives that a

71
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,120
meaning that people can make a lot of
money doing something really risky.

72
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,540
Now we had a good example of that in
mortgage lending,

73
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,060
mortgage lending standards got very lax
in part because we missed a perverse

74
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:15,874
incentive.

75
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,150
We missed the fact that the loan
originator has no reason to worry about

76
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:29,710
the credit worthiness of the borrower.
If he doesn't keep any of that risk

77
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:33,430
himself.
If he's just a selling this,

78
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:38,431
a mortgage to somebody else as part of a
package backing a bond issue,

79
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,780
then he has no reason to worry about
whether the borrower can repay.

80
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,170
That was a perverse incentive.
It had been there for awhile,

81
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,320
but nobody noticed it.
It was the big influx of capital into

82
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:57,601
the mortgage backed security market.
Lot of it coming from that exposed this

83
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,960
weakness and we have to look for things
like that and change them.

84
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,210
I think that President Obama has to work
right now on the thing that is most

85
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:18,240
important,
namely getting out of this recession and

86
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:21,840
getting the financial services industry
functioning again.

87
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,890
If he doesn't accomplish that,
and I think he will,

88
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,420
it will be a disaster for business.
Uh,

89
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:34,230
we need a functioning economy where
people have jobs.

90
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,650
We need to be a more sustainable economy
than we were before,

91
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,880
both in an environmental sense and um,
in the sense that we need to save more

92
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,290
and finance more of our own investment
out of domestic saving.

93
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,850
I think that will happen because people
who borrowed too much and consumed too

94
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:03,570
much got badly burned.
But we need an economy which is

95
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:07,890
functioning well and in which people are
saving more,

96
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,620
borrowing less and uh,
doing more productive
