1
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,450
It's a good question.
Uh,

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,780
and it's a little bit about our history.
You know,

3
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:16,190
we've,
we've become so disassociated with

4
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:18,380
agriculture,
both with the culture of agriculture.

5
00:00:18,381 --> 00:00:21,980
I'm with agriculture itself.
We are one generation and in some cases

6
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:26,780
two generations removed from that.
And as you get more and more removed

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,470
from how food is grown,
who's,

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,450
who's growing it,
where it's coming from,

9
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:34,320
how it's getting to you,
uh,

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,900
the easier it is to be completely
disassociated from the decisions about

11
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:39,980
all those things.
So,

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,400
so I think part of my job and part of
the job of stone barns is to say,

13
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:44,234
Hey,
wait a minute.

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,360
This is part of the pleasures of living.
And these are decisions that are being

15
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:52,070
made every day by farmers all around the
country and all around the world.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,940
And we need to buy into this thing.
So as an eater you have a kind of

17
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,200
responsibility.

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,570
And for some people like chefs,
I think it's a greater responsibility

19
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:00,800
for other people like eaters.
It's just,

20
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,210
it's an everyday thought process to,
to put your money where your mouth is

21
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:07,790
and to understand that you're voting.
Look,

22
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:11,150
we're in a political season and we say
we vote every once every four years.

23
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:14,680
And so many people get frustrated that
their vote really has no say and Dah,

24
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:15,170
Dah,
Dah.

25
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,630
Well,
this is an opportunity three times a day

26
00:01:17,631 --> 00:01:21,530
to vote with your fork and two,
to make a huge impact on,

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,540
on how people think,
uh,

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,010
uh,
about,

29
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,090
uh,
uh,

30
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,040
supporting food and how food is grown.
And that,

31
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,730
that seems to me to be a very positive
message.

32
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,561
Uh,
and,

33
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:33,350
and it's,
uh,

34
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,930
it's one that that could lead again
with,

35
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:37,190
with,
with the flavor,

36
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:39,920
with the potential for real pleasure.
Uh,

37
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:41,720
and,
and I think people are turned on to that

38
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:43,160
and excited by that.
And,

39
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:44,450
and,
and we're just,

40
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:46,970
we're just starting to feel this,
this wave of interest,

41
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:49,340
which hopefully will translate into
things like,

42
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,980
like new political reality.
