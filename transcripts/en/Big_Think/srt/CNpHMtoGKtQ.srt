1
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,500
We focus on the

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,250
and a turmoil when we focus on the
places where we're bombs are going off,

3
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,970
but I'm sure this will be remembered as
a golden age.

4
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,170
Another thing just,
it was 1994,

5
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,980
around 90 to 94 when the Internet
started to take off.

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,260
It's only been a little bit more than a
decade.

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,910
We almost can't imagine a time when we
couldn't communicate for free with

8
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,820
anybody in the world.
And yet that's the world we're living in

9
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,310
today.
So it's,

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:40,761
you know,
it's,

11
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:42,610
it's,
it's truly a golden age and the,

12
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:45,240
in the sense that the world has become

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,640
single place.
