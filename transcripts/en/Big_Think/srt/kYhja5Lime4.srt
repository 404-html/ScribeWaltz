1
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,710
I think what,
what we have done at the college board,

2
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:15,590
if I could explain just a minute about
what the college board is,

3
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:18,800
because people somewhat kind of confused
about what we are,

4
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:21,860
what we,
what we are is first is that we're an

5
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:25,370
organization that is preparing kids to
go to college.

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,130
We have this,
we have standards of what you need to

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,830
doubt to go to college and be
successful.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,210
We have curriculum from the sixth grade
to the 12th grade and math and English.

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,900
We have the AP program,
which is 37 subjects.

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,140
So we have a standard,
we have standards and we have,

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,210
uh,
programs that allow that.

12
00:00:47,211 --> 00:00:50,860
We prepare kids to go to college.
So we used to be just a,

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,000
uh,
individual programs.

14
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:58,001
Now we're a system of programs that we
can prove that we can really improve

15
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,490
performance significantly and either a
state or school district or in school.

16
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,810
So that's,
that's part of what we do.

17
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:08,240
The other,
the second part is how do you,

18
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,660
how do you,
how do you affected the admissions

19
00:01:11,661 --> 00:01:12,590
process?
So,

20
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,700
not only do we provide the sat to
colleges and schools and students,

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,020
but we also do a lot on financial aid.
We do a lot of admissions.

22
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:24,180
Part of that's training center that's
programs to help administered.

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,810
And the third thing is we have a program
of,

24
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,360
of uh,
of innovation in research.

25
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,750
That's the newest part of the college
board began about three years ago.

26
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:35,840
We do studies on,
on how you can improve community

27
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:37,340
colleges,
how you can employ,

28
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,790
prove writing,
how you can improve the process of

29
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,790
getting more students prepared and ready
to go to college.

30
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,000
So that those are the three parts of
the,

31
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:51,440
of the College Board.
And I think that in Time magazine says

32
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:54,230
what they did.
It shows that we're trying to make an

33
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:58,070
impact,
a substantial impact from preparing kids

34
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:00,230
to go to college,
to the,

35
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,180
the process,
the process of,

36
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,880
of,
of entering college and,

37
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,470
and then looking for ways that we can
improve the whole system by,

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,150
by innovation and research.

39
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,290
collegeboard.com was really begun,
um,

40
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,740
really at the sort of the hyper,
the inner internet back about almost as

41
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:26,160
an been almost nine years ago.
And uh,

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,600
I wanted,
when I came to the college board,

43
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,590
one of the first things I did was to
create collegeboard.com cause I wanted

44
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:36,700
us to be on the cutting edge.
And it's been a really critical part of

45
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:39,220
the growth and expansion of the,
of the cause.

46
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:41,650
But when I went to the college where we
had about 400 employees,

47
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:43,600
we now have about 1200 employees.
We've,

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,010
we've,
we've,

49
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:45,550
we've,
uh,

50
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,120
we've almost tripled what we've,
what we do today from what we did in

51
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:53,140
part of that was because we had the
ability to communicate to kids through

52
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:54,550
the,
to students,

53
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:59,110
through the Internet system.
So I think it's been a very important,

54
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,500
it's something that we continue to
upgrade.

55
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,700
It's a,
it's a,

56
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,020
it's a,
it's a,

57
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,980
it's a,
it's a good service for parents and

58
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,500
students to better,
better it,

59
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,910
to sign up to get information.
It's,

60
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,060
it's,
it will become a bet bigger and more

61
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:21,370
important thing for teachers to get
information.

62
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:24,760
And other educators to get information.
So I think it's,

63
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:25,241
uh,
it's,

64
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:27,850
it's,
it's highly used.

65
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,680
Uh,
I think it's probably the,

66
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:33,250
by far the busiest education website in
the country.

67
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,210
And,
uh,

68
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,940
it's given us a chance to speak to
students,

69
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:41,110
parents,
and teachers and educators in a much

70
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:43,320
more effective way than we could have if
we hadn't had it.
