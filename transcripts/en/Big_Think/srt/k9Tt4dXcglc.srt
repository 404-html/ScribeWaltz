1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:10,530
Other people can learn from writer's
life many things because La la writers'

2
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:14,420
lives are so different.
Some are processed.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,790
It's something that comes from outside.
Some our process with their visions

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
likes of me are different.
I work like a cloak and then also my

5
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:30,271
books are more like frescoes and epic,
so I start from a corner and continue

6
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:36,631
and continue without even knowing what
the final picture will be in the end.

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,120
40 years of devotion to the art of the
novel taught me one thing that is to pay

8
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:46,420
attention to people's lives,
to pay attention.

9
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:51,450
What you wrote here about people's lives
this now as strange as in my mind is

10
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:57,721
based on interviews that I did with lots
of people that that also taught me to be

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,500
modest about people's life and play
around with the details of their lives

12
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,920
til it really sounds more real than
reality.

13
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,270
Most of my life,
I did not have a proper editor since I

14
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:17,020
was writing in Istanbul.
I am my own editor,

15
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,710
but the secret of writing is the right
thing.

16
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,350
Self editing,
editing,

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,440
leading to your beloved ones,
to your wife,

18
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,310
to your daughter.
To Your partner and hearing the story

19
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,430
from other people's point of view.
Never giving up your high standard of

20
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,560
criteria of good writing,
but continuing on and on and on and on,

21
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,430
and editing and editing and care taking
out,

22
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,510
no matter how much time you gave to that
beautiful page,

23
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,060
perhaps that can also be cut out.
