1
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,390
Philanthropic investor and I invest
primarily in

2
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,450
early childhood education and services.
I've

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,040
spent quite a bit of time and money on
the subject of early literacy.

4
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,010
Uh,
what I did in my business career,

5
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:30,860
I would describe as I applied systems
solutions to large business problems.

6
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,220
I was in the early days of Federal
Express building.

7
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:40,170
I was the chief information officer back
then after I had left IBM and other

8
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:42,930
private businesses and I was,
did that for a while,

9
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:45,400
building the worldwide trade shipping
tracking system.

10
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:50,250
And then I was chief operating officer
of Federal Express for about 10 years,

11
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,790
uh,
implementing lots of systems,

12
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,640
aviation systems,
computer systems.

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,320
So I learned a great deal
from that experience.

14
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:06,030
Then I went and ran a largest,
then the largest solar company in the

15
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:08,010
world,
and mccaw cellular out of Seattle.

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,850
Uh,
we sold that to a t and t and became

17
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:15,240
chief executive officer of at and t
wireless back in the early nineties.

18
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,990
Uh,
and then I left that at the behest of

19
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:22,320
some people who are now great friends of
mine to go with a little startup.

20
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:27,090
I figured one more bite at the apple,
so I went down to Palo Alto and mountain

21
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:31,380
view California and became the chief
executive officer of a little startup

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,090
called netscape communications,
and we taught the world how to use the

23
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:39,410
Internet with the browser.
And then we sold that to aol in

24
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:40,231
[inaudible] 99.
And,

25
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:43,290
uh,
that's when I basically retired from

26
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:46,260
active business.
Went on the Time Warner Board.

27
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,750
Uh,
I'm on several boards,

28
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:53,520
both public and private.
I'm chairman of the board of the Mayo

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,353
Clinic,

30
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,060
Rochester,
Minnesota,

31
00:01:56,061 --> 00:02:00,670
and on other private boards interested
in healthcare and human service.
