00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,150
Hey Bill,
my name is Thomas and I'm from Los

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:07,811
Angeles,
California.

3
00:00:07,811 --> 00:00:11,320
And I was wondering if mathematics is
truly universal.

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,770
I'm not disputing it.
I'm just really wondering if,

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,490
uh,
mathematics such as calculus a really

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,870
like a,
it's the same near the edges of the

7
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:25,660
universe for all that we know,
or,

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,430
um,
like near black holes.

9
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:29,990
Does Matthew do mathematical laws?
Uh,

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,680
breakdown?
Uh,

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,673
thanks

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,430
Thomas.
That is a great question about

13
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:39,210
mathematics as far as we know,
it works everywhere.

14
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,380
You know,
whatever,

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,650
if we go to a place,
as you suggested,

16
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:47,100
near a black hole,
the edge of the universe and mathematics

17
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:50,010
doesn't work.
We would say to ourselves,

18
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:51,720
well,
there's just mathematics that we don't

19
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:54,420
understand.
We have to add some more,

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,610
more math to our,
uh,

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,770
to our,
uh,

22
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,910
Kennan of mathematical equations.
It's very reasonable that there's math

23
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:09,780
that nobody knows how it works,
but just understand that when it comes

24
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:14,781
to the motion of planets,
when it comes to how rockets work,

25
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:19,470
when it comes to the paths of comets and
asteroids and meteors,

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,800
we understand this stuff inside out.
However,

27
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,120
it was only in the 16 hundreds that
these discoveries were made.

28
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,290
And so,
uh,

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,700
you'll also hear people talk all the
time about the singularity,

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,660
the singularity.

31
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,210
And this is to me,
is when you get one over zero and one

32
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:43,560
over zero is infinite,
or it is unknowable.

33
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,420
And I'll give you an example.
Uh,

34
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,320
what's,
what's 1000?

35
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,330
What's bigger?
One 10th or 1000th a 10th is bigger than

36
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,520
a thousandth.
Okay.

37
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:57,390
Then,
uh,

38
00:01:57,391 --> 00:02:02,391
what's bigger?
1000th or one 10000th a thousandth has

39
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:05,130
bigger.
All right.

40
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:10,131
Now what about one over one 10000th
that's 10,000,

41
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,460
but at one over 1000000th is 1,000,001
over a billion visibility.

42
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:19,440
So as the number gets smaller and
smaller,

43
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:22,170
that total the inverse,
the,

44
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:24,060
uh,
the,

45
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,220
uh,
denominator causes the total,

46
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:30,540
the quantity to become a bigger.
And so if it's over a zero,

47
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,520
it would become infinity or infinite.
And nobody knows what happens at

48
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:38,220
infinity.
No one knows what happens exactly at the

49
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:39,500
singularity.
Oh,

50
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,670
people speculate.
Oh.

51
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:42,991
Uh,
but yeah,

52
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:45,150
as near as we can tell,
math applies everywhere.

53
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,070
That is a great question.
Thank you.
