1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,683
Okay.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,100
I can think of a couple of people,

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,053
mmm.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,730
Who are sort of,
um,

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,030
part of my world,
but not exactly,

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,633
uh,

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,420
interesting question because a couple of
those people I already did talk to.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,513
MMM.

9
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,500
I think I'd like to interview this,
the Rock Star born Bano

10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,720
I'm interested that he,
uh,

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,850
it still functions as a musician,
but has this,

12
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:11,410
uh,
idea of this,

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,120
of turning his global access into some
kind of an influential thing fascinates

14
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:17,210
me that he wants to do that.

15
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,743
MMM.

16
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,100
I guess for a very different reason.

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,593
MMM.

18
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,310
I'd like to interview my favorite soccer
player,

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,910
Alfredo brazy.
It's been retired for about 10 years.
