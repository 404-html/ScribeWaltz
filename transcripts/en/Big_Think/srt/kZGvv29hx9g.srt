1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,620
Every form of spirituality we can
identify whether it's traditional

2
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:11,250
religious forms of spirituality,
a kind of a materialistic,

3
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:16,251
scientific worldview or progressive
spirituality in all its many phases as

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,450
in the last 50 years that have emerged
within American culture and elsewhere

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,710
have both dignities and disasters,
right?

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,460
The spirituality brings out the best and
the worst in humanity.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,340
And so every one of these major
categories,

8
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:33,390
the,
the religious,

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,530
the secular and the progressive have
very beautiful and important

10
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:40,920
expressions.
And they also have dark expressions,

11
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:45,300
which we do well to avoid.
And I certainly feel that scientology is

12
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:49,110
a dark expression of progressive
spirituality or maybe even secular

13
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,050
spirituality.
It's not really clear how to categorize

14
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:52,950
it,
but,

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,250
uh,
it is a cult and we see cults of all

16
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:58,230
kinds.
Whenever you're dealing with something

17
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:02,280
that's ultimately true and real,
there's people can go astray.

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,670
They can be pulled into forms of
organization,

19
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:06,760
which are,
uh,

20
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,060
uh,
diabolical.

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,850
I had in the signs of a cult include,
uh,

22
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,260
um,
uh,

23
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:17,220
particularly strong personality who
wants everyone else to conform.

24
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,440
Um,
it,

25
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,620
it can include,
um,

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,640
intense commercialization in which it
seems more like a business than a form

27
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:25,550
of spirituality.
Uh,

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,520
I think that the best way we can protect
ourselves on the spiritual journey is by

29
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,750
taking an integral view of spirituality,
is seeing how spirituality evolves and

30
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:42,900
seeing how it can become stuck,
how it regresses.

31
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,930
And so if we look at scientology,
we can see that there's a lot of

32
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:48,360
negative fruits.
A lot of lives have been ruined,

33
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,340
a lot of false hoods had been projected.
And so using this test of their fruits,

34
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:56,820
we'd be able to determine right away
that that's the kind of spirituality we

35
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:59,790
would do well to avoid.
Ultimately,

36
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:02,520
I think spirituality is a,
is a personal affair.

37
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:05,640
And while we can socialize our
spirituality and be part of a spiritual

38
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:08,610
group,
the spirituality in its essence is

39
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:12,180
really about our own spiritual growth
and our own experience of that,

40
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:14,460
which is beautiful,
true and good.

41
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,020
And so,
uh,

42
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,140
uh,
maintaining our,

43
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,120
our prerogative as agents of evolution
and as indeed agents of our own

44
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:28,980
spiritual growth is one way we can
protect ourselves from,

45
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,630
uh,
the ways that we can be led astray in

46
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:32,070
the spiritual marketplace of ideas.
