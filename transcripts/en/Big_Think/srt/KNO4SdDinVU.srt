1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,690
There've been three big changes in the
family in the last generation.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,790
First,
the definition of the family has

3
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:08,430
changed.
So we now have adoptive families,

4
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:11,610
blended families,
nuclear families living in separate

5
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,160
houses and divorced families living in
the same house.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,130
Also,
we have women have flooded into the

7
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:19,680
workplace.
Two thirds of women now work outside of

8
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:21,900
the home.
And the last thing which we don't talk

9
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:25,290
about as much is that men have come
flooding into the parenting space and

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,440
dads are much more involved in families
and I think this new generation of

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,080
parents,
because they are much more active and

12
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:38,340
much busier technology work,
etc. They're much more interested in

13
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:40,980
solutions so that the old debates be
strict,

14
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:44,460
like the Chinese are blacks,
like the French are no longer satisfying

15
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,140
for them.
They want results,

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,900
they want to know what works and they
want to be able to do it in their

17
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:49,734
families.

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,100
I'm the father of identical twin girls
and my wife works and we were incredibly

19
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:58,170
chaotic.
We just felt lost and out of control.

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,980
We would turn to our parents,
but their experience was so outdated as

21
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:04,410
to be almost quaint.
We'd facebook our friends,

22
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:09,411
but they're just as clueless as we are
and then we went looking for results and

23
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,570
the traditional solutions just seemed
very tired and out of date and yet at

24
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:19,650
the same time that these family experts
were telling us the same thing over and

25
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:22,980
over again in every other area of
contemporary life,

26
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:25,590
from business to sports,
to the military,

27
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,390
there's all these new ideas about how to
make teams and groups work more

28
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:33,690
effectively and so I wanted to go out,
find out what those folks were doing in

29
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:38,040
their homes and then test those ideas
out with my own wife and kids and my

30
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,170
wife put one red line in the sand.

31
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,010
She said,
okay,

32
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,500
I'm willing to try new things.
I'm desperate,

33
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:45,840
but I don't want theory.
I don't want some academic telling me

34
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:47,760
what to do.
I want to know that real families,

35
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:50,820
we're actually doing these real things
that I'm willing to try.

36
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,420
There is this idea about families that
exists,

37
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,910
no place else.
We have our jobs,

38
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,460
we work on those.
We have our hobbies,

39
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,130
we work on those.
We have our bodies,

40
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,130
our relationships.
We work on those somehow.

41
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:08,130
There's this idea that that families are
just supposed to be,

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,710
it's supposed to be organic,
that kids come with their own

43
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:14,970
instruction manual or something,
but every parent I know doesn't feel

44
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:17,190
that way.
We feel like our lives are out of

45
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:20,490
control and if I could put it in one
headline,

46
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:24,660
I would say that as a parent I felt like
I was always playing defense and never

47
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:28,890
playing offense and yet there's all
these new ideas out there.

48
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,690
So if that's where the action is,
if the action is in business or in

49
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:37,350
sports or in some place else,
let's bring those ideas in.

50
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,390
If your family doesn't have this
problem,

51
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,310
fine,
don't take these solutions.

52
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,860
I'm sort of not wagging my finger and
telling people what to do.

53
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,020
I'm saying that we were desperate for
new ideas.

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,500
I went founding them and I found a lot
of them in unlikely places.

55
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,590
When I sat out working on the secrets of
happy families,

56
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:56,790
I made a vow to myself that I wouldn't
squeeze everything into a list of three

57
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,830
or five or seven things that you must do
to a happy family.

58
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,140
I'm up at you,
but I hate those lists.

59
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,270
I forget number two,
I disagree with number four and I feel

60
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:07,810
like I'm doomed.
One of things I tried to do was to put

61
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,220
200 new ideas in this book because it
would be very obvious that nobody could

62
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:16,090
do them all,
but if you pick three or five or seven

63
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:17,860
that works for you,
and it might be different than what

64
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:19,570
works for me or what works for my
sister.

65
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,640
I think you can have a happier family,
and to me the biggest takeaway is you

66
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:28,840
don't need some master plan.
You don't need some big new scheme

67
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,940
that's going to be hard to set up and
impossible to follow.

68
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,960
You need to take small steps and
accumulate small wins.

69
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,300
What's the secret to a happy family?
