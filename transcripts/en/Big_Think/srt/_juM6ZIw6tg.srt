1
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,620
I became involved with the conservation
work and,

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,483
uh,

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,050
through that,
um,

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,310
Dr Wilson's Biodiversity Foundation,
which aren't,

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,460
I'm on the board of,
because it was clear to me that,

6
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:27,200
uh,
that,

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,790
uh,
mankind,

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,820
human activity was degrading our earth's
resources at an alarmingly rapid rate

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,180
and that we were losing species,
um,

10
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,750
right and left important species
perhaps.

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,600
Uh,
in some cases we knew in other cases we

12
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:49,660
hadn't yet,
um,

13
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,970
full knowledge of a species or an
organism before it was lost.

14
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:01,630
It's my understanding that that much of
a much of our medicine,

15
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,890
much of our food stuff that may be
required in the,

16
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:12,740
in the future will come from these
reserves of biodiversity,

17
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,980
which are rapidly disappearing.
Um,

18
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,130
and unless we have a fully,
um,

19
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,680
uh,
protected,

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,490
uh,
uh,

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,270
bio,
uh,

22
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,100
systems,
uh,

23
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:31,790
we will not,
we'll lose the potential to learn how

24
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:36,320
nature works.
And that information may be critical in

25
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:39,290
our understanding of how to manipulate,
uh,

26
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,210
um,
what is in our power to manipulate to,

27
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,290
to save biodiversity,
save,

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,130
uh,
the power of our,

29
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,210
the

30
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,920
planet to sustain life.
