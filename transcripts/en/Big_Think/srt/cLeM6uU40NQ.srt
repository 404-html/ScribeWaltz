1
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,290
Women entrepreneurs currently are
getting about 2.5% of all venture

2
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:12,510
capital and it's not the only source of
funding,

3
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:15,990
but it's a really great indicator of how
we fare in space.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,590
And that's a fairly commonly understood
statistic.

5
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:21,960
But the statistic that I like to
feature,

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,740
which is the one that nobody ever talks
about is what percentage of funding is

7
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:29,040
actually going to women of color.
Um,

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,940
and that's a much more dismal number.
That's actually depending on what study

9
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:36,720
you look at,
it's between 0.1% or 0.2% which is to

10
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:41,721
say that women of color and companies
founded by women of color aren't really

11
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:44,430
even statistically relevant at this
point.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,090
The fact that women of color and
companies founded by women of color

13
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:53,091
don't really even play in the space is
particularly jarring if you think about

14
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:57,060
the fact that most companies in this
country are actually founded by women of

15
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:57,810
color.

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,480
So it's bad that we're not getting
funding,

17
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:03,870
but it's particularly bad given that we
seem to be the source of innovation.

18
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:08,670
And probably the most entrepreneurial
community of all venture capital is,

19
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,730
I often call it like the house flipping
version of investments,

20
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:16,290
right?
Like house flipping shows.

21
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,870
It has become the most popular,
the most visible,

22
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:22,950
the most sort of prolific version of
investing that's out there or even of

23
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:25,740
capital sources,
but there's way more to the world of

24
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:28,740
investing and of securing capital than
just venture capital,

25
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:30,060
right?
There's long view investments,

26
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:32,730
there's debt,
there's crowd funding.

27
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,670
There are many different options when it
comes to getting funding,

28
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:38,760
but the one that dominates the headlines
is venture capital.

29
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,320
You get to be on the cover of things.
When you secured a big series a,

30
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,470
you don't really get a whole lot of
price when you've secured a line of

31
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:47,790
credit or alone.

32
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,130
It's just not perceived as sexy.
And yet companies need debt in order to

33
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:57,090
be successful.
Companies that are women led tend to be

34
00:01:57,091 --> 00:02:01,020
more successful at getting crowdfunding
dollars than they are at getting venture

35
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,110
capital dollars.
So in these areas of funding that don't

36
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:07,680
get a lot of publicity or actually
really critical because they are doing a

37
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:09,780
better job of servicing women owned
businesses.

38
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,450
Um,
and so the thing that I always tell

39
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:15,960
founders is that vc might be for you,
it might not be,

40
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,780
but let's not romanticize what it is and
how it works.

41
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,040
Please do not take venture capital from
any investor no matter what terms are

42
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,350
giving you,
unless you're willing to be fired from

43
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:27,360
your own company,
which was what happens to a lot of

44
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:29,040
people who end up taking venture
capital.

45
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,880
The bottom line for me is that there are
many different sources of capital.

46
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,440
They are,
it's not a one size fits all regime and

47
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:40,970
we get fed one single product and the
reality is,

48
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:44,520
is a smart founder has to look around to
see what their other options are.

49
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,990
And I would say that this is not just a
nice to have this as a critical,

50
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:51,420
critical thing.
And part of the reason that I worry

51
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,790
about that,
there's a hack in my book,

52
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,790
um,
that comes from an amazing investor

53
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,460
called dawn Rayvon.
And he talks in the book about how he

54
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:03,760
knows how this movie's going to end,
which is this idea that we don't have

55
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:05,770
enough women and people of color getting
that,

56
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,070
for example.
And what I'm worried about and what he's

57
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:12,970
worried about is that in 10 years we're
going to look back at the statistics and

58
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:17,440
we're going to see that we had too many
women and people of color excepting

59
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:21,760
blindly horrible terms and horrible
venture capital packages.

60
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,790
And in 10 years when we look back,
what's that going to produce?

61
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,420
It's going to produce a whole series and
maybe even a whole generation of

62
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:31,390
entrepreneurs that were just
proportionately more likely to fail.

63
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,730
And I worry that in 10 years when we
look back at a statistic like that,

64
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,820
people aren't going to blame an
unbalanced capital stock.

65
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,180
They're not going to blame the fact that
people should have taken debt and they

66
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,190
didn't.
They're going to look at stats that

67
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:49,750
simply say that women and people of
color fail at a greater rate than anyone

68
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,630
else,
and I want that not to be the end of our

69
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:55,180
movie.
Some of my favorite alternatives in

70
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:59,410
terms of getting funding are things like
loans are things like lines of credits,

71
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,960
uh,
but there are some that are even less

72
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:04,330
impactful to your business.
There are a little more work,

73
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,290
but the country is now speckled all over
the country.

74
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,250
I can't think of a state that doesn't
have competitions that doesn't have

75
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,510
pitch events where you can go spend a
little bit of time and energy and get

76
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:19,660
money for your company,
especially in those early days because

77
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:23,950
you tell a good story because you have a
great idea and especially money that

78
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:27,340
doesn't actually have to require that
you give away equity in your company.

79
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,740
Another one of my favorite sources of
funding is a crowdfunding and there are

80
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:34,090
a couple different kinds,
right?

81
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:36,550
There's crowdfunding where you give
people t shirts,

82
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:39,790
are you pre sell whatever product you're
trying to manufacturer.

83
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,890
In that case,
you're not giving up any equity.

84
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:44,320
You're giving people goodwill,
you're giving people product,

85
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:46,810
you're giving people a sneak preview
into what you're working on.

86
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,360
And in exchange,
you're getting meaningful capital.

87
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,260
Women tend to be disproportionately more
successful at crowdfunding campaigns.

88
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,320
Um,
there are different studies that say why

89
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,230
that might be.
And I suspect that it's because their

90
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,540
social networks are strong.
And I also suspect it's because we're

91
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:05,740
shut out of other forms of capital,
but there's also equity crowd funding,

92
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,380
or you are actually giving a piece of
your company away,

93
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,420
much like you're doing with venture
capital.

94
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,050
But in the equity crowdfunding space,
the terms tend to be better,

95
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,590
so you're not giving away as much and
you're not giving away nearly as much

96
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:18,424
control.

97
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:25,150
Okay.
