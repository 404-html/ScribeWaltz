1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,490
Well,
the president should lead,

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,930
you know,
you can have individual states and

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,740
individual movements,
uh,

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,140
deciding,
uh,

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,230
issues affecting the country.
A president has to set it,

6
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:21,350
Tom,
and now when it comes to abortion,

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,500
I believe that in a woman's right to
choose.

8
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:26,990
But as president,
I would do everything I can to stop

9
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:31,790
unwanted pregnancies to,
to push for a adoption and sex education

10
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,550
and family planning.
Uh,

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,810
but at the same time,
uh,

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,620
when it comes to gay rights,
I think we should be a country that

13
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:42,830
honors the fact that we shouldn't
discriminate on the basis of race,

14
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:46,000
gender,
sexual orientation as a Gobbler,

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,790
uh,
in our red state,

16
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,950
as I say,
which a conservative state I had fought.

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,380
I have fought against those that want to
discriminate against the gays.

18
00:00:54,381 --> 00:00:59,381
And I have got the most gay pro gay
lesbian record in the country.

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,780
Not because it's politically popular.
Actually,

20
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,170
it's a very conservative state.
But because it's the right thing to do,

21
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,020
I would try to lead in those areas as
president.

22
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:13,340
Not imposed my will but,
but take strong moral stands.

23
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:15,650
Those are value stands.
You know,

24
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,710
we should be a nation of values and
values are not just a religious values.

25
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,280
Other values that we should emphasize is
the right to have healthcare,

26
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,440
the right for a child to be able to go
to school,

27
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,200
the right for anybody to pursue the
American dream.

28
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,170
So I would expand the definition of what
constitutes value.
