1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,150
Peaceful rise,
that is to say China's goal is to work

2
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:14,170
out the enormous internal contradictions
of the country,

3
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:17,290
the growth,
tremendous growth of wealth in urban

4
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,870
areas,
tremendous impoverishment and immobility

5
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:23,560
and rural areas and the fear of the
political explosion that could cause

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,630
China's goal was to work that stuff out
in a quiet setting as possible.

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,170
They don't want to cause international
upset.

8
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,530
They don't want to get into public
fights with the United States or anybody

9
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:37,600
else for that matter.
Nevertheless,

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,560
their political values are profoundly
different from ours.

11
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,710
I don't think we can have much
expectation of China changing China's

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,190
internal political culture.
What I think is a really complicated

13
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:50,590
challenge though,
is that China,

14
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:54,220
much more than Russia,
has a kind of exportable model.

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,380
That is to say they too have something
to promote,

16
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,760
but it's not democracy.
It's it's capitalist,

17
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,770
it's autocratic capitalism.
Russia doesn't feel that way because it

18
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,100
doesn't seem to have a system.

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,030
Where they have is a lot of oil which
just keeps their coffers refilled.

20
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,680
China has no such an inherent advantage.
China has figured out a means of

21
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:15,580
economic and social and political
organization whereby they can be an

22
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:19,960
incredible economic dynamo,
but keep a lid on politically.

23
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,060
Now,
this is of course a tremendously

24
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,660
appealing model.
If you're an autocrat in some

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,230
impoverished third world country and
China goes around the world,

26
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:33,070
especially to resource rich countries
and and offers to kind of deal,

27
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,110
you allow us to have a lock on your oil,
a certain amount of your oil,

28
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:41,080
so we have a guaranteed amount at a
guaranteed price.

29
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,640
We in turn will give you concessional
loans and grants.

30
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,820
You in turn will use those funds,
turn around and pay Chinese construction

31
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:54,460
and engineering companies to build your
infrastructure.

32
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,180
It's a great deal from the point of view
of the recipient countries.

33
00:01:58,181 --> 00:02:03,181
The only problem is that it cements in
place these authoritarian political

34
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:07,330
structures,
and so that's a problem for the west,

35
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:10,570
not just for the United States,
for other donors,

36
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,850
for institutions like the World Bank and
the IMF.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,950
How do we come up with a sufficiently
appealing,

38
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,010
countable,
and that's an ongoing problem.
