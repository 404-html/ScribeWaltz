1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,340
If we don't heed the lessons of the
1970s,

2
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:18,430
which were bad lessons and the lessons
be early part of this decade,

3
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,020
um,
then,

4
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,630
uh,
we will find ourselves in trouble.

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,570
Um,
and that is no matter what happens

6
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:30,571
during a period like this,
it is critical to preserve the quality

7
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:34,600
of life.
The schools have to continue to improve.

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,160
Crime cannot go up,
and ideally it has to go down.

9
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,670
The parks have to remain clean and well
maintained.

10
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:46,390
Our cultural institutions need to be
supported.

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,750
Housing stock has to be maintained and
people have to be able to afford to live

12
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,690
here where you maintain the quality of
life.

13
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:58,060
Yes,
we will all suffer somewhat during a

14
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:01,300
period of like this.
I think the mayor is the single best

15
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:06,301
person in the world to manage through a
crisis like this because he's very good

16
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:12,661
at finding ways of doing more with less
and understands fundamentally that what

17
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:18,151
this all is about is maintaining and
enhancing that quality of life so that

18
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,710
when the recovery does occur,
we haven't set ourselves back so far.

19
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,950
They will spend decades trying to dig
ourselves out of the hole.
