1
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,550
Look at the stars,
top 10% performers versus people who are

2
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:16,200
just mediocre.
Just at the average.

3
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,720
Uh,
there's a way to do a systematic

4
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:23,721
analysis of the capabilities or
competencies that stars have that you

5
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:26,150
don't find that the average David
Mcclellan,

6
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,200
it was one of the developers of this.
Really,

7
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:32,010
my work in emotional intelligence looks
at that because it turns out,

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,190
particularly for leadership,
most of the competencies that

9
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:38,490
distinguish outstanding leaders have
nothing to do with Iq,

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,580
with academic intelligence.
They're in this other domain,

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,630
uh,
whether people are getting more

12
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:48,750
competitive or not a more viciously
competitive,

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,020
I think people have always been
viciously competitive.

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,410
However,
people who are the most effective,

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,960
uh,
tend to be competitive in a different

16
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:00,090
way.
They compete with themselves.

17
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:01,140
They have,
as I said,

18
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:04,800
they have very high standards for
performance and they're continually

19
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:07,830
trying to understand how to learn to do
better.

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,050
And that's the more effective way to
compete,

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,280
improve your own performance,
not run against the other guy

22
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:15,114
necessarily.

23
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,850
Here's the problem with Malcolm's book.
You know,

24
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,850
he talks about cohorts that have been
privileged by accident,

25
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,300
by experience,
but one of them,

26
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:32,630
for example,
is a,

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,290
as I remember,
Jewish lawyers who were born in the

28
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:38,830
1930s and some of them were
spectacularly successful.

29
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,570
The problem is he didn't take a sample
of all Jewish lawyers born in thirties

30
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,670
there are also certain to be failures
among them,

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,240
and his model doesn't really explain
what distinguishes the failures from the

32
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,570
outliers,
which,

33
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,490
so it's a good beginning,
but you know,

34
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:57,430
I was waiting for the other shoe to drop
and then the book ended.

35
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,520
But Malcolm is a wonderful writer.
I really don't know.
