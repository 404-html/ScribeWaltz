1
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,130
Well,
I mean,

2
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:12,131
I guess the hard lines,
secularism is not a good idea.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,150
Uh,
which is not to say that secularism is

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,150
not a good idea.
I mean,

5
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:17,770
I,
I've,

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,770
I certainly think that the attempt in
the United States to buy groups here to

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,690
rewrite American history as a sort of
Christian story and to portray the

8
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:31,370
founding fathers as,
as,

9
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:34,370
um,
Christian fathers is something that

10
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:37,730
really needs to be challenged.
And,

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,900
and in the name of,
of secular in the name of history,

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,660
but accurate history as well as
everything else.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,580
But I think the kind of hard,
no secularism of France that kind of,

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,240
um,
unbending insistence on,

15
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,860
um,
that secular means one thing and that

16
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,550
violations of it are,
will not be tolerated in any way is a

17
00:01:04,011 --> 00:01:04,910
bad idea.
Um,

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,010
and that if you're accommodating,
um,

19
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,680
different groups,
different populations,

20
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,980
um,
what you need to do is figure out ways

21
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:13,860
of accommodating them.

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,020
The way the French did when they passed
the 1905 loss separating church and

23
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:19,910
state the way they did with the Catholic
church.

24
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,970
There was a day off for religious
instruction for kids.

25
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,290
All the holidays in France still,
or some are state holidays,

26
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,840
but most of them are Catholic,
not even just Christian Catholic

27
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:31,550
holidays.
Um,

28
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,030
parts of France are Alsace.
And Lorraine Alsace Moselle those

29
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:39,530
departments which were,
um,

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,800
under German control when the 1905 law
was passed and then came back to France

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,100
after the war.
Those con,

32
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,160
those areas were never forced to adopt
the secular practices that the rest of

33
00:01:56,691 --> 00:01:57,930
the country,
uh,

34
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,080
adopted.
So still in those areas,

35
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:02,080
you can have religious teaching in
schools,

36
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,880
children have to take a course in
religious instruction and so on and so

37
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:07,790
forth.
So if they're not even consistent,

38
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,050
it's not even a nationally consistent
policy in relation to Catholicism,

39
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,680
which was the dominant religion at the
time the law was passed.

40
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,370
So to act as if it's either secularism
or nothing,

41
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,250
or that the secular and the religious
are in eternal opposition to each other

42
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:33,251
is to misrepresent French history and to
create a situation in which they will

43
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:38,010
only be a greater sense of,
um,

44
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,290
felt discrimination and,
um,

45
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,050
anger on the part of the population's
whom these these laws affect.

46
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,820
Uh,
so,

47
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,070
uh,
it seems to me that that kind of hard

48
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,110
lines,
secularism,

49
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:56,111
which is as fundamentalist in its way as
the most extreme Islam Islamist

50
00:02:56,871 --> 00:03:01,840
fundamentalism is defeats its own
purpose and really doesn't,

51
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,290
um,
ended up producing a situation in which

52
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,510
there can be a certain kind of
pluralism,

53
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,440
cultural pluralism and political
assimilation and political citizenship.
