1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,800
No,
some people try to draw a line and say,

2
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:12,310
well,
some animals are this and other animals,

3
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:14,230
so not,
and there are differences across

4
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:16,390
species,
but all species,

5
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:20,740
all individuals within a species deserve
to be treated with respect and

6
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:23,110
compassion.
As individuals.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,090
I see everything on a continuum.
I see psychological continuity between

8
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:32,890
humans and the other animals and across
a dolphins and primates,

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,970
and that simply reflects the fact that
evolution works by building upon

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,820
existing structures and processes.
So that's reflected in the fact that we

11
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:50,311
all share a common psychology and each
species each.

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,040
If you're an individual,
no matter whether you're a dolphin or a

13
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:59,041
monkey or a person or an Aardvark,
you have that basic psychology that's

14
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:04,330
just changed a little bit depending upon
what species you are.
