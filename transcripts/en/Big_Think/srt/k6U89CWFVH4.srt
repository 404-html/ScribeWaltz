1
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,310
Well,
certainly not having any choice,

2
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,120
having your entire life dictated by
others.

3
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:19,920
You know,
like none of us would choose.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,050
No matter where we are in the world,
would choose to,

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,590
you know,
become a member of Orwell's 1984 world.

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,650
But how much choice is really the
question when we know that some choice

7
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,470
makes you better off than no choice.
Now do we get better off if we go from a

8
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:45,060
lot of choice versus a few choices?
And there I think the answer is much,

9
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:46,770
much,
much more complicated.

10
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,710
If you truly have expertise and
expertise can be,

11
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:58,020
say a chess master who's really mastered
something,

12
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,920
or I'm an artist or a musician of some
sort,

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,730
you know,
if you give a jazz musician I once the

14
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:08,250
jazz musician learns all the
fundamentals,

15
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:10,890
they can keep track of a lot of choices
in an instant.

16
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,950
A chess master can keep track of more
choices than the number of stars in the

17
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:17,820
galaxy within an instant.

18
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,260
But these are people that have truly
learned and mastered the choices that

19
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,820
they have and how to deal with those
choices are a very,

20
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:30,480
very long period of training.
So essentially what they're really doing

21
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:35,481
is ruling out all the irrelevant choices
and only zeroing in on the most

22
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,510
relevant,
useful choices at the moment.

23
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,710
So most of the time when we are
confronted by more,

24
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:46,490
rather than a few choices,
we're often novices.

25
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,430
And so we don't really know how to
differentiate these various options.

26
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,600
We also don't always know what we want.
And in those cases,

27
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,960
it can actually make us worse off
because it's actually easier to figure

28
00:01:57,961 --> 00:02:02,130
out what you want and to figure out how
options differ.

29
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,460
If you have about a handful of them,
then if you have a hundred of them.
