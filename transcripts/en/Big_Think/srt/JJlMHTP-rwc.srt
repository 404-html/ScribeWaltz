1
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,320
I never really wanted to be a scientist,
but I got very interested in physics

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,010
when I was about 15.
Uh,

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,670
I had quit school when I was 13 and,
uh,

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,040
I just somehow got interested in physics
and uh,

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,230
and then I just thought I'd studied for
awhile until I could do something else.

6
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,640
And uh,
just things happened in such a way that,

7
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:36,020
that never happened.
Well,

8
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:39,990
you know,
I wanted to be an editor for fiction or

9
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:40,824
a filmmaker,

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,273
uh,

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,990
or a great writer or a jazz musician
that wasn't really smart enough to be

12
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,990
any of those things.
Unfortunately.

13
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,773
Uh,

14
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,790
you know,
the thing about particle physics is

15
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:02,241
that,
uh,

16
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:05,990
it's very intellectually alluring and
then you're,

17
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,200
you get to do a lot of really fun things
in it.

18
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:13,310
Like you get to build huge experiments
and you actually do it yourself.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,200
So you get to drive forklifts and you
get to work with flammable gases and

20
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:21,960
explosive things and you get to drill
things and,

21
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,200
and at the same time,
you get to think about,

22
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,570
um,
you know,

23
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,970
quantum mechanics and philosophical
things.

24
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:33,500
And you get to do write computer code.
You have to do a lot of things that are

25
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:36,170
very,
very fun and you don't normally get to

26
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:38,930
do them in life.
Usually you just like move into an

27
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:42,120
apartment.
It's already made and then you just cook

28
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:42,591
dinner.
I mean,

29
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:44,970
that's it.
In this case started.

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,880
You get to build the whole thing and uh,
you know,

31
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,020
wire it and do everything does that.
And that may not make any sense,

32
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:53,780
but you really get to do a lot of fun
things.

33
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:57,650
And I guess that sort of kept me,
kept me in it.
