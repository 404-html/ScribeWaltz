1
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,770
I think there's two things that I've
really seen in my perspective,

2
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:14,030
the Internet changing,
one is who's using it and to how it's

3
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:15,860
being used.
You know,

4
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:19,580
I went to school at Uc Santa Cruz right
when the Internet was really being

5
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:21,920
developed and I can remember doing my,
you know,

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,060
my coding,
you know,

7
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:25,740
my das coding and I was on computers
land.

8
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:28,330
It was a very impersonal,
um,

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,620
medium.
Um,

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,230
and then websites came where you went to
the website and you got information and

11
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:35,870
maybe you did ecommerce.
But what's really changed about the

12
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:38,480
Internet now it's become much more of an
intimate of tool.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,480
It's about for many people it's about
their life.

14
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:44,180
It's about we go on Amazon,
it's about the books that they might

15
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:44,661
like,
you know,

16
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:47,590
what's recommended.
They're reading the reviews that they're

17
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,750
their friends or even strangers instead
of just advertisement.

18
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:53,180
So the whole Internet has become,
with facebook,

19
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:56,210
with my space is become much more of an
intimate and personal thing.

20
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,050
And because of that,
I think that the dynamics and who is

21
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:02,930
using it have really changed.
I think it started off as sort of a

22
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:06,860
white male,
sort of a geeky tool and now actually

23
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:10,330
more women are online.
The men are more women are blogging than

24
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:13,430
men are women.
It's really a women's a medium.

25
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:15,830
If you think about it.
I mean we are through our brain

26
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:18,200
chemistry.
We're wired to be connected to other

27
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:21,910
people and the Internet is such a
powerful way to connect whether it's

28
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:22,970
through,
you know,

29
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,390
my space or I'm a facebook or twitter,
you know,

30
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,690
I think a lot of these things are going
to come and go.

31
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:31,250
I think twitter will come and then you
know,

32
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,170
who knows?
There might be a new version of twitter

33
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:36,020
that technology may change,
but the truth is is that people are

34
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:38,910
gaining relationships in new ways than
they ever have been.

35
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:43,490
Like I can talk to someone in Ghana
about a problem with genital mutilation

36
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:46,700
that I never was before.
So it's become much more of an intimate

37
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:48,620
tool.
It's changed politics.

38
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,410
What's interesting now with Intel,
Andy Grove is always poking holes in his

39
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:00,000
company to try to find out,
you know,

40
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,890
whereas competitors are going to come in
and take them out all at one time was

41
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:09,090
the breakthrough technology and then all
of a sudden aol is sort of an old story

42
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:11,610
in the new stories,
facebook and sort of what will be next

43
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,350
after that.
There's so much.

44
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,190
The convergence between the web and
television is completely is what's next.

45
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,300
You know,
every,

46
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,430
almost every household has a television.
It's part of our lives.

47
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:27,930
It's part of our identity and that
intimacy that we see both through the

48
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:29,940
Internet and also what people are
enjoying watching.

49
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,030
People love American idol because it's
an intimate show.

50
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,400
They're seeing people like themselves
reflecting.

51
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,680
So I'm not sure exactly where it's
going,

52
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:40,740
but I know we're going to continue to
have user generated content.

53
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,920
I think people are going to be booking,
they're creating their own television

54
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:44,920
shows.
Um,

55
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,240
I think that,
uh,

56
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,270
um,
there's going to be much more instant

57
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:51,990
response to the way that television
works and we're just going to see a

58
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:52,770
convergence.
