1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,580
There's two different sorts of frauds as
I understand it,

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,930
to a fraud or corruption of just a lump 
them together.

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,540
But you've got,
you've got theft corruption in it.

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,010
Just to give you,
you know,

5
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:20,080
could have a,
um,

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,570
an example.
And again,

7
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:23,600
I'm not,
I'm,

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,493
I'm not looking to be insulting to,
to the various developing world 

9
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:28,294
governments and to say that they're all 
fraudulent and everybody there was 

10
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:31,844
fraudulent.
They're clearly not in some very honest 

11
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:35,110
and a lot of very,
very good people over there.

12
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:37,240
But some of the challenges become that,
you know,

13
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:40,600
when the minister of finance transfers 
the money to the Ministry of Education,

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,673
you know,
there are occasions where some of the 

15
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:43,444
money and it goes the administer of 
education convinced that check into 

16
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:47,914
cash,
that cash now's got to get distributed 

17
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:52,360
to the districts.
And then the districts,

18
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:56,410
I've got to then distribute the cash to 
the local parishes,

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,180
then the parishes.

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,013
I've got to distribute it to the school 
masters and to the principals in the 

21
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:01,264
school.
So you can imagine how there could be 

22
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:07,720
situations where some people along that 
chain of the cash take their time.

23
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:08,921
Um,
you know,

24
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:09,754
along the way and when the,
so by the time the people that the who 

25
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:15,100
are supposed to receive the,
the,

26
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,180
their salary that,
you know,

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,200
the hundred percent of the cash that was
a given upfront to the ministry,

28
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,920
there's only 80% left by the time it 
gets to the teacher at the bottom end.

29
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,903
Now,
these are the sorts of situations that 

30
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:32,830
have been described to me as being very 
typical.

31
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,530
It's not,
it doesn't,

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,460
it doesn't always happen in every single
place,

33
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:38,230
but clearly these are problems.
Um,

34
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,600
and then when the young woman wants to 
collect her,

35
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,733
collect her $80 leftover from the 
hundred that was originally supposed to 

36
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:45,514
get,
then the,

37
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,393
the person who was supposed to give it 
to her very often will abuse the woman 

38
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:52,030
until he actually gives her the money,
cause he's got the power over the money.

39
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,040
Um,
but in addition to that,

40
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,083
there are also many,
many ghost employees in the system 

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,380
because there are no very good checks 
and balances.

42
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:02,410
So that's one element of the corruption 
and the fraud,

43
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,100
which maps system we'll be able to 
provide a solution for.

44
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:06,934
So,
uh,

45
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,803
the governments are very keen to underst
because they'll save a lot of money 

46
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:11,620
because of the,
uh,

47
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:13,330
the people get paid,
you know,

48
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:15,040
kind of directly so that people will be 
happy.

49
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,990
They'll get paid the amount that they're
supposed to get paid.

50
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:19,990
So they'll suddenly start finding that 
they're saving a lot of money.

51
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,580
Um,
from there,

52
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,720
the time they send out their $1 million 
or whatever the number is from the top,

53
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,243
that they'll find that that million 
dollars when they actually sent it 

54
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:31,360
directly to the people,
a,

55
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,650
the people will get the money they're 
supposed to get for,

56
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:35,740
there'll be a lot of employees that 
didn't really exist.

57
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,550
So that's one level of corruption.
There's another level of corruption,

58
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:42,700
which is that you have to pay people to 
make things happen.

59
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,830
And I haven't thought it through well 
enough to see kind of Kemet solution,

60
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,200
uh,
come and help out in that situation.

61
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,260
I don't know if we can solve every 
situation,

62
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:54,094
but in terms of the corruption and the 
fraud and the lack of transparency and 

63
00:02:57,701 --> 00:03:01,270
the abuse of payments of,
you know,

64
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:04,630
government type payments to people.
And the pensions,

65
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,643
you know that not everybody gets all the
pension that they're supposed to get 

66
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:08,584
because of the cash distribution.
Those are the sorts of situations that 

67
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:17,341
map solution can provide a,
a a great benefit to develop.

68
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:22,660
We will government when people aren't 
identified,

69
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,973
they just don't exist.
And there's a lot of discussion before 

70
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:28,930
you ask me the next question.
What about the privacy rights?

71
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,011
You know,
kind of of the,

72
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:31,030
of the people,
if there's,

73
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,083
if,
if the governments are going to have so 

74
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,620
much information about the people 
because they have their biometrics,

75
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:38,440
they'll know that I have the health 
information and then they'll have some,

76
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:41,020
they'll have potentially access to some 
financial information.

77
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,273
Currently these people don't exist,
so the government has ultimate power 

78
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,484
over these people.
The more you enable individuals to 

79
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:52,270
become part of a formal society,
the more freedom they have,

80
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,313
the more economic success they have.
And everybody recognizes that economic 

81
00:03:57,401 --> 00:04:02,401
success creates an environment of 
stability and peace.

82
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,353
So it's very,
very much in the best interests of the 

83
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:12,550
countries themselves that you know that,
that they can have stability and peace.

84
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,693
It's in the interest of the developing 
world to be able to create an 

85
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:21,220
environment where people are happy.
People you know,

86
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:23,050
kind of ended up that the people exist.

87
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,600
And from a,
from a larger perspective,

88
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,273
today we're dealing in an environment 
where there's very limited money 

89
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,760
available for an Oda in overseas 
development assistance.

90
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,823
So the challenge for the governments is 
to find ways to maximize the efficiency 

91
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,360
of the money that is being used.
And I believe that by,

92
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,433
for the donor countries,
whether it's partnering through the 

93
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,130
World Bank or a USA ID or deferred or 
all these agencies,

94
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,293
their ability to identify private sector
companies that will have their own skin 

95
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:00,394
in the game.
And then I've got their own agenda to 

96
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:04,600
ensure some longterm sustainability of 
the projects,

97
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,733
that there's the ability for these 
companies to leverage the donor money 

98
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,880
and convert equity to growth and create 
an environment where there'll be,

99
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,043
um,
long term success is the way that 

100
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:23,950
governments need to be looking at.
Um,

101
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,813
they're developing.
