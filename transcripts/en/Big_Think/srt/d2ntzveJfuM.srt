1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,410
It was alleged that the newspapers were
not aware of the large percentage of the

2
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:14,511
population of American citizens were
unhappy with the ruling establishment,

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,400
did not feel their voices are being
heard,

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,800
and they voted against what everybody
thought was was the leading candidate

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,820
and instead voted for this rank
outsider,

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,490
a very unpredictable and generally
unpopular person.

7
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:37,660
Because businessman this egotist,
this rakish character named Donald

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,990
Trump.
I thought what was missing from the

9
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:46,560
newspapers,
and I think more than that from

10
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:49,440
Americans in general,
who watched television,

11
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,070
who read books to teach in universities
who are among the educated classes,

12
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,450
which go almost includes everybody these
days.

13
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,530
The reason I say that in my lifetime,
born in 1932 and becoming a journalist

14
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,680
in the 19 fifties and at the time I
became a journalist,

15
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,450
the 19 fifties we journalists,
whether it worked for the New York Times

16
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,520
and the Philadelphia Inquirer or the
Chicago Tribune,

17
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,240
where generally the first of our family
to have gone to college.

18
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,760
And when I say college,
I do not mean Harvard,

19
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:24,361
Yale,
Princeton,

20
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:27,630
Stanford.
I mean Brooklyn College or in my case,

21
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:31,020
the University of Alabama.
We were not going to the elite colleges.

22
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,380
If we went to college at all,
it was we were considered scholars in

23
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:37,080
our family,
but what we were,

24
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,520
what we were not true today,
but what we in the Mid Twentieth Century

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,530
America,
we were outsiders.

26
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,110
We journalists were of the outsider
class,

27
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:51,111
whether we were Italian heritage is me
or Jewish or African American or

28
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:53,340
Spanish,
whatever,

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,640
and we saw through the outside looking
in with our nose pressed against the

30
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:05,421
glass.
We looked inside at power and privilege

31
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,600
at maneuverings within the political
system,

32
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,430
at a poc,
cracy,

33
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,210
at outright deceit.
We saw all this and sometimes if we had

34
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:18,450
courage,
we wrote about and we did have courage

35
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,990
because most of us had come from parents
or grandparents who had knew,

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,760
who had firsthand knowledge,
persecution and foreign countries who

37
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,920
came to this country on the run and
brought with them the spirit of

38
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:42,480
unfairness and we as the inheritors of
their spirit when journalism.

39
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,420
We were the children of those period of
those people.

40
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,380
We brought not cynicism,
but skepticism of power and it was never

41
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,610
our ambition to be part of power because
we were chroniclers of power.

42
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:59,100
We were critics of power.
We were viewers of power.

43
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,480
We were outsiders.
Well,

44
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,250
those days are long,
long,

45
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:04,490
long gone.
Well,

46
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:08,410
we have now 50 years beyond what I'm
talking about,

47
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:14,490
the group of journalists who go to the
same elite schools as the most

48
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:20,191
privileged people have power.
Obama was a college professor,

49
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:25,030
Harvard Man,
and he was teaching while a president

50
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:30,031
for the two terms essentially teaching
class to the higher classes,

51
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,440
including the journalism of his time.
Now you have this ranking foul mouth

52
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,950
guy with his oldest awful blonde hair
becoming elected and the people in

53
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:47,860
general.
Oh God,

54
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,420
it's so embarrassing.
It's like they were so stunned is like

55
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:54,950
having a.

56
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,790
their.
Their world is shattered and have why

57
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,320
you're so shattered.
Why are you so stupid?

58
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,480
Don't you realize that you join you.
Journalists are so blind.

59
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,490
You don't know as journalist anything
except being educated from the time

60
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,890
you're.
You're privileged little kids.

61
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,420
I mean,
even poor people,

62
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,580
black people,
Hispanic,

63
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,530
still want to be like the privileged
white people and what I'm getting at,

64
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,830
and her long winded way is the way
journalists have failed,

65
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,330
were failed profession.
The pride that my generation took,

66
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,020
being strong as a force against the
powers of prerogative,

67
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,430
powers of privilege doesn't exist
anymore.

68
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,760
It doesn't exist anywhere.
The journalist now want to be part of

69
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:41,770
the power game.
They wanted to get on Air Force One.

70
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,820
They want to join trump at 21.
They want to have that dinner.

71
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,650
20 one with the.
They want to be clustered in Washington,

72
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:50,950
which is the most decadent city.

73
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,750
It's the most evil empire.
If I were running Washington,

74
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,410
boy do I sometimes have grandiose ideas
in the middle of the night,

75
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,400
if I was already what I would get half
of those reporters out of Washington,

76
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,090
break up the Washington press corps,
send them all over to the state

77
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:09,670
capitals.
We have 50 states,

78
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,060
put two reporters in every state instead
of covering congress or the cabinet or

79
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,890
whatever.
Let the people who are from these states

80
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,850
report the mood of the state's report.
The feelings,

81
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:28,390
the findings,
the personalities that are in parts of

82
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:33,391
America that are not and in the main
main street and main light,

83
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,800
and we tell our story not for the power
brokers that are clustered Washington,

84
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:40,990
those privilege power and generally rich
people,

85
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,890
but we're tell something about the
results of law,

86
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:47,110
the results of privilege,
the results of ignorance,

87
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:49,120
the results of,
of,

88
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,960
of bad decisions and war would cover.
Injured.

89
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:56,320
Soldiers would cover the life of,
of farmers,

90
00:05:56,321 --> 00:06:00,620
would cover a grease mechanic and a guy
that's some redneck sheriff somewhere.

91
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,280
And if we knew the America that way,
we would not be surprised by such an

92
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:11,420
election as we had and the aftermath of
Obama's eight years.
