1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,300
The Arctic,
a wash for centuries,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,150
uh,
largely unknown,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,520
very remote part of the Western world.
And it was only 100 years ago that to

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,370
discover is starting to go to the North
Pole and to these remote areas and then

5
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:27,651
the cold war or close to the Arctic in
terms of military confrontation and the

6
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:31,680
conflict between the Soviet Union on one
hand,

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,430
the western powers on the other.
Joe,

8
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:39,990
one of the most important things to
remember when we look at the Arctic and

9
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:44,991
the beginning of the 21st century is
that it is show recently that we as

10
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:53,211
mankind have been able to come together
to discuss on the site what do we do

11
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,980
with respect to the Arctic future.
There is no part of planet us,

12
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,130
which are so recently arrived on our
desk as a challenge and as an

13
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:13,770
opportunity.
So therefore the corporation in the

14
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:18,690
Arctic is one of the most crucial issues
of the 21st century.

15
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,920
For many reasons.
One age that uh,

16
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,800
this is the front line,
no climate change.

17
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,860
The aggression melting of the ice in the
Arctic will have consequences all over

18
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,950
the world.
They've only our quarter of the

19
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,980
greenland ice sheet melts.
This will lead to two meters rising sea

20
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:46,011
levels everywhere in the world.
And already we are seeing that the

21
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:52,211
present melting of the Arctic Sea ice is
causing extreme weather events in the

22
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:56,700
United States,
in Asia,

23
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,850
I than other parts of the world.
In audition,

24
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,590
the Arctic is one of the richest parts
of the world in terms of untapped

25
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,620
natural resources.
And with the continuous melting of the

26
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,490
Arctic Sea ice,
uh,

27
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:16,491
there will be a new shipping lines
linking Asia to America and Europe in a

28
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:22,320
revolutionary way,
like the Suez Canal on the Panama Canal.

29
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,840
That in his time a lot of this,
why the Arctic has now become the new

30
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,740
economic and political playing field.

31
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,460
In 2015 the United States takes on the
chairmanship of the Arctic Council.

32
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,740
It is the first time we change the
Arctic Council became a treaty making

33
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:47,010
organization,
but the US takes on that responsibility

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,200
and the chairmanship is not the US,
uh,

35
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,360
a formal role.
Uh,

36
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,040
it's just supposed to provide a vision,
uh,

37
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:02,041
a policy agenda and a direction towards
the future joints.

38
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,800
And very important that all the people
in the United States or introduced it in

39
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:10,810
climate change or interested in the
environment,

40
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,550
realize that in the next two or three
years,

41
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,330
the US will be in the leadership role
with respect to the future of the

42
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:24,700
Arctic,
of course,

43
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:28,690
in partnership with other Arctic
countries as well as the option of the

44
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,700
states from Asia and Europe.
Although the Arctic council liaison

45
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,500
intergovernmental body,
there is a role for activists and

46
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:41,020
environmentalist,
a expert scientist,

47
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:46,000
ordinary people in this process.
And in order to facilitate that together

48
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:47,950
with many other partners from the
Arctic,

49
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:50,860
I established last year what's called
the Arctic Circle,

50
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,400
which is a kind of a on the
international assembly where everybody,

51
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,660
whether it's a,
an individual or citizen or,

52
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,030
or government or corporation or a
scientific institute or university or

53
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:11,380
activist group can come together where
everybody has the same role,

54
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,710
the same rights to speak on and discuss.

55
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,120
So I would encourage,
especially the next two or three years,

56
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,890
everybody who is concerned about these
issues in the United States.

57
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,790
First of all,
to look at the Arctic circle on the

58
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,370
website,
Arctic circle.org and see if you want to

59
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:34,060
come to the assembly or if you want to
attend the forum meetings that will take

60
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:39,061
place in the United States in Greenland
and Singapore as well as Iceland in the

61
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:42,160
next 12 to 18 months.
But I'll,

62
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:46,720
we'll all be aware that your own
country,

63
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,900
the United States of America,
well from 2015 2017 be the leader in

64
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:02,641
making policy and agreement and map out
the future for that part of planet does,

65
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,860
where climate change is most
aggressively taking place.

66
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,280
There was a big great march in New York
about the climate at hundreds and

67
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,250
thousands of people participated.
I'm not sure if many of them realized

68
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,520
that in the early months of next year it
will be the u s who will chair the

69
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:33,991
international cooperation on that part
of mother Earth where climate change is

70
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:37,060
most aggressively taking place.
