1
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,420
I would like the American political
process to change.

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:15,430
I don't know how or when or just don't
know how that would happen or how it's

3
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:20,160
going to happen.
I feel like we have this two party

4
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:25,020
system that is serving the two party
system and companies,

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,690
big companies in America and to the
detriment of,

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,550
of the,
the supposedly populous of America that

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,970
is supposedly the,
you know,

8
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,670
who the government is supposed to be
serving.

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,160
And I also think they environment is a,
is a big issue.

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,140
Um,
I was just reading about green

11
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:45,200
accounting this morning,
um,

12
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,910
which is basically trying to work,
um,

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,260
the environment into the balance sheet
on a,

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,340
on a corporate level so that I'm
a so that if you,

15
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,370
you know,
the,

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,450
the example was if you chopped down a
redwood tree to make a picnic table,

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,970
like for the picnic table maker that
has,

18
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:03,690
uh,
you know,

19
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,310
it has an effect on their bottom line is
that has an effect on the US GDP.

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,700
But what effect does that have on people
who would normally use that redwood in

21
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:16,220
its natural sort of environment?
You know,

22
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,710
we have all this wealth that's,
that's essentially being created from

23
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:22,410
nature,
I mean from the energy of the sun,

24
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,210
from,
um,

25
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,000
both pretty much from the energy of the
sun and the energy,

26
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,120
the earth and through people sweat and
things like that.

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,030
And you have all these companies making
all this money,

28
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,150
you know,
from nature.

29
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:40,080
But I think the balance sheet is kind of
uneven in that regard.

30
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:42,180
We're not,
I don't think we're giving enough back

31
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,410
and at some point we're gonna find
ourselves in,

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,550
in trouble as far as not having enough
planet to live on.

33
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:50,880
Perhaps.
