1
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,610
One of the great things about the liver 
is that it regenerates,

2
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:17,380
so if you cut out somebody half of 
someone's liver,

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,363
it grows back.
That's why we can now not only use 

4
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,550
cadaver livers,
but we can use,

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,360
we can use portions of living donors.
Um,

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,570
it's entirely possible that,
that,

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,510
um,
and there's work being done in this area

8
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:32,344
that in the future,
a liver transplant will be no more than 

9
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:36,574
an injection of a number of cells that 
will implant somewhere in the body and 

10
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,124
will grow and form an entire new liver.
So this is the whole area of stem cell 

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,600
transplantation.
Um,

12
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,230
and then I think the last area,
um,

13
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,060
and this is a fairly controversial area,
but I think has great potential,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,801
um,
and,

15
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:59,530
and the background here is that as you 
may be aware,

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,800
there are many people,
particularly with liver disease,

17
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,580
many more people that need livers than 
we currently have livers for.

18
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,463
Um,
there's a whole area called 

19
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:14,851
xenotransplantation in which the idea is
that we would take animals,

20
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,903
pigs big,
currently the preferred animal and be 

21
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:23,494
able to modify them genetically in such 
a way that a human would not only not 

22
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:29,944
reject a pig liver,
but that any potential diseases that 

23
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,460
would be unique to a animals would not 
be able to be contracted by a human.

24
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,020
This is a big,
a big concern right now that,

25
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,560
that you could envision 20 years from 
now,

26
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,760
everyone who needs a liver having access
to one because you would walk into,

27
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,360
um,
and I'm just as,

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,170
I'm just imagine you walk into a 
facility,

29
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:59,290
you take out a pig and you'll use the 
pig liver for the,

30
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,840
for the patient or the pig pen.
So I think,

31
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:02,950
I think,
um,

32
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,730
I think technical advances in the,
in the,

33
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,593
uh,
leading to minimally increasingly 

34
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:12,870
minimally invasive surgery,
um,

35
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,013
a new drugs and ultimately a sufficient 
understanding of the immune system that 

36
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:22,880
no drugs would be necessary.
Um,

37
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,333
um,
the use of cells rather than whole 

38
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:31,640
organs.
And potentially the use of animal organs

39
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,483
are probably the four areas of the 
future with when it comes to to solid 

40
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:38,794
organ trail.
