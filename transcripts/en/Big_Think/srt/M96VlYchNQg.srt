1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,000
Never read on your friends and always
keep your mouth shut.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,250
If you elevate loyalty over trip,
you've got a situation like barry bonds,

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,930
personal trainer,
Greg Anderson.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,750
He was initially questioned about
whether he gave steroids,

5
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:17,440
are injected barry bonds with steroids.
He law and he said he never did.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,410
Then when called before the grand jury,
he refused to testify.

7
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:23,710
He was held in contempt of court.
He was put in jail on multiple occasions

8
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:26,770
for remaining silent and one,
one of those occasions when he was

9
00:00:26,771 --> 00:00:29,260
released from jail,
all the inmates gathered around and gave

10
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:31,330
him a standing ovation.
Well,

11
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:35,920
this to me pretty much says it all.
Loyalty over truth means this is the

12
00:00:35,921 --> 00:00:39,190
code of the prison yard.
This is the code of organized crime.

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,840
This is the code of the Mafia.

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,613
Yes,

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,050
they weren't going to prosecute use of
steroids,

16
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:49,210
but they wanted to nail this guy for
distributing it.

17
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,670
So Barry bonds was called before the
grand jury.

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,610
He had been given immunity.
The only thing he could be prosecuted

19
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:58,060
for perjury or false statements,
he took the oath.

20
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,610
They then ask him,
did you use steroids?

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,950
No.
Were you ever injected with steroids?

22
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,770
No.
He lied repeatedly to the grand jury.

23
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:11,310
Why did it take eight years from the
time that barry bonds allegedly lodge to

24
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:14,860
the grand jury until he was actually
tried for the case?

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,410
It was because everyone was long.
In that case,

26
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,320
it was worldclass lying on a massive
scale,

27
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,620
and all the prosecutors could do was
investigate people for perjury where

28
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,660
they couldn't get to the underlying
crimes.

29
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,990
Loyalty,
loyalty to one's employer.

30
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:32,970
Loyalty to a benefactor is a very
powerful countervailing force.

31
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:38,110
There must be some kind of punishment
and accountability in an ancient Rome.

32
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:40,510
People were put to death in medieval
England.

33
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,050
They had their tongues cut out.
I'm not saying we need to go to,

34
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:45,700
is that barbaric?
Extreme,

35
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,150
but there must be visible accountability
for breaking the law.

36
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:51,510
Yeah.
