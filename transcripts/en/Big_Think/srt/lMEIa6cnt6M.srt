1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,153
Hmm.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,930
The first started working on this book I
wrote to do lists the same way that most

3
00:00:07,931 --> 00:00:11,530
people write to do lists and it turns
out this is exactly the wrong way to

4
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:14,350
write it to do list according to
psychologist and neurologist.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,310
I would sit down in the morning and I
would just jot down all the tasks I

6
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:22,630
wanted to do that day and I would put on
a couple of things at the top of my page

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,800
that were like pretty easy to do cause
it cause I,

8
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:29,380
it felt so good to cross those off like
early in the day and feel a sense of

9
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:32,350
accomplishment and I'd put my big tasks
at the bottom of the page.

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,680
Sometimes at the top of the page I would
even write things that I had already

11
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:39,490
done because it just made me so happy to
like sit at my desk and be able to cross

12
00:00:39,491 --> 00:00:40,570
something off right away.

13
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,690
Psychologists call this using a to do
list for mood repair rather than for

14
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:48,850
productivity.
And it turns out this is exactly the

15
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:52,090
wrong way to write a,
to do list the right way to write a,

16
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:55,060
to do list.
The way that genuinely productive people

17
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:59,440
and companies write to do lists is it
that at the top of the page,

18
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,080
they write their big ambition,
their stretch goal.

19
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,160
They write something that seems almost
impossible to achieve because that

20
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:10,780
reminds you all day long what you
actually want to get done.

21
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,920
And then underneath they write out a
plan,

22
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,070
they write a smart goal,
they break that big ambition into small

23
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:21,790
components.
Now that gives me a way to start in the

24
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,340
morning,
but what's important is that when I get

25
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:26,500
something accomplished,
when I'm able to cross something off my

26
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:29,770
to do list,
I don't experience that sense of relief

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,160
that allows me to,
uh,

28
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,230
go spend half an hour or 90 minutes like
on facebook,

29
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:36,670
right?
I don't feel like I,

30
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,330
I can take a break and I can go waste
time wandering around.

31
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,680
I'm ready to start on the next task
because of the top of my page.

32
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,490
I'm constantly being reminded that
although I'm making incremental

33
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:51,490
progress,
this is in service to a bigger goal.

34
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,180
There's something bigger and more
meaningful that I want to accomplish

35
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,850
this day.
And as long as I'm being reminded of

36
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,490
that,
but I still have a plan study after

37
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:04,480
study shows,
I'm much more likely to get more things

38
00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:07,600
done and to focus on the right things
each day.

39
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,990
Mm.
