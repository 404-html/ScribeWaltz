1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,390
The thing we should do with people who
create art that have done terrible

2
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:14,391
things as well.
If you found out as I head of Johnson

3
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:20,691
and Johnson was a serial rapist that
everybody at Johnson and Johnson knew

4
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,620
one way or another,
would you still buy that baby powder?

5
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,580
Sorry.
Your heroes are going away.

6
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,470
Why aren't there more important things
to do?

7
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:34,191
Okay.
Sorry.

8
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:35,000
Bummer.
For you.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,660
Within the construct of society,
the raping and killing of women,

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,460
there's a channel called Id.
It's devoted to 24 hours a day of

11
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:46,190
sexualizing murder victims.
Okay.

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,280
Stop it.
Stop it.

13
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:50,600
Stop it.
Stop it.

14
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,440
That's my message is knock it off when
you don't get to like woody Allen.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,490
Oh,
what a big,

16
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:58,190
huge loss for you.
I'm sure that compares to the girl who's

17
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,260
just been raped.
That now feels like she wants to hang

18
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:01,670
herself from her balcony.
Right?

19
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,270
Cause that really balances out.
So when people bitch about that.

20
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,920
Sorry,
bomber for you,

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,900
you don't watch birth of a nation to
you?

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,130
Probably not because you know it's
racist.

23
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,490
So in time these people will be looked
at like that.

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,880
My job and other jobs at work in kind of
what I'm doing is to put an asterisks

25
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:28,331
next to these assholes names for all
time and if people want to cry about not

26
00:01:28,761 --> 00:01:30,740
getting into like somebody they liked on
their kids

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,980
will get a fucking bigger problem.

28
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,230
It's not that complicated.
People really not.

29
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,620
It's really not.
It's easy.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,470
Read a different book.
I,

31
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:53,730
I have so many people fighting me
because they want to stay in the system.

32
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,050
The system benefits a point.
Zero,

33
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:58,771
zero,
zero,

34
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:01,440
one percent.
My ultimate goal is smashing the 99 in

35
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:02,970
the one percent.
That's what I'm here for.

36
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,870
I'm here to do that through thought and
raising women up and yes,

37
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:11,140
in in children of God,
the cult I was born into and again it

38
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:11,701
seems like,
oh,

39
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:13,230
they make a big deal of the cult.
My.

40
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:15,690
I would be talking about Ohio if that
happened to be my life.

41
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:19,350
That just was not,
but that's a cult too and I think you

42
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:21,660
all know it.
That's the thing.

43
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:21,961
You're like,
oh,

44
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:26,010
it's so weird how you grew up.
I think it's weird how you live and I

45
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:30,930
think it's tragic because by 10 percent
because there's a lot of free minds,

46
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,810
they're out there for sure,
but we have to be vigilant.

47
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,560
What if those 10 percent of the world
that you look at as the Weirdos in the

48
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:39,930
fringe people,
what if it's you guys,

49
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,310
you know,
like,

50
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:44,010
just like how African Americans have
been saying.

51
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,290
I remember hearing about it,
reading about it when I was 13,

52
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,720
you know,
that they get killed when they get

53
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:53,460
pulled over by cops and that would be
like a saint maybe because someone said

54
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:58,110
that to me in Germany recently.
I said this is like kind of what a woman

55
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,520
experiences.
And he said maybe waving his hand.

56
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,680
I thought we have like a trillion,
a trillion phds in me,

57
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:06,311
a woman.
Why?

58
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:10,120
Because we're in our skin and you know
what's sad is because when you get sold

59
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:14,050
as an idea,
the other side thinks that's what you

60
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:16,110
are.
So they were.

61
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,250
Everybody's responding to us primarily
as an idea that's sold stamps or

62
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:24,430
imagery.
You Know Adam Sandler movies where you

63
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:26,950
have sell my at Jessica Biel,
uh,

64
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,610
Kate Beckinsale,
these accomplished women with Adam

65
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,810
Sandler are Slovenly slog who shtick is
wearing dirty pants and,

66
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,920
and basically having a two point two Iq,
but the message they send out as you

67
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:43,921
deserve this and that directly with all
those young boys watching leads to the

68
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:47,520
idea of undeserved there.
No,

69
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,210
you actually deserve a complex women,
but only if you two can match that.

70
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,010
During World War II,
each studio had served their rank.

71
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,910
They served in the military.
Their rank was ministers of propaganda

72
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,700
and they came to them after the war and
they said,

73
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,650
holy crap,
women are out in the kitchen.

74
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:11,030
Why get back in?
And that's when we started seeing Doris

75
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:16,030
Day like overdrive vacuuming every ease.
Once we put video with sound images with

76
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,620
sound really taken a fast.
If you notice how fast the destruction

77
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:23,530
of the world is gone,
I know tying things together,

78
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:23,931
people are like,
oh,

79
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,210
it can't be,
can't be responsible for all of that.

80
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,493
Actually,
Karen,

81
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,510
it really,
really can.

82
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,440
There's that two year old on facebook.
That video that went around,

83
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,580
he's punching along with rocky
and everyone's like,

84
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,690
isn't that cute?
No little timmy.

85
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:41,870
There's just been stolen.
You've just stolen what he is and when

86
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:44,280
you're talking about also you're telling
them what a man is.

87
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:46,940
Just especially telling them what a
white man is and especially you're

88
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:49,410
telling them how to feel.
Why are sports so popular?

89
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:51,290
They're stupid country in.
Why?

90
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,880
Because here,
that's how men are.

91
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,060
The only time traditionally they're
allowed to have an expression of energy

92
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:02,630
or a release of energy.
Fortunately it's an anger and

93
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:06,050
aggression,
but I,

94
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,540
I.
it's a real western societal interest,

95
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:12,570
so real American problem.
I'm worse than any other place I've

96
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:15,390
been.
I've been a lot of places and I think

97
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,820
when you come from a land more time
behind it,

98
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,210
right?
America keeps going.

99
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:23,800
We're so young.
No or not white people are yelling to

100
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,690
it.
You had dummies.

101
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,560
Greg's not young.
You just renamed it.

102
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,530
You know what they did in the twenties.
I thought this was the height of a

103
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,590
American Hubris that gave native
American citizenship if Indians

104
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,720
citizenship and call them names.
You know what I mean?

105
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,850
Like that's the mentality we're dealing
with and they fight it on every level

106
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:47,580
they fight.
I don't want the Redskins logo off this.

107
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,400
I won't shut up.
Shut up.

108
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,830
Wham.
Your sports team is sad now.

109
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,070
You know,
the traditional shaming thing,

110
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,320
what have we done since Hester Brian
come on and like,

111
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,500
since you know,
I don't know,

112
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:03,860
someone called Mary in the Bible.
It did the same thing to me that they

113
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:06,860
did to marry every interview is what a
man should it.

114
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:10,940
So I understood that detail,
the funneling and the system of how we

115
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:14,160
sell ideas to people,
but you have to understand it's not just

116
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:16,610
the immediate,
it was like how my family treated me

117
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,460
based on coverage because they're
wrestling with.

118
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,790
They kind of know me,
but they think they know any more from

119
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,040
what they see in the media because
that's what they say.

120
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,610
Same with any man or woman that I've
ever been with.

121
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,380
Anything.
Friends,

122
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,970
every.
It affected everything it was,

123
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,990
but the prison wasn't mine.
I,

124
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:39,801
I,
you know,

125
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:42,560
that's the whole thing.
Unless you're actually behind bars,

126
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,430
those bars aren't there,
but we think they are as a.

127
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,930
You know,
I was on Stephen Colbert last night and

128
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:50,930
he said,
we were talking about I was wearing a

129
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:51,561
hoodie and he said,
oh,

130
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:53,020
I wish I could wear that hat to wear the
suit,

131
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,630
because I was saying I hate suits.
I feel like whenever I wear them.

132
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,000
And I was thinking maybe men are cranky
because of this,

133
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,190
because you're like a t rex.
You're hands are like,

134
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,050
you can't move.
It's not fun.

135
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:04,970
Right?
It's uncomfortable and men don't like to

136
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:06,530
be uncomfortable.
They don't like itchy things.

137
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,670
Understandably so.
That suit paradigms stupid.

138
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:11,271
And I said,
well,

139
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:12,920
what would happen to you if you didn't
wear a suit?

140
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:14,510
And he's like,
I have to wear a suit just for as long

141
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:16,040
as that.
But why?

142
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,300
And he actually said at the end,
we were talking about it after,

143
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,120
you know,
when the camera cut and like kind of

144
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,000
wonder why do I have to wear a suit?
Who says,

145
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,790
who made that rule?
Who Cares?

146
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,330
They also made the rule that it was
indiscriminate and okay to rape and

147
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:37,160
sexually assault in Hollywood.
It's also time to stop that and the

148
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:40,010
world.
That's a run on sentence.
