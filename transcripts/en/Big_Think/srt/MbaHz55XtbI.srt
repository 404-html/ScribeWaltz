1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,400
The curiosity of showing yours is,
uh,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,820
to have,
uh,

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,340
a non national point of view,
none national editorial line,

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,490
um,
when we cover a country,

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,770
which we don't take it upon themselves
to this particular country,

6
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:23,160
but to try to take the monitor from the
neighboring countries as well.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,880
Uh,
when we reported about bras,

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,490
says a converse it to other European
channels,

9
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:33,600
we don't take the national point of view
of what is doing for her,

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,870
for her.
This particular country are taking the

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,860
general interest of the European site
large and we try to understand if what

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,950
he's doing is good or bad.
Foster Europeans as a whole and not for

13
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:48,890
a particular country.
That is what makes you do,

14
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:50,850
is very specific in reporting about
Europe.

15
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,920
We present a,
both a rationale itself course,

16
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:00,630
uh,
uh,

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,860
every,
every country,

18
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:02,700
every,
uh,

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,370
both Greece and Germany has.
There are good reasons to,

20
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,401
uh,
to,

21
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,010
uh,
act as they did a.

22
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:11,370
of course a grease is 50,
44,

23
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:16,100
having accumulated so much debt and for
her not having a put in place the

24
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,110
reforms as they need.
And then now try to implement a and a

25
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,261
converse,
these,

26
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:25,980
uh,
the fact that claim form for a bit our

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,170
trough European,
your other European countries is

28
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,420
natural.
It's part of the European solidarity.

29
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,540
And nobody can contest that.
The point of Germany is that in fact

30
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,730
since the other white systems,
the richest country in Europe,

31
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,800
there is,
I've accumulated so much support or

32
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,380
other European countries that are now
where it'll fit up.

33
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,830
And so you can also understand their
point of views.

34
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:51,000
There are countries like Greece or a
neighbor to manage their,

35
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,800
uh,
their own province properly,

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,720
uh,
and um,

37
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,940
but it is also a rupture with the
traditional,

38
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:00,270
uh,
uh,

39
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:05,271
I would say I'm a common understanding
in Germany that Germany was a support in

40
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:06,210
Europe.

41
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,630
Uh,
and because of its particular history,

42
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:13,380
it was a political necessity.
So also in Germany,

43
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:16,200
there are some mixed feelings about,
uh,

44
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,400
whether a high as a country should our
net react as Mrs Parker did.

45
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,290
So in your use,
of course,

46
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:27,120
we present or facets of a story
represented on screen.

47
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:30,270
You can see people shouting the streets
of attendance.

48
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,270
You can see,
uh,

49
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,050
a German leaders,
uh,

50
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,440
saying that Greece should set,
set out the islands in order to recover

51
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:43,620
some money,
which is absolutely a crazy idea,

52
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:47,450
but we don't say it's a crazy idea which
has to report a story every present

53
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,980
because we try to,
uh,

54
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,080
to treat the viewer as an adult.
And so to present him facts as they are

55
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:59,100
and to help him making his own
assessment of the situation,

56
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,050
his own judgment.
That's what,

57
00:03:01,051 --> 00:03:02,670
uh,
we think,

58
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:04,080
uh,
is our remit.

59
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,150
And now a guitar line
is the main challenge is to,

60
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,710
to be simpler,
to be simple and attractive for the

61
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:18,510
viewer because I'm,
of course a national union hasn't

62
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,760
disappeared in Europe.
People are still very nationalist and

63
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:25,360
say they care shiftly for their own
domestic affairs.

64
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,750
So to make them to create a sense that's
a neighbor or fs are interesting for

65
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:34,820
them,
not only intellectually,

66
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,460
but also practically a if they want to
make business with neighboring countries

67
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:42,120
and also European countries,
if they want to travel to,

68
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,130
uh,
to,

69
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,410
to be altruistic reasons,
for instance,

70
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,250
they need to understand that the better.
So we try to make it simple and

71
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:53,251
attractive for every European watching
your used to have an eye on what to and,

72
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,360
and to try to,
to,

73
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,730
to,
to catch a with a better understanding

74
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:04,660
of the situation abroad.
That's not easy because people,

75
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,150
uh,
like everywhere in the world I think.

76
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:07,900
But,
uh,

77
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,733
in Europe,
uh,

78
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,920
one could think that there is more
clarity,

79
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:14,560
feelings and is the rest of the world,
but it's not really the case.

80
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:16,360
In fact,
everybody's very nationalistic.

81
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,820
And so you have to create these feelings
that every,

82
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,980
some solidarity between people.
That's not easy.
