1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,610
People sometimes ask what does it all
mean?

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,750
And that's a very hard question to
address because it's not clear what an

3
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:11,400
answer would look like.
A question that I found much more

4
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:16,401
fruitful that I think one can address
sensitively is does the world and body

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:21,651
beautiful ideas.
That's a question we can address on both

6
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:25,110
sides.
What is the world and what is beauty?

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,850
What is the world of course is the kind
of question that science addresses.

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,570
What is beauty is something that art and
philosophy and a human culture

9
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,130
addresses.
And so we can look at the record of what

10
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:45,690
people have found beautiful,
what they were hoping for in their

11
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:50,580
understanding of the world,
with what the remarkable understanding

12
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:54,600
of the world we've achieved in recent
years looks like.

13
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,950
And we can therefore a frame,
a meaningful discussion and a meaningful

14
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:03,270
question,
a meaningful meditation on the issue of

15
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,340
does the world embodied beautiful ideas.

16
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,220
Some of the things that people,
uh,

17
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,180
at the beginning of this adventure we're
hoping for and uh,

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,200
had in their visions was in [inaudible]
the idea that the world embodies

19
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,610
harmonies.
That he talked about a music of the

20
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:28,680
spheres.
Plato,

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,460
uh,
had a theory of Adam's based on the so

22
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:36,510
called Platonic solids,
which are very symmetric objects.

23
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,870
They were hoping that our sense of
harmony,

24
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:43,430
so somehow agreed with what nature,
uh,

25
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,860
likes to use and her construction of the
world.

26
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,210
And more specifically with,
uh,

27
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:55,211
with Plato and the platonic solids,
the idea that ideas that symmetry and

28
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:58,410
mathematical perfection,
uh,

29
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,120
provide the building principals that the
world embodies

30
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,130
those themes which,
uh,

31
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,690
Pythagoras and Plato articulated very
well in the early days,

32
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,440
uh,
have inspired people for centuries,

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,510
uh,
prior to the modern times when we found

34
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,640
that nature does in fact use those
ideas.

35
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,900
Visual imagery is very important to our
understanding of the world because

36
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,480
humans are intensely visual creatures.

37
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,240
Uh,
depending on how you do the accounting

38
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,810
between 20 and 50% of our brain is
devoted to processing visual information

39
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,260
and we have some very impressive
capabilities in that direction we face

40
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:55,070
in interpreting the world a very
challenging problem that we're good at

41
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,530
solving.
We're so good at it.

42
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,810
With that,
we don't consciously realize how

43
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:05,440
difficult it is.
That's the problem of taking the

44
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:10,180
electromagnetic radiation,
the light that impinges on our retina,

45
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,480
giving a two dimensional image that's
all scrambled and interpreting that as a

46
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:21,070
three worlds of three dimensional
objects moving around in three

47
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:25,450
dimensional space.
That's a very difficult,

48
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:27,760
in fact,
impossible mathematical problem.

49
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,050
But we have many sophisticated tricks,
uh,

50
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,170
and rules of thumb plus a systematic,
uh,

51
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,250
although unconscious knowledge of
projective geometry so that we can

52
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:46,840
recognize that the same thing seen from
different positions is,

53
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,160
is this represents the same object.
These were,

54
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,610
uh,
when they were made conscious as a

55
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,670
geometric theorems and discoveries,
astonishing achievements that,

56
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,030
uh,
when Brunelleschi discovered the science

57
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:08,260
of perspective.
And in 1420 help kicked off kickoff the

58
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:09,970
glorious,
uh,

59
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,090
episode of the Italian Renaissance and
has been,

60
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,510
uh,
a foundation of art ever since.
