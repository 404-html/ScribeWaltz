1
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,540
Well,
I don't know if there's a single model

2
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:14,850
we'd want to learn from.
I think you want to take bits and pieces

3
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:15,600
from,
from,

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,980
from a number of different models.
But I think if you look to Europe,

5
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:22,680
I mean some of the things you could say
pretty much across the board,

6
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:24,990
I'm thinking Western Europe,
obviously the countries that are closest

7
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:28,530
to the u s and living standards that
they do work many fewer hours.

8
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:30,120
And that is something that I think
people,

9
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:33,240
their value,
the idea I know may Europeans,

10
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,021
they're,
they're amazed.

11
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:35,070
They,
they I think made them,

12
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:38,400
don't even believe me when I say that
people here don't have the cations.

13
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:39,360
I mean,
obviously a lot of people do,

14
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:42,330
but there are many tens of millions of
people that don't and there's certainly

15
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:44,280
no guarantee of a vacation.
Um,

16
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:48,360
so paid time off that people know they
could get four or five weeks vacation,

17
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:49,740
which is absolutely standard in Europe.

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,350
Some countries,
Denmark has six weeks.

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,600
Um,
so I think that's something that that's

20
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:56,670
very valuable.
Give people time off.

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,511
Um,
again,

22
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:59,130
parental leave,
uh,

23
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,550
this is conservatives like to see a
women stay home with their kids.

24
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:04,830
I don't care whether it's women or men,
but the idea that people have that

25
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,040
option,
I think that's very good because it's,

26
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:10,200
it's a real strain for people to juggle
a job and work.

27
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,480
Um,
so that makes a big difference.

28
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,830
Um,
energy use a Europe across Europe,

29
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:18,780
average energy use,
greenhouse gas emissions,

30
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:22,770
about half of what is the United States.
So even though they're very comparable

31
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:23,910
living standards,
they use much,

32
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:26,160
much less energy.
Part of that is that they have more mass

33
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:28,710
transit.
Part of is it's more concentrated,

34
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:30,570
uh,
people live closer together,

35
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:31,780
which,
uh,

36
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,860
people wrongly in the United States,
it's because we're such a big country

37
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:35,940
that's really not the case.

38
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,240
And obviously we're a big country,
but that's not why we're so spread out.

39
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:42,090
We have land use policies that basically
promotes sprawl.

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,310
And in Europe,
they've quite consciously designed

41
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:47,010
policies that have been intended to
fight sprawl.

42
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,280
And I think it would make sense for the
United States to do that as well.

43
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:52,980
Make it easier for people live in the
cities.

44
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:56,010
Um,
make it easier or near in suburbs rather

45
00:01:56,011 --> 00:02:00,240
than build out 90 miles,
have people commuting an hour and a half

46
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:03,210
each way each day.
So a number of different practices that

47
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:05,220
we could take from across Europe.
And again,

48
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:07,770
I don't think any single country we'd
want to hold up as a model,

49
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:11,910
but I think they're common practices
that take different forms that we could

50
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:13,500
look to across Europe,
Canada,

51
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:14,131
all.
So I mean,

52
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:15,180
it's not just Europe.
Uh,

53
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:18,840
we really are the outlier among the
wealthy countries in a wide range of

54
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:19,674
areas.

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,790
The World Bank I think is often played a
fairly pernicious role over the last few

56
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,420
decades.
Uh,

57
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,620
billy,
uh,

58
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,650
supporting a lot of bad projects,
development projects and make great

59
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:35,080
example here is Chad building an oil
pipeline.

60
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:37,240
There were,
everyone knew what the garment Chad was

61
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,860
corrupt and the world make bank made a
big,

62
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,120
big point of insisting that they were
going to have all these safeguards to

63
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,210
ensure that the,
the money from the pipeline went to,

64
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:47,920
uh,
helping the poor people in Chad,

65
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:49,180
one of the poorest countries in the
world.

66
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,670
And Lo and behold,
what happened was the money went to the

67
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,290
government.
They used it to buy arms.

68
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:53,981
Um,
you know,

69
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:55,480
that,
that's just an example.

70
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:56,950
I mean,
they've had things like that all over

71
00:02:56,951 --> 00:03:00,130
the world.
They've also promoted and a wide range

72
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:02,680
of areas where I think it was often
inappropriate at one,

73
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:05,380
I'm most familiar with the social
security in Latin America where they've

74
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,750
got an almost every country in Latin
America.

75
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,470
Brazil is the big exception to either
wholly or partially privatized their

76
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:15,100
social security system.
And almost invariably it's led to very

77
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:17,050
high costs,
poor coverage rates,

78
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,200
really not very good outcomes.
And they've done that with water

79
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,620
systems.
So they,

80
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:25,330
they very much promoted an agenda,
which certainly serves a lot of

81
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:28,930
corporate interests,
often has not served the people who

82
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:30,790
they're supposed to serve,
which is the poor of the world.

83
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,580
So in principle,
I mean the World Bank's mission if you

84
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,620
go into the building.
And it really is kind of remarkable

85
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:37,300
because it's a very opulent building.
I mean,

86
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,310
no one objects to people having nice
offices,

87
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,890
but it's really quite opulent with this
big fountain,

88
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:43,300
big atrium.
And,

89
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,070
um,
up on the wall it says,

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,800
our dream is a world free of poverty.
And it's,

91
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,850
it's just a,
it's a,

92
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:51,790
it's amazing they did that and there's
no sense of irony to that.

93
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,901
Um,
anyhow,

94
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:54,580
I mean,
their mission is a very noble one.

95
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:56,830
Unfortunately.
I just don't see them having done very

96
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:57,760
much to advance it.
Okay.

97
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,070
[inaudible].
