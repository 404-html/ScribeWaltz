1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,840
Well,
I will answer the question with the

2
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:13,080
caveat that I've been on the job all
four months now,

3
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:18,081
and so I'm trying to understand that at
greater depth and see how it needs to be

4
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:21,180
shaped going forward.
But the basics are these,

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,410
there are four national,
three national academies,

6
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:28,200
uh,
here in the US National Academy of

7
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:30,990
Science,
National Academy of Engineering,

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,300
and the Institute of Medicine,
uh,

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,980
collectively we operate something called
the National Research Council.

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,850
Now in a nutshell,
the academies are chartered by the US

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,930
Congress to be literally the advisors to
the nation in science,

12
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:53,931
engineering and medicine.
So sort of core activities of the

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,310
National Academy of Engineering are
threefold.

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,050
One is simply an honorific organization
through a,

15
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:01,800
a,
a,

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,160
almost byzantine but very detailed
process.

17
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,210
We try to select and elect as,
as a membership,

18
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,810
the most accomplished engineers in the
country from both academia and industry

19
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:16,710
and,
and elsewhere.

20
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,230
So honorific,
uh,

21
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:23,440
then we also administer a number of
major prizes,

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,580
particularly the draper prize,
which is sort of the highest a prize

23
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:31,490
that the private sector gives for,
uh,

24
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,530
engineering,
uh,

25
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,390
accomplishment.

26
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,150
That's gone.
The people who invented the jet engine

27
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:41,151
in the world wide web and so forth,
and then the bulk of our work,

28
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:45,570
however,
is in producing reports on specific

29
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:48,510
topics generally requested by the
congress,

30
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:53,511
sometimes by the administration,
sometimes by ourselves on technological

31
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:58,680
issues facing the country,
either very specific or sometimes much

32
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:03,660
broader and try to provide that advice
to how we keep a sound,

33
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:08,661
a technological leadership in the US.
So day to day is really a lot like day

34
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:15,321
to day was as a university president if
you take away the students and you take

35
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:21,351
away the sometimes heavy emotional
pressures that one feels as a university

36
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:25,800
president.
So I'm delighted to say that I'm always

37
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:27,580
around bright people,
uh,

38
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,230
because we always have groups coming in
and out to do studies,

39
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,630
uh,
leaders from industry leaders from

40
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:38,610
university worrying about generally
large important,

41
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:39,300
uh,
uh,

42
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,300
problems and trying to help shepherd
that process along to get the right

43
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,400
people to do the right studies.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,520
And then to help promulgate a,
uh,

45
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,040
what we find is sort of what constitutes
a,

46
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,370
the day to day a business that at the
Naa,

47
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,500
he and I have to tell you at least so
far,

48
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,530
I'm also traveling a lot.
I was on the road 36 days the last two

49
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:07,570
months,
giving speeches,

50
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:08,740
uh,
um,

51
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,500
uh,
helping to run meetings,

52
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:13,630
giving awards,
all these kinds of things.

53
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:15,030
So it's not a,
a,

54
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,860
a slow retirement,
a retirement job.

55
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,550
I accepted this honor because I feel
that the future of this nation,

56
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:31,201
and indeed the world is increasingly
dependent on having sound technological

57
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:38,221
leadership and strong science and
engineering and medicine undergirding

58
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,940
our public policy.
What our industries are doing.

59
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,390
And I'm particularly interested in the
opportunities to help people think about

60
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:53,521
what the evolving global context of all
this is and what our opportunities are,

61
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,180
particularly for the next generation of
young people.
