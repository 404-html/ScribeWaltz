1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,653
No,

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,070
no,
I don't agree.

3
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:14,071
I people have been attacking Alan
Greenspan pretty vigorously in the press

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,130
lately,
and a lane.

5
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:21,220
The whole blame for the credit crisis at
his feet.

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,410
So what I think about that is it is two
things.

7
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:30,850
One is that in the 19 nineties,
Alan Greenspan could do no wrong.

8
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:35,851
He was hailed as the maestro.
Bob Woodward wrote a book called the

9
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,550
Maestro.
Um,

10
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,320
and uh,
Bob Woodward said,

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,480
you know,
at the end of the wizard of Oz,

12
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:47,260
when the man comes out behind the from
behind the curtain,

13
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:51,340
when the wizard chose his face,
we feel a little bit underwhelmed.

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,690
But with Alan Greenspan,
we always feel safe or something like

15
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:58,960
that.
I think they gave him too much credit

16
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,990
for monetary policies when times were
good because when times are good things,

17
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:09,690
when the economy is strong,
a monetary policy is really sort of

18
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:15,100
boring.
But what Alan Greenspan did and realized

19
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:20,080
was he just got out of the way and let
productivity drive the economy.

20
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,890
And,
but where the real test of a central

21
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:28,891
banker it comes is when the usual rule
books don't apply when you're not just

22
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:33,370
making monetary policy for,
for

23
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,050
ordinary times,
but where when you're subject to

24
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,690
some fundamental strains on the
financial system.

25
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,970
And Greenspan faced several such
incidents.

26
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,980
The first was October of 1987 when the
stock market collapsed.

27
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Another was the Asian financial crisis
in the 19 nineties,

28
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,630
the Russian bond default in the 19
nineties,

29
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,960
there was the collapse of longterm
capital management and the 19 nineties

30
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:12,570
there was 9:11.
And in all of those cases,

31
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,410
Alan Greenspan understood what the,
what the role of the central bank was,

32
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:22,411
was to provide enough liquidity and keep
the financial system functioning.

33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,340
And because he knew enough because he
did that in those instances,

34
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:31,390
he came out of those crises with his
reputation is enhanced.

35
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,950
And uh,
and that was his real genius,

36
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:40,220
was to know what to do when the system
was,

37
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,080
was in a severe crisis.
And for all those reasons,

38
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:48,370
the shocks that were felt than didn't
become the new normal.

39
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:54,210
So the charge against him is in lately
has been that he kept interest rates too

40
00:02:56,561 --> 00:03:01,561
low for too long,
but when he left office there wasn't a

41
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:06,170
lot of inflation.
So there's a real question about what do

42
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:10,120
you mean by interest rates being too low
for too long?

43
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,380
It was not the case that he caused the
housing bubble.

44
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,860
Having interest rates low doesn't mean
you have to make unwise loans.

45
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,810
Nor nor did he encouraged people to
assume that prices could only go up and

46
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:28,870
up.
So I think he's a convenient scapegoat.
