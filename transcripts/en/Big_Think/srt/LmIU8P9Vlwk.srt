1
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,870
Do you need to think strategically about
how you're going to organize,

2
00:00:11,871 --> 00:00:14,150
manage,
and lead the enterprise to enable,

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,010
uh,
and adaptive,

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,330
resilient,
uh,

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,190
organization with high commitment and
the capacity to innovate and Change

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,960
Michael Beer,
professor emeritus at the Harvard

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,640
Business School and Chairman of true
point

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,360
leaders of these or of these
organizations have made and those who

9
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:37,240
aspire to,
to build these firms need to make a

10
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:42,241
number of critical choices.
The first and foremost choice is about

11
00:00:42,581 --> 00:00:45,730
what is the purpose of the organization.
Uh,

12
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:51,270
is it to increase shareholder wealth and
stop there?

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,700
Or is it more than that?
Most high commitment,

14
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:57,610
high performance with high commitment,
high performance organizations have a

15
00:00:57,611 --> 00:01:02,320
multistakeholder perspective.
They see their task as achieving

16
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:04,600
profitability.
That's very important.

17
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,480
It's essential for survival.
It's essential for,

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,870
uh,
for satisfying one of their critical

19
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,490
constituencies,
the investor,

20
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,490
uh,
but they also aspire to,

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,710
uh,
to create commitment,

22
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,950
not only investors,
but in customers and employees,

23
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:23,120
importantly and employees,
and in the,

24
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,070
and,
and to,

25
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,620
and to be concerned about the community
and society as,

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,820
as a,
as a whole.

27
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,010
Uh,
and,

28
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:34,090
uh,
so the choice of purpose and the choice

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,080
of,
of,

30
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,030
of,
of values that reflect that multi

31
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:41,470
stakeholder perspective is an,
is an essential first step,

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,510
uh,
in the development of affirm.

33
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,670
Uh,
without that philosophy.

34
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:47,280
Without that viewpoint,
uh,

35
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,470
you can get human resource departments
to do all kinds of things with policies

36
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:51,880
and practices,
you will not succeed.

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,260
Uh,
the second important choice they make is

38
00:01:56,261 --> 00:02:00,160
about strategy.
A high commitment,

39
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:04,600
high performance organizations are
characterized by an increment,

40
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,890
illogical incrementalism as uh,
as a,

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,190
uh,
one of my one researcher once called it

42
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,760
logical incrementalism in their
strategic evolution over time.

43
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,320
Uh,
they don't,

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,990
uh,
they don't strike out into areas that

45
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:21,430
they are not,
they have any capabilities.

46
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:25,510
Then they stretched their capabilities,
they develop their capabilities and they

47
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:30,511
move into adjacent areas and grow that
way off core capabilities.

48
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,700
Uli Packard again would be a great
example.

49
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,490
Uh,
a core technology and test and

50
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:41,491
measurement led them to improve things
for the customer that led them to begin

51
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:45,700
to develop computer computer
capabilities were,

52
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,010
uh,
information processing capabilities

53
00:02:48,011 --> 00:02:49,780
because that was part of building
better,

54
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,640
better tested measurement organizations.
And then they began to apply those same

55
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,300
ideas in a newer of a ways into both the
computer business,

56
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,070
the server,
and ultimately,

57
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,570
and,
and in the printing business,

58
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:02,910
which was an offshoot of,
of,

59
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:04,240
of the soda,
that whole approach.

60
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,700
Uh,
so an incremental,

61
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,190
logical,
incremental ism in their strategy.

62
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,140
A strategy that both puts emphasis on
exploitation and on exploration.

63
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,860
One of the problems with companies that
fail is either focused on exploitation.

64
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,240
Let's make the most money we can,
let's not worry about innovation and the

65
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,680
future.
Uh,

66
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,040
or they focused entirely on exploration,
uh,

67
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,870
new ideas,
new technology,

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,860
but they don't focus on,
on,

69
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,703
on,
on,

70
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,360
on exploitation,
and therefore their profit margins go

71
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:34,690
down.

72
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,210
And eventually they are forced to make
decisions that are not,

73
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,590
uh,
not good for them.

74
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,450
Uh,
not good for the long run.

75
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,270
The third element is risk management.
And we've seen that in spades in,

76
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:46,130
in the,
uh,

77
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,830
two Oh eight,
two Oh nine period,

78
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,300
uh,
with the economic,

79
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,400
uh,
with the deepest recession we've had

80
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:53,200
since the depression,
uh,

81
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,970
firms at a high commitment,
high performance organizations take very

82
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,030
measured risks.
And I'm saying they're not taking risks.

83
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,760
They take measured risks and carefully
considered risks,

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,640
some characteristics of them.
For example,

85
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:09,520
then I found in found Hewlett Packard
southwest airlines.

86
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:12,340
I just interviewed Gary Kelly,
the CEO of southwest airlines,

87
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:13,990
and about six,
nine months ago.

88
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,520
Uh,
they,

89
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,840
for example,
they are characterized by very careful

90
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:21,160
management of debt.
In fact,

91
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,940
HP had no debt ever other than short
term debt.

92
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,910
Uh,
southwest airlines characterized by the

93
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:29,350
same thing,
uh,

94
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,840
no longterm debt.
In other words,

95
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:35,170
just to self financing idea here.
Now in some industries,

96
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:37,570
that's not entirely possible,
but,

97
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,410
but you,
you live as close to that set of ideas

98
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:42,100
as you can.
