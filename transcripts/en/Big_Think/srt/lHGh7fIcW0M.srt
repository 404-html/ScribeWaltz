00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,230
I think one of the most important
findings in my book and my research is

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:08,640
that innovator is fundamentally
misunderstand human capital as an asset,

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,470
human capital,
as a resource.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,530
The majority of organizations that want
to innovate,

5
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:17,790
say we need to get innovators,
we need to improve the capabilities and

6
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:21,960
competencies of our employees.
We need to hire people who are willing

7
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:23,490
to take a chance,
et cetera.

8
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:26,040
It's such and be innovative and the
whole notion of,

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,910
you know,
our competitive advantage in this post

10
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:33,540
industrial era is that we have better
human capital than our competitors.

11
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,900
You know,
Google has better people than IBM has

12
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:39,420
better people than apple has better
people than Amazon and blah,

13
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:39,691
blah,
blah,

14
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:39,961
blah,
blah,

15
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:40,794
blah,
blah.

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,760
I submit that's the exact wrong way to
look at it.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,810
Not that it's wrong in the sense of
false but wrong in the way of being

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,673
incomplete.

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,000
What about your customers?
Human capital.

20
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,660
What about your clients?
Human capital,

21
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,580
the Good Duncan experiment,
the thought experiment I want people to

22
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:06,270
get very,
very serious consideration to is what if

23
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:11,040
we stopped thinking of innovation as
something that's new and valuable that

24
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,920
we market and sell,
and what if we start thinking about

25
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,950
innovation as an investment in the human
capital capabilities and competencies of

26
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:23,100
our customers?
Yes,

27
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,080
Henry Ford transformed the factory
production system with mass production

28
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:29,960
of the automobile,
the model t,

29
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:33,810
the model a,
etc. And everybody celebrates that as a

30
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,220
milestone in business history,
I submit that economic historians,

31
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,360
business historians,
marketers miss the essential point.

32
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,930
Henry ford didn't just enAble the mass
production of automobiles.

33
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,480
He facilitated the mass creation of the
human capital of driving.

34
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,090
everybody drives.
It's an asset.

35
00:01:57,091 --> 00:02:01,410
It transforms markets.
It transforms individual and

36
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,470
organizational capabilities.
Why do we not spend as much time

37
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:11,661
focusing on the human capital and adding
value to the human capital of our

38
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:16,200
customers and our clients as opposed to
our employees.

39
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,380
I think that's the essential innovation
takeaway.

40
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,970
How do our innovations transform the
human capital of our customers,

41
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,830
not just the human capital of the people
who work for us and with us.

42
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,900
The reason why I came up with a design
horistic making customers better makes

43
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:38,901
better customers is because I wanted to
help innovative organizations filter and

44
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:45,651
prioritize their innovation investments.
it's not enough to make your customer

45
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,430
better if you don't reap the benefits of
that investment.

46
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,000
Conversely,
if we're just making it better customer,

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,150
that's exploitation,
so what you're trying to do is align an

48
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:06,151
innovation investment that makes your
customer measurably better in some way

49
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,700
that matters to that customer in some
ways that matters for that client,

50
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,130
but at the same time,
at the same time,

51
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:15,550
you're making that customer more
valuable to themselves.

52
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,060
you're making them more valuable to you
by making them a better customer.

53
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,550
You're making them a better customer for
you.

54
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,180
Making customers better makes better
customers.
