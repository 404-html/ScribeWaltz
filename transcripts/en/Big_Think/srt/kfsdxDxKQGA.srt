1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,460
I'm not sure how much,
uh,

2
00:00:09,461 --> 00:00:13,120
what I wish men knew about women that
they don't,

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,220
I think it's,
I think men can do a better job of

4
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:19,100
really listening to women.
I think a lot of times,

5
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:21,110
you know,
there's an old Chinese saying called

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,160
Tang,
um,

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,150
I think I'm getting this right.
And it means to listen with your heart,

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,050
your ear and your mind.
And I think sometimes when people

9
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:31,020
listen,
they,

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,230
they don't listen with their full
selves.

11
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:34,850
You know,
this is what emotional intelligence is

12
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:37,190
all about.
I think women give a lot of,

13
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:39,780
you know,
set something like 70% of communication

14
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:42,800
is nonverbal.
And that can be completely irrational to

15
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:43,550
some people.
Like,

16
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,090
tell me exactly what you want to say.
So I think if men would listen with

17
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:47,751
their heads,
heart,

18
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:50,690
and mind altogether,
I think they'd have better relationships

19
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:51,680
with,
you know,

20
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:52,580
their,
their partners,

21
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:54,020
their mother's,
whoever it is.

22
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:56,810
But I also think that the world would be
a much better place.
