1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,650
Culture is,
uh,

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,560
frankly,
um,

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:14,170
one of the reasons why many of the
developing nations of the world continue

4
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:19,171
to kind of depend on handouts for the,
because they do not have an agricultural

5
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:25,150
infrastructure that allows them to be
self sufficient in food production is,

6
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:27,130
and,
and in the area of global trade,

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,470
um,
we really do not have very much free

8
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:32,290
trade and agriculture because it's an
interesting phenomena.

9
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:35,020
No matter how,
no matter how rich or country is,

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,500
most farmers will want to protect what
they have inside.

11
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:41,170
It's as true of America.
It's true of the UK,

12
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:43,360
it's true of Europe.
It's true of China's true of everywhere

13
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:45,940
else.
So agriculture is probably the reason

14
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:50,941
why we cannot move very aggressively on
a new global trade round.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,730
The agricultural interests are,
are pretty down on.

16
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,870
Well,
I think in the area of agriculture,

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,280
uh,
you know,

18
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:02,430
uh,
what we as a nation have to do this

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,160
after recognize that vast areas of the
world has subsistence agriculture and

20
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,830
our policies tend to hurt that because
of the way we subsidize our products.

21
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:14,860
I don't want to make an overall
statement because some are more in that

22
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:17,770
area than an than others.
And not every one of our programs is

23
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:19,000
bad.
But,

24
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,980
um,
agriculture is unique.

25
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:24,160
The politics of agriculture is unlike
any in the rest of the world.

26
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,110
You can be talking to the most liberal,
progressive politician in America or

27
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:34,111
Japan or in Europe on anything else.
And you mentioned dairy or cotton or

28
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:38,350
sugar,
and it's like they turned from Dr Jekyll

29
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:39,640
and Mr. Hyde.
It's just,

30
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,760
it's just the way of the world and has
probably always been that way.

31
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:46,690
And part of it is this natural
predilection to protect your farmers and

32
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:47,530
your food supply.
