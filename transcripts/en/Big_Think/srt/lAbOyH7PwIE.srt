1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:04,581
Well,
I mean,

2
00:00:04,581 --> 00:00:08,740
I think that's always sort of the fun
part about the story about deal stories

3
00:00:08,741 --> 00:00:13,741
is that they often have this almost
movie like quality to them where they're

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:19,050
meeting in secret hotel rooms and there
have project code words and you have

5
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:22,420
teams of people,
oftentimes hundreds of people who are

6
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:25,660
under this kind of a cone of silence and
you know,

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,290
how they make a deal happen or not.
Oftentimes there's not just two people

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,140
coming together in a friendly way.
There's multiple bidders.

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,010
Someone is the jilted lover who doesn't
get their,

10
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:36,580
uh,
it doesn't get the bride.

11
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,040
And so there really is a great story
here,

12
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,290
but you know,
you asked how do these deals really come

13
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,560
together?
I think in one way,

14
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,400
in every situation somebody is looking
for an opportunity.

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,770
Everyone in the deal world is an
opportunist,

16
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:54,400
so they're looking at the stock price.
They're looking at the relationship

17
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:57,190
between the CEO and the board.
They're looking at whether the CEO is

18
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,080
about to be ousted and maybe there's an
opportunity to come in then and there.

19
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:01,600
They're looking for weakness,
frankly,

20
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,010
oftentimes.
And,

21
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,280
you know,
all of that collectively is,

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,360
is,
is the great soap opera that makes my

23
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:07,950
job so much

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,783
fun.

25
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,000
You know,
what,

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,080
what's made this actually so interesting
is that the deal landscape,

27
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:19,550
if you will,
the players,

28
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,860
uh,
and the importance of the relative

29
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:25,340
importance of each player has changed
dramatically in the past,

30
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,830
say 12 or 18 months or 12 months ago.
The most important people on the planet

31
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,110
were these people called private equity,
which is sort of a misnomer for what

32
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,240
would otherwise,
or a polite way to describe Lbo is or,

33
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:42,800
or leveraged buyouts,
which is sort of a less polite word that

34
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:44,930
people didn't like in the eighties.
But you know,

35
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,310
whether it was Henry Kravis or Steve
Schwarzman from blackstone or the guys

36
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:53,210
at tpg or Carlyle in Washington,
these guys with the power players,

37
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:56,540
they were the hitters because they had
amassed all this money and we're

38
00:01:56,541 --> 00:02:00,530
spending it at,
at outrigger outrageous songs at an

39
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:04,700
outrageous pace.
And you saw some very big blue chip

40
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:05,910
companies,
uh,

41
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,740
get taken out,
get bought in these massive buyouts.

42
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,300
Um,
you know,

43
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,750
now that we've had this credit crunch,
a,

44
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,920
they still have cash,
but they can't,

45
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,690
they can't add the steroids,
right?

46
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:22,130
They can't add the juice that makes
their formula work and therefore they're

47
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:26,310
sort of sidelined and now you're seeing
big corporations big what they call

48
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,870
strategic players come in and start
making deals.

49
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:33,710
They had sort of been cast aside because
they couldn't afford to pay the premiums

50
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:35,510
that private equity was paying.
And frankly,

51
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:38,630
it's unclear where the private equity
should've been paying those premiums to

52
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:40,310
begin with.
We'll see how those deals work out.

53
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:41,330
But you know,
now,

54
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,790
you know,
in the news there's rumors about Inbev,

55
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:47,750
the beer distributor in beer
manufacturer trying to buy budweiser,

56
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,880
for example,
a anheuser busch.

57
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:50,870
That is.
And so,

58
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,000
you know,
that's a big strategic deal,

59
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,100
uh,
that about a year ago probably wouldn't

60
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:57,050
have happened.
So you're seeing sort of major

61
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,880
corporations,
I think that had sort of been,

62
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,810
hadn't really been thinking about
acquisitions because they didn't know

63
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:03,610
how to compete against private equity.
Is,

64
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,300
is the new power player.
So it's no longer a cabal of 10 or five

65
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:10,810
guys from the private equity world who
are going to rule the world for the next

66
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,670
couple of years.
It's really the CEO's of big

67
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:15,940
corporations and the bankers and lawyers
behind the scenes that are making these

68
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:16,774
deals happen.

69
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,800
Hot Sector is always a dangerous
question because,

70
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:27,400
uh,
it,

71
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,250
you can never get the answer right.
Just when you think it's hard.

72
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,600
It's not,
um,

73
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,510
you know,
I think right now you're going to see

74
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,770
transactions in the financial,
what they call financial services banks.

75
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,620
Everybody needs rescue financing.
You saw this,

76
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,560
all the banks go through this period in
November,

77
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:48,970
December where they wrote down billions
upon tens of billions of dollars and

78
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:53,740
they needed more cash to keep up,
to stay afloat frankly.

79
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,080
And you saw them go,
what they say go to the desert.

80
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,120
They would,
they would go to the Middle East and

81
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:00,010
raise money.
I think you're going to see a lot more

82
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:01,900
of that over the next couple of weeks,
frankly.

83
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,410
And I think you're also going to see
banks that need to consolidate and

84
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,990
there's always been consolidation than
financial services area,

85
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:09,850
but I think you're gonna see more and
more of that.

86
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:14,650
Obviously bear stearns in trouble goes
in and is now owned by JP Morgan,

87
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:18,670
but you're going to see countrywide gets
bought by a bank of America.

88
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,370
These are deals that are not going to be
with the calls from strength to

89
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:22,330
strength.
These are,

90
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,340
these are,
these are truly going to be distressed

91
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:27,780
deals were some,
some strong players taking over

92
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:31,150
distressed player and is seeing as we
talked about being an opportunistic,

93
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,490
being an opportunist,
you know,

94
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,470
really trying to take advantage of a
situation.
