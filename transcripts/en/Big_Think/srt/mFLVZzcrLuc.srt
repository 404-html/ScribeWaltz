1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,183
Mm,

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,820
it's interesting question,
what is sort of impossible to define,

3
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:13,660
but sociologists have tried and their
definition I think is really useful.

4
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:18,661
Their definition is that coolness is a
measured positive rebellion against an

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,210
illegitimate mainstream and like
thinking of that all in one big pile is

6
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:29,380
a little bit complicated,
but when you disentangle that it makes a

7
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:32,770
lot of sense.
It is a measured small rebellion.

8
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:36,580
A little difference or distinction from
mainstream that is considered

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,630
illegitimate or bad.
Coolness is a response to a mainstream.

10
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,040
It is in many ways very similar to the
sociological definition of a cult.

11
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,320
A cult is also a measured rebellion to a
mainstream that is considered

12
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,860
legitimate.
Maybe the best way to think about this

13
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:57,630
definition is to think about it through
the lens of dress codes for high

14
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:58,464
schools,
right?

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,710
Lots of high schoolers when they attend
a school that has addressed code,

16
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:07,000
they try to break from that code,
but only in ways that are measured and

17
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:07,540
positive.

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,580
Right?
So the dress code says you have to wear

19
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:13,450
a coat with a tie and a button up shirt.
Maybe they'll undo the tie a bit or wear

20
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:16,540
a hat or undo their button up shirt.
They'll have measured,

21
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,270
measured rebellions to that illegitimate
mainstream,

22
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,690
but it's not cool to go to school naked.
It's not cool to go to school dressed in

23
00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:26,051
some like,
you know,

24
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:28,750
like some sort of weird superhero for
Tuesday.

25
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,160
That's not a measured rebellion that is
outright rebellion and that is not

26
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:35,860
considered cool.
So you need a measured rebellion,

27
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:37,630
number one,
but number two,

28
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,830
the mainstream has to be considered
legitimate in the first place in order

29
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:43,270
for the action to be considered.
Cool.

30
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,910
So in one study,
these researchers is something really

31
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:48,580
clever.
They told a bunch of students who are,

32
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,610
who were departing from the mainstream,
a dress code,

33
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:56,611
and in various ways they told them the
dress code was a initiated to honor a

34
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,380
high school graduate who had died
overseas in a war.

35
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,370
Now suddenly that dress code wasn't
legitimate.

36
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,810
It was a completely legitimate way for
people to honor a fallen soldier and

37
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:12,940
fewer students considered departing from
that dress code to be cool.

38
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,450
So it's very important to think when
defining coolness that you need two

39
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:18,730
parts.
First you need to mainstream that is

40
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:21,430
considered bad.
People need to agree that the mainstream

41
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:23,050
is bad,
and two,

42
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,020
you need the rebellion to be positive
and measured.

43
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,630
It can't be crazy.
It can't be insane.

44
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,060
And when you have those two things
together,

45
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,220
you have cool the difference between
that which we consider cool and that

46
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:40,330
which we consider cultish because
they're relatively similar things.

47
00:02:40,331 --> 00:02:43,540
They're both departing from a mainstream
is essentially degree.

48
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,140
That culture all designed around this
idea that most human beings are,

49
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:54,640
most people in society don't get you or
they don't get this important thing.

50
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,670
They're not religious enough,
they're not thoughtful enough.

51
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,440
They're not environmental enough has to
be sort of the first principle of that

52
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:05,950
cult.
But we reserve the word cult for

53
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:10,090
essentially groups that are too far away
from the mainstream to be considered a

54
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:13,900
measured rebellion from it.
And so I think that's exactly the right

55
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:15,970
way to think about coolness versus
cultish Nus,

56
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:18,990
is that we're all part of cults were all
part of scent.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,020
We all disagree with some aspect of
mainstream social or political thought,

58
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,490
but the but whether or not other people
consider us cool there cultish

59
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:31,000
essentially depends on whether they
think that we are departing from that

60
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,000
mainstream in a way that is measured and
positive.
