1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,930
If what you're saying now,
especially with Hulu,

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,610
but,
uh,

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,990
you know,
before that with youtube and with,

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,220
um,
you know,

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,300
network sites like nbc.com and so forth,
um,

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,280
is,
uh,

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,470
you know,
the availability of,

8
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:26,270
of,
of online video,

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,160
you know,
uh,

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,000
with uh,
you know,

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,730
more and more ubiquitous broadband
connections.

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,950
Um,
you know,

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,270
video becomes something that's,
uh,

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,300
you know,
easy to get online and,

15
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,150
and very compelling.
You know,

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,720
the idea that you can watch anything you
want whenever you want it is,

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,231
uh,
you know,

18
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:47,360
that has a lot of appeal for obvious
reasons.

19
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,660
Um,
and um,

20
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,090
television obviously isn't set up that
way.

21
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,760
Uh,
you know,

22
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:56,480
and frankly,
the cable companies,

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,433
uh,
you know,

24
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,140
which have enormous amounts of
bandwidth,

25
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,371
uh,
you know,

26
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:03,530
coming into the home,
um,

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,760
uh,
you know,

28
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:08,750
most of that bandwidth is now taken up
with analog programming,

29
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,040
um,
which,

30
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,080
you know,
it doesn't have nearly the efficiency of

31
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:13,370
digital,
but with it,

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,780
you know,
change over to,

33
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,310
to digital,
um,

34
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,270
you know,
that's,

35
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,100
that's going to be going away soon.

36
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,930
Um,
and,

37
00:01:20,931 --> 00:01:22,340
um,
uh,

38
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,870
you know,
people are,

39
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,290
what's happening I think is that people
are beginning to,

40
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,990
to confront the fact that,
you know,

41
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:33,800
when you watch tv it becomes really hard
to find what you want.

42
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,660
Um,
you know,

43
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,970
there,
there might be sure on demand

44
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:39,260
programming,
but you know,

45
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:42,500
even to find the right on demand channel
is not exactly easy.

46
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,030
Um,
you know,

47
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,510
plus,
you know,

48
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,890
there's a very limited availability for,
for what you want.

49
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,350
Um,
and you know,

50
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,320
by contrast you can go online and,
um,

51
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,490
uh,
you know,

52
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,070
easily search for it.
And if it's there,

53
00:01:58,071 --> 00:01:59,000
you can,
uh,

54
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,170
you know,
you can watch it.

55
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,380
And if it's not there on a,
you know,

56
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:05,930
a legit site,
you can find it on a pirate site,

57
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,430
you know,
uh,

58
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,800
in more and more often.
And it's now,

59
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,680
you know,
it's still a relatively small number of

60
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:13,830
people who,
uh,

61
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,420
you know,
have the sort of tech savvy and the

62
00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:18,790
desire to,
to,

63
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,673
to,
you know,

64
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,850
go that route,
but it's not going to be the case for

65
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,684
very long.

66
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,250
Um,
and,

67
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,253
and,
um,

68
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,700
so we're really only one step away from,
uh,

69
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,150
you know,
watching shows on the Internet,

70
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,180
you know,
on your computer to watching them on TV

71
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:40,910
and companies like box the are,
are,

72
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,860
you know,
starting to make that possible,

73
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,061
uh,
you know,

74
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:46,070
starting to make that a plausible
option.

75
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,280
Um,
and when that happens,

76
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,210
uh,
you know,

77
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,690
the whole,
you know,

78
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,190
idea of television as we know it is
going to,

79
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,540
you know,
it's going to change.

80
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,040
Um,
uh,

81
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,190
you know,
people are,

82
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,410
um,
do you think people are paying,

83
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,940
uh,
you know,

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,950
kind of enormous sums,
uh,

85
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:07,940
on a monthly basis for,
you know,

86
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,910
packages of programming.
Much of us,

87
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:13,240
they don't really even want.
And,

88
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:14,950
um,
uh,

89
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,600
you know,
to,

90
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,770
to,
uh,

91
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,780
to,
to be able to,

92
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,840
uh,
you know,

93
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,390
instead,
um,

94
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,640
get anything you do want on a completely
on demand basis and watch it on your,

95
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,370
on your tv set and it's going to be a
very,

96
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,900
very compelling proposition.

97
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,910
Um,
so,

98
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,410
uh,
you know,

99
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:42,610
the problem for the networks and for the
cable companies is that that's not the

100
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:45,070
way the business is structured so far.
You know,

101
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:46,960
the business is structured,
uh,

102
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,510
you know,
around cable companies,

103
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,890
pain,
uh,

104
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,630
you know,
television networks,

105
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,680
uh,
you know,

106
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,150
uh,
cable networks that is,

107
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,710
um,
you know,

108
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,260
large sums per user,
um,

109
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,210
and for,
for the right to carry their

110
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:02,920
programming.
And then,

111
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,701
uh,
you know,

112
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,440
making money by charging the users for,
for,

113
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,560
for,
for the right to see that programming.

114
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,840
Um,
you know,

115
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,290
when you have free online video that you
can watch on your tv set that,

116
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,300
you know,
it kind of does an end run around that

117
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,910
whole set up.
And which is to say,

118
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,400
you know,
it really calls into question the entire

119
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:27,320
economic basis of,
of television that we have right.
