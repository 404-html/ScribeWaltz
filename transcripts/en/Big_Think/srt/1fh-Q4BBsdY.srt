1
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,980
They're begging.
Doc is called after the,

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,373
uh,
Manassian bagans Israeli prime minister 

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,360
order to strike the Iraqi reactor.
Tommaso ciroc back in 1981.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,653
Basically,
the begging doc doctrine says that 

5
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:22,384
Israel would never accept the fact that 
a hostile country that calls for it's 

6
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:28,984
destructions,
destructions holds the means to deliver 

7
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:33,400
this,
this sort of operation,

8
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:34,234
meaning Israel would never tolerate the 
existent of nuclear power in the hands 

9
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,500
of,
of a hostile country like Syria or Iran.

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,510
And you can draw your conclusions from 
that.

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,290
That if worst comes to worst as a very 
last resort,

12
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:51,460
if Israel is convinced that the 
International Boyko doesn't work,

13
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,580
that Russia and China do not align with 
the rest of the world,

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,713
that economic sanctions do not pressure 
Iran enough that the United States is 

15
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,184
not going to take action and Iran is 
getting too close to close to enable 

16
00:01:04,091 --> 00:01:07,390
them.
Israel with strike Iran.

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,930
And I can tell you that long,
not long ago,

18
00:01:10,931 --> 00:01:11,950
a few weeks ago in,
uh,

19
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,390
in,
uh,

20
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,550
classify discussion dealing with the 
Iranian issue,

21
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:18,430
there's a special form of the Israeli 
decision and intelligence,

22
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,590
uh,
operatives dealing with Iran.

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,690
One of them said that if worse comes to 
worse,

24
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,583
we must bear in mind what the Israeli 
first Prime Minister David been going 

25
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:30,943
and said repeatedly that we did not 
bring the survivors of the Holocaust to 

26
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:39,460
Israel to suffer another,
another holocaust,

27
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,790
and we would do everything but 
everything to prevent them.

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,740
[inaudible].
