1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,090
Well actually surveys I have seen
indicate about 40% of scientists believe

2
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:13,671
in a god to whom one may pray an
expectation of an answer that's not a

3
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:15,290
god,
uh,

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,020
who went off after con creating the
universe and did something else.

5
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:20,850
That's a god who's interested in human
beings.

6
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:22,520
40%,
uh,

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,610
would adhere to that statement.
The numbers are smaller when you ask

8
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:30,060
members of the National Academy of
Sciences and just various reasons people

9
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:34,830
have proposed why so called elite
scientists have an even lower proportion

10
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:36,570
of believers.
Uh,

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,600
but it's not as devastatingly absent
from the scientific community as people

12
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:46,830
might assume based on the fact that the
pronouncements they hear coming from

13
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:51,831
scientists are usually more in the
skeptical or even atheistic perspective.

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,450
I think whether or not a scientists are
believers,

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,880
uh,
should not have a whole lot to do with

16
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:04,110
how they conduct science.
The fact that I am a believer as far as

17
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:08,160
I'm aware of has had very little
influence on my scientific work.

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,580
And I think that's important to keep
that distinction.

19
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,450
If I'm asking a scientific question,
it's the tools of science I should be

20
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,760
using.
And not assuming that something

21
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:20,880
supernatural happened in the test tube
at that moment.

22
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:25,881
And that would explain my data point a.
So I do think people of faith and people

23
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:29,820
who don't have faith are capable of
thoughtful,

24
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,440
ethical decision making.
So any notion that we are becoming less

25
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:38,070
ethical as scientists because of a
diminution and religious faith,

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,400
I think has to be actually countered by
a arguments to say that as sense of

27
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:47,250
ethical behavior is not a distributed,
uh,

28
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,970
to just to people who are in fact
interest in spiritual matters.

29
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,220
Um,
so I'm not sure,

30
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:56,970
I think it would diminish the
hostilities which are bad for our

31
00:01:56,971 --> 00:02:01,971
culture if more scientists were in fact
willing to stand up and say that faith

32
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:05,700
and science need not to be in conflict.

33
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,390
Because right now that's a minority view
that doesn't get heard very much.

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,650
And it's apparent to some people that
were having more of a cultural war,

35
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,760
a war that seems to imply that some
worldview needs to win and some

36
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:22,530
worldview needs to lose.
I would not want to look forward to a

37
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:27,531
culture where science lost and religious
faith became the dominating force.

38
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:30,480
For Truth.
I would not want to live in a culture

39
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,490
where faith lost and science with all of
its reductionism and it's materialism

40
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:39,000
became the sole source of truth.
I think we need both kinds of truth.

41
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:43,440
We need both kinds of world views.
To the extent that scientists can help

42
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,840
with that realization of the duel,
uh,

43
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,480
ways of finding answers to the
appropriate kind of questions that each

44
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:54,030
worldview can ask,
then I think that would be a good thing.

45
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,540
Certainly sociobiologists,
uh,

46
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,440
have put forward arguments that religion
could have an evolutionary basis that we

47
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:10,441
humans are designed in a certain way to
look for agency behind actions that we

48
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:15,400
don't understand and that may then
relate to a why various cultures.

49
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:20,401
Over time I have identified something
mysterious and supernatural outside of

50
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:25,840
their own experience to try to explain
things that didn't otherwise have an

51
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:29,500
explanation.
I think it's too simple a to basically

52
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,700
say,
well that does it.

53
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,510
Either.
God is true.

54
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:34,600
Our God is not true either.
God is real.

55
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:38,020
Our God is not real.
It's not a matter of whether you can

56
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:41,890
explain it away by a hypothesis.
The question is what's the real answer?

57
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,000
And I think far too few people have kind
of looked at the question from that

58
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,550
perspective.
What's the evidence for the idea that

59
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:52,450
God exists or doesn't exist?
I think anyone who's looked at that

60
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,440
would conclude that the strong atheist
position of saying,

61
00:03:56,441 --> 00:04:00,700
I know there is no god,
is not an easy one to sustain.

62
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,653
Uh,
it,

63
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,920
it basically implies a certain degree of
Hubris and arrogance to say that I know

64
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:10,060
so much that I could exclude any
possibility of there being a god.

65
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,850
On the other hand,
the evidence will never draw people to

66
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:15,700
the conclusion of saying,
I know confidently there is a god.

67
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,140
Maybe God didn't intend it to be that
easy.
