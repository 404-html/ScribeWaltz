1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,463
No,

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:07,470
I am Fred Wilson and I am the managing
partner of Union square ventures.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,240
It's been changing the way I work for
the past 15 years.

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,290
I see it as an,
as an evolution,

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,450
not really a revolution.
So,

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,130
uh,
I think every year there are two or

7
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:32,131
three new things that I use as part of
my daily life that I wasn't using the

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
year before.
Um,

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,220
and uh,
you know,

10
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:41,221
I think social media,
whether it be blogging or I'm a social

11
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:48,370
networking or things at the intersection
of blogging and social networking,

12
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:52,360
like twittering and so on and so forth,
these are becoming incredibly more

13
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:56,590
valuable to me as business tools.
And they were two or three years ago,

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,870
uh,
I've used the phone less and less

15
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:01,360
everyday.
I used to say that when I got into the

16
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,920
business,
uh,

17
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,840
in the mid eighties,
the phone was the way that I did 80

18
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:12,841
percent of my work by the mid nineties,
email had become the dominant form of

19
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:17,710
the way I did most of my work.
And the phone had gone down

20
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,030
substantially.

21
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,270
Now social media and blogging and
twittering and things like that have,

22
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,980
have,
have become the highest form of the way

23
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:31,060
I do my work.
Email has come down relatively speaking

24
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,090
in value and the phone is almost
completely gone from the tool set that I

25
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:40,960
use to get stuff done now.
Face to face interaction has been a

26
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:42,670
constant.
So,

27
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,380
um,
I see,

28
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,020
I don't think that has changed one bit,
you know,

29
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:50,170
going to a board meeting or having a
face to face meeting with an

30
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:51,360
entrepreneur,
um,

31
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,420
in order to decide whether we want to
make an investment is as valuable or

32
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:58,150
more valuable today than it was 20 or 30
years ago.

33
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,640
Um,
so that hasn't lost any value,

34
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:03,880
but the phone has come way,
way down and now I see email coming down

35
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:04,714
a lot too.

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,020
I think that several things going on,

37
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,700
I think that,
uh,

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,270
the,
that this generation is going to be a,

39
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,700
a very different kind of workforce and
the workforce that businesses have known

40
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,260
in the past,
I think they will be a lot less loyal to

41
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,990
businesses.
They will be.

42
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,020
I'm interested in maximizing the value
of their career as opposed to the value

43
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,410
of the stock of the company that they're
working for it,

44
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,750
unless they control that stock or own a
big piece of it.

45
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,810
So I think that the,
we're looking at,

46
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,970
I'm very much immersed,
mercenary,

47
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,200
mercenary workforce.
Uh,

48
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,600
we've already seen that in the
technology business for the past 10

49
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:56,610
years,
particularly among software developers

50
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,020
in Silicon Valley.
You know,

51
00:02:58,021 --> 00:02:59,100
there's,
there's,

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,450
you know,
the best software engineers are

53
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:04,360
constantly getting poached from company
to company company and getting better

54
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:07,690
and better deals along the way in the
same way that a,

55
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:12,691
I'm a film star or a music recording
star would be constantly being offered a

56
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:16,450
better and better contract to go work
for somebody new.

57
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,800
Same thing's happening with software
engineers and I think that that kind of

58
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:25,801
mindset about talent is what this
younger generation's all about.

59
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:29,650
And so they're all going to be about
building their own personal brand and

60
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:33,070
their own personal career,
their own personal portfolio of what

61
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:36,010
they can do.
And then they can make themselves

62
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:38,350
available to the market,
to the highest bidder.

63
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,630
Well,
so for us,

64
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,120
the biggest impact and in the companies
that we've backed is that,

65
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,700
uh,
we can hire somebody,

66
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,310
um,
who is the best person for the job,

67
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,280
uh,
if they are not necessarily willing to

68
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:57,440
locate.
I'm taking here in New York City.

69
00:03:57,441 --> 00:04:02,270
So we have companies in New York City
that have a software engineers all over

70
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:04,400
the world.
We have people in New York City that

71
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:09,401
have product managers or whole customer
services organizations in another

72
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:10,850
location.
Um,

73
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,520
you can put
your,

74
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:18,610
your high labor cost workforce somewhere
else than where your headquarters is and

75
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:20,571
uh,
and,

76
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:21,660
and make it work.
I mean,

77
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,840
and this has obviously been going on for
a long time,

78
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,650
but this is a trend that will continue,
uh,

79
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,800
for,
for all forever probably,

80
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,010
uh,
I have been profoundly affected by this.

81
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:44,011
I write a web log that is read by about
100,000 people a month.

82
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,580
And,
uh,

83
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,920
within that group I'd say there's
probably about 20,000 people who are

84
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:54,100
sort of the most hardcore,
you know,

85
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:56,680
committed participants in that
community.

86
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:59,200
And I really mean community.
These people do meet ups,

87
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,100
they comment on my blog,
they have offline conversations with

88
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:04,450
each other,
they meet each other,

89
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,530
they go and do startups together,
says this community that exists,

90
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,570
I consider probably at least a thousand
of these people friends,

91
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,630
and yet I have met um,
and advisors,

92
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,341
right?
Um,

93
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:20,640
and I've maybe met 100 or 200 of them,
um,

94
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,740
but I'll get emails from people who I've
been communicating with and dialoguing

95
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:28,840
with for three or four years saying,
you know,

96
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,820
you need to go visit this company.
I saw what they were doing yesterday and

97
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:36,570
it's,
it's absolutely revolutionary and,

98
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,290
and I'll go do it even though I've never
met this person because I,

99
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,320
I know who they are.

100
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,810
I've been able to develop a relationship
with them online.

101
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:47,830
I've had conversations with them and
discussions and debates and uh,

102
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,930
and that's brand new that has never
existed in the world of business.

103
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,710
And we are leveraging that in our
business.

104
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,140
And I think that lots of people are
leveraging it in all different kinds of

105
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:03,770
businesses.
Businesses are starting to engage with

106
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:08,180
their customers using these tools in
ways that they've never done before and

107
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:11,840
they're starting to get feedback from
their customers in terms of what's

108
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:14,810
working and what's not working,
what products are good and what products

109
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:17,390
are not good,
what people in their organizations are

110
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:19,370
good and what people in organizations
are not good.

111
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,460
And um,
and people are starting to develop a

112
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:27,461
level of trust around this kind of blind
or anonymous or semi anonymous kind of

113
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:31,670
communication that they didn't trust
five or 10 years ago because it was so

114
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:33,170
new.
But now people are seeing,

115
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:35,210
yeah,
I can trust that kind of feedback even

116
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:37,820
though I'm not getting it in,
in a traditional way.

117
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,680
So it's been going on.
Last time programmers have been using

118
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:48,500
something called IRC,
which is Internet relay chat.

119
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,750
Um,
and they're these sort of form your own

120
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:54,020
chat rooms.
And so what programming teams have done

121
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:58,790
for the better part of 10 or 15,
maybe 20 years is they all come in in

122
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:02,210
the morning and one person's in,
you know,

123
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,880
Vancouver,
Canada and one person's in New York

124
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,950
City.
And one person's in,

125
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,960
in Buenos Aires and another person's in
Bangalore,

126
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:13,250
they all come into this IRC chat room
and they're writing code and talking to

127
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:14,720
each other at the same time.
And they're saying,

128
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,970
yeah,
how do I hit this database?

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,660
What,
what's the,

130
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,900
what's the query I need to use?
And the person who has the database guy

131
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:21,621
in Bangladesh has,
oh,

132
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:24,950
you write this query this way.
So they're collaborating using these

133
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:27,320
online tools.
So that's been going on for a long time

134
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,350
now for um,
you know,

135
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,360
a marketing organization that's not as
Geeky,

136
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,860
you know,
that's not a,

137
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,250
that's not a,
a good way for them to work,

138
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,490
but they can use a Wiki,
which is basically a website that exists

139
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,400
inside the firewall and outside the
firewall they can post questions to it

140
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,020
that's happening.

141
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,070
Um,
and there are,

142
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,810
uh,
there are even companies that are using

143
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:54,530
facebook groups I'm in,
which is kind of a public group,

144
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:57,230
but people are using that even for
businesses.

145
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,060
So there are a hundreds,
if not thousands of different tools that

146
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:04,820
exists for businesses to do these kinds
of things.

147
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,800
And um,
more,

148
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,180
more being developed every day.
