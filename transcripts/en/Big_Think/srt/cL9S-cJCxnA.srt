1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,400
You asked me if I knew the person's
looking for truth.

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,610
You see,
as a scientist,

3
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:11,940
we're even today like that.
Earlier I talked about the fact that all

4
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:15,840
we can do in science is construct
theories and that means,

5
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,870
for example,
that what we're ultimately doing is not

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,400
about the truth.
This is a confusion I think that exists

7
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:25,260
in many people's minds.
Science is not about finding the truth.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,040
What scientists about is making our
beliefs of nature less false.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,460
These are two different things,
and the second one involves mathematics,

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,820
imagination,
and the ability to measure.

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,500
So we're making our beliefs less false.
We're not necessarily finding it through

12
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,030
the fact,
I'm not sure.

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,140
Truth actually exists in science and
this is in fact a very famous statement

14
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:53,520
that Einstein made that he is not sure
what truth means in the context of

15
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:54,990
science.
So No,

16
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:56,190
I'm not searching for truth.

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,190
That's certainly not what I'm doing.
Sometimes when I look at my own career,

18
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:06,120
I feel a little bit like Captain Ahab
and I think probably a lot of us feel

19
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:08,520
that way,
that this is a great white whale that we

20
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:12,270
saw once and we're trying to capture it
in my own life.

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,400
Um,
I earlier spoke of this

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,510
interdisciplinary collaboration of
mathematicians and physicists and

23
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,760
computer scientists.
We're,

24
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,570
we're,
uh,

25
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,570
on the p Quad chasing my white whale.
There's this one problem that I know

26
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:30,000
about that I,
I've been able to develop some

27
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:35,001
particular insights into.
And this collaboration is actually

28
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:38,640
pursuing this problem.
We've been able to turn sets of

29
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:43,260
equations that the sorts of pictures and
these pictures can be processed.

30
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,030
And by manipulating the pictures,
you're massively using them to

31
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:52,650
understand properties are the equations
I call these pictures of Dinka and

32
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,760
thinkers.
A very interesting word.

33
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:57,210
It comes from west Africa and it
basically means pictures that have

34
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:59,550
hidden meaning.
And so that's what we've applied to

35
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:02,100
these mathematical objects.
And so yes,

36
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:04,440
I have my own personal moby Dick that
I'm after.

37
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,430
However,
I don't plan to suffer the fate of the

38
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:08,850
peak wise and it's capital.

39
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,760
No
theoretical.

40
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:20,770
Physics doesn't really make that kind of
company contribution to our

41
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:22,630
understanding.
In fact,

42
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,650
one of the another thing I tell people
about what science is versus other forms

43
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:34,441
of knowing the universe in science and
in particular in the physical sciences,

44
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,690
you can imagine a family that lives in a
home and you could say,

45
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:42,190
well Gee,
I want to study this situation,

46
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:44,710
but I want to put all the people out of
the house.

47
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,120
I wanted to study how the house works.
That's what the physical sciences do in

48
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:51,950
our universe.
The social sciences,

49
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,550
the liberal arts,
the arts themselves.

50
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,660
You'll put the people back in the house
and you asked how the whole system works

51
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:00,400
together.
So in physics,

52
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:04,440
we don't answer the question of how the
house behaves when the families in the

53
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,400
past.
