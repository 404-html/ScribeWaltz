1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,050
Putting issues on the cable

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,330
so that we have to understand the
cultural mindset.

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,300
However,
there's far more in common.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,440
Then there is indifference.
So in Asia,

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,630
in Japan,
other parts of Asia,

6
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:24,631
for example,
saving face is fundamentally a process.

7
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:28,690
You simply don't rip the face off of
another person.

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,920
You don't also open so much yourself in
the beginning because you don't want to

9
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:37,000
lose face yourself.
So it takes longer to build those bonds.

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,340
And if you're the same way in the Middle
East,

11
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:43,570
if you go to the Middle East,
you cannot go to was sued and buy

12
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,120
something without sitting inhabiting a
tea.

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,090
If it's a significant purchase in the
west,

14
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:52,900
we tend to be more direct.
What's your bottom line?

15
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,070
You go right to it,
which,

16
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:55,650
which are fundamental mistake.
