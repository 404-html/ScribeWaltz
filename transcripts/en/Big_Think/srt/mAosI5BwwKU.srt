Support for big thing comes from
Microsoft delivering people ready

enterprise solutions designed to help
companies do more with less details at

3
00:00:15,131 --> 00:00:17,500
Microsoft.com/people ready.

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,900
I'm Tom Stemberg.
I'm the managing general partner of the

5
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:29,901
highland consumer funds.
Without question.

6
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,210
A lot of entrepreneurial ideas come out
of challenging times.

7
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,660
I always say that entrepreneurs are
folks who turned adversity into

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,300
opportunity.
A good example of that is right now in

9
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:51,810
the retail space,
and I tend to vest in the retail space,

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,430
you can finally afford to open units in
Manhattan.

11
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,770
Again,
over the past decade,

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,800
rents were so absurd that unless you had
ridiculous price points at obscene gross

13
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,680
margins,
you couldn't possibly afford to pay the

14
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:08,910
rent.
Well,

15
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,690
that's changed very dramatically over
the last 12 months.

16
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,910
And that's unbalanced.
I think a good thing.

17
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,490
Uh,
and we will see lots of great ideas

18
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,750
spawned out of this downturn.
Engineers who get laid off from big

19
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:25,680
companies are going to start new
companies and those kinds of companies

20
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:28,560
are going to change things going into
the future.

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,721
A,
B,

22
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:34,080
they in communications between energy
and be they in lots of other areas.

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,001
Uh,
first of all,

24
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:43,001
obviously those entities which are
positioned as value brands will do

25
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:49,050
better than those who are perceived as
high price or,

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,610
or having frills to them.
So to be clear you want to be there,

27
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,410
but having said that,
what you don't want to do is begin to

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,700
move away from your fundamental brand
position,

29
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,510
just kind of as a temporary fix during a
downtime.

30
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:10,511
So what we've seen lots of people do a
is during these times say,

31
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:11,414
well,
you know,

32
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm brand x and would I create something
called kind of brand x and where they

33
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:23,021
used to sell brand decks to full price
retailers and now so it kind of brand x

34
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,980
to Walmart and Costco.
And then what happens is the full price

35
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,310
full service retail say I'm not going to
do business with these guys anymore.

36
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,180
And next thing you know,
they basically destroyed their entire

37
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:37,700
brand equity.
And that's happened too often.

38
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,230
So you got to be very careful and
sticking to what your brand stands for

39
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:43,064
in the consumer's mind.

40
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,740
Well,
the generic brands were an outgrowth of

41
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:54,741
the Jimmy Carter stagflation years where
the economy was declining.

42
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:57,180
And we combine that with a high double
digit,

43
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:59,530
almost 20 percent interest rates.
Uh,

44
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,460
fortunately we don't face that today,
uh,

45
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,940
the but inflation was running rampant
and I got to be very clear with you that

46
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:10,870
I did not invent generic brands.
I copied them if company in France

47
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:15,871
called cuff for a,
had created something called Lipo which

48
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:19,360
were so called free products,
free from advertising free from

49
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:21,280
expensive marketing,
just the fundamentalist.

50
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,420
Uh,
my boss at jewel,

51
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:27,130
a gentleman named Don Perkins,
saw this in Europe and brought it back

52
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:28,360
to his company is say,
guys,

53
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:31,210
you got to try this.
And some of the,

54
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,840
the divisions and the bigger divisions
didn't want to run with the idea because

55
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,750
they were worried it would cannibalize
their private label at lower margins,

56
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,593
etc.

57
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,960
I was the head of marketing at star
market in boston where we had a very

58
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:46,510
high quality of but a high price
reputation.

59
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,120
I said,
this is a big idea that if we

60
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,360
entrepreneurially move forward to this,
we could change our price perception

61
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:53,610
overnight.
A,

62
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,110
therefore we copied it,
that we rebranded it.

63
00:03:56,111 --> 00:04:00,040
No name brands.
[inaudible] a great low cost restaurant

64
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:03,820
in boston called the no name and we
figured we live off that we call the no

65
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:07,240
name brands and uh,
it turned out to be an overnight success

66
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:09,270
and we didn't have to advertise it
because we,

67
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,580
all the news media climbing all over it
and the prices are so dramatically low

68
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:17,581
what it took care of itself and was a
very interesting venture that overtime

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,080
kind of,
you know.

70
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,100
Uh,
so it's time come and go.

71
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,010
Well,
I think there's a couple things that I'd

72
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:31,060
say as I reflect back on my staples
career and gosh,

73
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:34,360
there's lots of things I'm incredibly
proud of having done,

74
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,570
including giving us a leadership
position on the internet.

75
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,080
One I'm less proud of is how we approach
international because frankly we

76
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:45,950
approached international too soon.
Uh,

77
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,390
Canada was,
was worked out well and that was early

78
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:51,180
in.
It's close enough.

79
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,640
That worked out great.
If you go through the historical profit

80
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:55,810
and loss statements,
not today,

81
00:04:55,811 --> 00:05:00,190
But how they used to be a 10 years ago
or so in 15 years ago in Germany and

82
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:02,380
england,
and is not a pretty picture.

83
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,020
It's extremely hard to take any kind of
people intensive business from the

84
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:13,501
United States over to europe and you
know,

85
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,530
for all our economic problems,
I'd argue there's are worse than ours.

86
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,210
I mean with their pension obligations
and the union structures.

87
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,110
I think actually they have more problems
than we do and we got plenty of problems

88
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,440
so that the notion you somehow another
find growth and prosperity in europe and

89
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:35,170
it's easy or that england is easy
because they speak the same language.

90
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,560
It is just not true.
And uh,

91
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,790
I had a colleague at staples named joe
vessel.

92
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,090
So what a,
what a great line.

93
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,020
He quoted churchill and saying in
england and the us were two countries

94
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:51,970
divided by a common language in the
example and england when they were

95
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:54,610
forced to turnover,
that means revenues is a good thing.

96
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,080
We talked about turnover here in the
states.

97
00:05:56,081 --> 00:06:00,910
It's a bad thing.
I think that indian China harbor nola as

98
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,460
difficulties from an expansion for
interview than england,

99
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:06,380
Germany arguably they're even more
difficult.

100
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,950
Having said that,
the good news about england,

101
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,430
about China and India is you've got
explosive growth and growth covers on

102
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,320
awful lot of sins.

103
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,440
So even with the chinese growth
moderating,

104
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,530
it's moderating to still be amongst the
fastest,

105
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:27,140
if not the fastest growing economy in
the world.

106
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,050
Uh,
we had terrific success there with

107
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:34,130
staples were invested in the business
that's now grown to be a several hundred

108
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:34,963
million dollar business.
And uh,

109
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,880
I've got lots of friends over there and
uh,

110
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,340
uh,
so I still see tremendous opportunities

111
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:43,280
there,
particularly in the consumer segment and

112
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:46,010
in retailing.
We see lots of opportunities in China,

113
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,930
India,
uh,

114
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,530
I would characterize it similarly.
So having said that,

115
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:52,820
the,
uh,

116
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,300
if you're a software business,
it's probably easier if you're in the

117
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:59,870
retail business.
The challenge of dIstribution over there

118
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:02,150
and the fact there's not really road
patterns over there.

119
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,400
Uh,
I think it makes it very,

120
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:05,234
very challenging.

121
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,270
I think the first thing I would advise
any chief executive entering these

122
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:17,210
times,
and I think interestingly in this time

123
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:18,980
around,
you didn't have to advise the ceos,

124
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,130
the good ones.
People like Christine Day,

125
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:27,131
a little lemon or tommy folio at carmax
or fill francis at petsmart,

126
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,330
didn't have to be told.
They on their own realized that they had

127
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,250
to prepare their companies for what
could be a calamitous situation.

128
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,150
You just didn't know how bad it was
going to get and in virtually every case

129
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,960
they planned for scenarios that turned
out to be far worse than at least we've

130
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:49,460
seen to date.
Having done that in first and foremost

131
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,040
have insured survival.
That's your first job.

132
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,760
Once you've gotten to that point and now
you see sort of the dust settle and I'm

133
00:07:57,861 --> 00:07:59,840
an optimist,
so I think that does more or less has

134
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:03,420
settled.
Then you now have to become

135
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,890
opportunistic very quickly and you
almost have to turn it a hundred and 80

136
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:11,810
degrees and I see these companies now
are poisoned themselves to grow.

137
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:16,430
But Christine Day was in New York half
of lulu lemon about a week ago and

138
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,160
that's very,
very exciting company and she came in

139
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:21,290
and basically said to the landlords
know,

140
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,230
gentlemen,
if you follow the following guidelines

141
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:29,231
we have for a new leases going forward,
we're now prepared to look at

142
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,790
opportunities.
But if you still have some of these

143
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,020
crazy red ideas that came about,
uh,

144
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,930
uh,
at the beginning of the century,

145
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:39,320
at the end of the last one,
just hold onto your property and we'll,

146
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,170
we'll,
we'll just walk by those for lease

147
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:42,004
signs.
