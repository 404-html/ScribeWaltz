1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,660
That's a very interesting question.
I don't think that one can say as a

2
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:15,450
blanket statement that America,
I'm an American.

3
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:17,740
I think there are parallels in both.
Um,

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,570
there are,
there are parallels in too much trust in

5
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:26,550
government and I think you saw that to
some degree in the 19 sixties with

6
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:30,120
America's legacy in entry intervention
to Vietnam and even to I think to a

7
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:32,880
slightly lesser degree,
you saw that with the wake of Iraq after

8
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:36,390
a period after nine slash 11 when
Americans were more trusting of their

9
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:39,560
leaders and wanting to believe and then
follow their leaders.

10
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,423
Um,
uh,

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,380
so they're excessive trust can be
dangerous,

12
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:48,381
particularly when it leads to the
congress and the judiciary and the press

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,790
being complacent,
uh,

14
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,090
in their,
in their acceptance of the official

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,490
version of events.
I'm,

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,510
on the other hand,
I'm too radical a distrust,

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,120
um,
can prevent government from being able

18
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:08,121
to function a effectively that,
that public leaders publicly,

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,840
you want public leaders to earn people's
trust by being honest with them,

20
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:15,090
by being effective in what they do.

21
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,630
Because unless the government is a
government is able to earn some degree

22
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:21,570
of public trust,
it is not able to bring Americans along

23
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,840
the hard decision.
So it was very important in Franklin

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,620
Roosevelt taking American to World War
Two that he was able to bring to develop

25
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,910
the trust of the American people.
Um,

26
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,000
obviously Pearl Harbor made,
made a,

27
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,940
made a big difference in our entrance,
in the world of throughput that the

28
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,820
Franklin Roosevelt was very shrewd about
recognizing the degree that he had to

29
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:41,940
build trust in the American amongst the
American people,

30
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:44,400
and a mix even amongst people of the
opposing party,

31
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:49,080
which is why he systematically brought
Republicans and political opponents in

32
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,730
to work with him on foreign policy in
order that he could maintain the trust

33
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,100
to bring Americans to do something which
was very difficult.

34
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:59,190
Which to send our troops again into a
European war.
