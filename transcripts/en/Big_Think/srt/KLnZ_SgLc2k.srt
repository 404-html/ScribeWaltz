1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,380
Let me start a different place first and
then come through exactly what you want.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,630
Um,
I was born in 1933 is that Adolf Hitler

3
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:16,620
was being elected,
the chancellor of Germany and some of my

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,770
earliest images is that young lad in the
movie theaters in the 19 forties was

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,280
really the opening of the concentration
camps by allied troops.

6
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:29,310
And then more and more as the weeks went
on,

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,940
film became available and we could say
these bodies being heaved like sacks of

8
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,280
earth or something like that up on the
trucks,

9
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,300
off the trucks.
And,

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,733
and,
um,

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,460
uh,
I,

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,310
that frightened me a bit when I was
young,

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,180
but it also impressed me that he had a
life could be a lot more meaningless

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,610
than we think it is.
A not nearly so comfortable.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,640
Who of those people thought a year
before that they would be so treated?

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,110
I'm 100 million people in Europe alone.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,260
I lost their lives by violence in the
20th century.

18
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:10,090
So when I read Haig only said history is
a butcher's bench chair.

19
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,260
Sure sounded true to me.
So,

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,670
um,
I'm,

21
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:15,900
you know,
I,

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,380
this,
this sort of sense of the possibility of

23
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:22,100
darkness and chaos and meaninglessness
and a

24
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,020
cruelty and barbarity at the heart of
things that seemed always to be alive in

25
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:28,900
my conscience.
Uh,

26
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:30,570
you know,
I don't remember a time when it,

27
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,970
when it hasn't been there.
Um,

28
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,840
and then I studied for a long time to
become a priest and I,

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,830
you know,
spent more than a decade in a monastery

30
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:44,370
is too strong a word because it's a more
modern now the order of the holy cross

31
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,500
fathers,
little bit like the Jesuit,

32
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,840
they teach it,
he run Notre Dame and Stone Hill

33
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,100
College,
my alma mater and so forth.

34
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,910
But we used to pray,
we admitted our regular schedule,

35
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,860
regular hours of the day,
a long day.

36
00:01:58,861 --> 00:01:59,694
But,
um,

37
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,190
we,
we hit about four hours or more set

38
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:04,830
aside for prayer,
much of it together,

39
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,820
much of it private.
I'm alone.

40
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:11,600
And,
and there are often days and weeks where

41
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,280
I just didn't have any feeling for God
at all.

42
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,900
When you,
when I,

43
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,823
you know,
I,

44
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,590
I did so much doubt.
But nonetheless,

45
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:22,950
I did wonder sometimes whether all this
is a fraud or a,

46
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,280
you know,
am I kidding myself or deceiving myself,

47
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,690
but I learned that,
that this is a pretty common theme and,

48
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,600
and you should be,
you should be glad that these adult

49
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:40,980
moments and they're learn too
well.

50
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:45,981
What do you do?
I love the text of St John's letter m

51
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,780
where he says,
how do you know that you love God and

52
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,040
either you wouldn't be in a seminary or
a kind of,

53
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,790
and if you didn't think you love God,
but how do you know?

54
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,880
Um,
it's not enough just to say that.

55
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,410
And he said by this,
do you know if you love God,

56
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,010
if you have love for one another.
And so the moments of darkness ought to

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
lead you to be more kind and receptive
to others,

58
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,800
especially the ones that get on your
nerves.

59
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,750
Uh,
especially the ones that are hard to

60
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:28,480
deal with the gods in them too.
After all.

61
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,510
And,
and I say that just as a way of

62
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,540
negotiating the darkness.
It's not that you suddenly feel lighter

63
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:39,310
constellation,
but this seems like the North Star,

64
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:43,570
this seems like the right,
the True Path and some favorite saints

65
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:46,840
in mind.
Carmelites mostly not mother Theresa,

66
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:49,060
but St Theresa of Louisiana's and Teresa
of Avila,

67
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,730
um,
live through this darkness were

68
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:56,770
marvelous books about it and
guidebooks homeless if you want.

69
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,390
And I think they're onto something real
and deep and into,

70
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,980
and the Inter religious,
you know,

71
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:07,210
you find in every religion you find the
deepest people understand this very well

72
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,660
and can talk about it very well.
The more shallow people makes them

73
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:17,290
nervous,
but I religion that intends to be

74
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,020
universal.
It is meant to be universal as in

75
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:22,480
different ways that Judaism and
Christianity or,

76
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,920
um,
has got to be a shallow enough for ants

77
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,120
to wade through and deep enough to drown
giraffes,

78
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:35,590
if you know what I mean.
It's gotTa have room for all types.
