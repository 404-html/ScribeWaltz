1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,430
Okay,

2
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,391
you know,
it's like,

3
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:15,780
um,
we're living in the,

4
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:19,230
in the first days of,
of mass self organization.

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:20,980
Um,
you know,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,480
clay shirky likes to say this is as big
a change is the admission of the

7
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:29,481
printing press was 500 years ago.
We now have ridiculously easy tools for

8
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:35,361
organizing ourselves.
And so the political impact is huge.

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:36,893
The,
the,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,020
the presidential election just is like a
huge training ground.

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,190
So there were thousands of thousands of
people who have just gone through an

12
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:49,191
experience of effectively discovering
how good they can be as organizers,

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,970
right?
They've learned how to a survey,

14
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:58,830
their own local political landscape and
figure out how to deliver the votes that

15
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:02,400
were needed for the larger cause.
In this case of electing Obama,

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,880
many of these people aren't going to,
they're not going back to what they were

17
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:09,600
before this,
you know,

18
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:14,601
the Obama campaign surveyed a,
their supporters after the election,

19
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,010
they got about half a million actually
filled out a detailed survey and 10

20
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:25,440
percent,
50,000 people said they're interested in

21
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:29,160
running for office,
which means a whole new wave of,

22
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,480
of energy entering the political process
at every level.

23
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,450
And whenever that happens,
um,

24
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,360
you're,
you're bound to have a change in as well

25
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,660
in what the incumbents do and as these
people get elected and then rise and,

26
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:47,310
you know,
start running for higher office,

27
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,610
it has a larger societal effect.
So I think,

28
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,610
you know,
you might call this the Obamas coattails

29
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,800
and he is just the beginning of that
much bigger wave that's going to spread

30
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:03,801
through American society.
Assuming that we don't have a political

31
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:05,490
disaster.
I mean,

32
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:08,470
I'm assuming he,
he lives up to the promises that.
