1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,390
Religion plays a very significant role
because

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,730
what is most important to me about
religion is I think it is the only

3
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:22,731
secure basis for ethical and moral
behavior and I think that as religion

4
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:26,730
decay is ethics and morality,
the k dramatically,

5
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,450
and I think that often happens in
history with material prosperity in,

6
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,200
with lack of danger of generally
speaking.

7
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:42,201
And I think that's happening again.
So I look to not too doctrinaire

8
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:45,504
religion.
I'm not,

9
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,010
I'm not religious in a doctrinaire
fashion.

10
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,070
Uh,
and the protestantism in the Christian

11
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:58,071
church gave us that.
So I read the Bible and the religious

12
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:02,760
classics and I think of what they mean
to me and what I think they should mean

13
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:07,761
to other people.
And it plays a huge role in my life in

14
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:08,730
that regard.
