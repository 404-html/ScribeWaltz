1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,270
I can ask you about the question up in
quite a lot and the question is,

2
00:00:11,271 --> 00:00:13,370
will we have a limited amount of oil?
Well,

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,930
yes,
we do have limited amount of oil.

4
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:19,210
We have a limited amount of television
cameras and a Rolex watches and uh,

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,170
light bulbs and you name it.
There's a,

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,440
there's a finite number of everything.
My response to the peak oil,

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,160
uh,
arguments are,

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,300
okay,
so what,

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,970
yes,
we're going to hit a peak oil production

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,760
at some point in the future when that
is,

11
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:37,940
no one can predict.
But the point is that as the price of

12
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:40,010
oil rises,
entrepreneurs,

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,850
innovators are going to come up with new
ways to find oil and get it out of the

14
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:46,980
ground and further that the issue as
that,

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,210
as that price rises,
demand has to stay in balance with

16
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:52,400
supply.
You can't have more demand than supply

17
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,210
the price.

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,970
Eventually we'll,
we'll crush demand at a certain point

19
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,010
and they will,
they will stay in balance.

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,610
The good news for the u s which I think
is,

21
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,680
people may not say it's good news,
but we can afford higher oil prices more

22
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:10,130
easily than can't say Pakistan or India.
We are,

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,950
we're wealthier country.
We have more disposable income.

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,820
Um,
and so we are going to see as,

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,720
as oil or natural gas or any commodity
becomes more expensive.

26
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,050
Rolex watches,
they are rationed by price.

27
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,090
And in fact,
we have rationing by price.

28
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:30,380
Today on virtually every commodity.
Not everyone can eat at 21 club.

29
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,260
Not everyone wears a rolex.
Everything is rationed by price.

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,310
As energy prices rise,
we will see more pronounced rationing by

31
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:38,870
price of energy,
commodities.

32
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,470
And I think that that's inevitable.
The good news is that as the price

33
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:44,180
rises,
we'll see more innovation and more

34
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:46,640
alternatives come into the market,
whatever that may be,

35
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:49,240
whether it's batteries in cars or,
uh,

36
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,350
you know,
some other liquid fuel,

37
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,310
uh,
not ethanol,

38
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,110
uh,
that may come into the market.

39
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:00,770
Okay.
