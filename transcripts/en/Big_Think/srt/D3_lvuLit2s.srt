1
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,310
I was born in Russia and came over when
I was very little.

2
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:16,150
I was six and a,
I grew up outside of Boston.

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,360
My parents,
first they lived in Brighton,

4
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,740
which is where the Russians start out.
And then they gradually moved west.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,670
They moved to Brookline and then they
moved to Newton and that's where they

6
00:00:27,671 --> 00:00:30,010
stopped.
And now some people,

7
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:34,490
they move out to Lincoln and conquered,
um,

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,390
where they're not very many Russians at
all.

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,900
But in,
uh,

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,800
in Newton,
there are a few Russians.

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,860
So I'm partly from Moscow and I'm partly
from Newton.

12
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,060
Um,
and those,

13
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,680
those things have shaped me and complex
and confusing ways.

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,150
If my parents were from a particular
millia in,

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,940
in Russia,
a particular intellectual,

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,650
social millia,
my mom was a literary critic and,

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,820
um,
then they came to Newton,

18
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,330
um,
where they sort of managed to

19
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:18,040
reconstruct that,
uh,

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,840
with the other Russians that were there.

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,270
Um,
but it was cut off.

22
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,900
It was a world that they were cut off
from the American world that surrounded

23
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:29,980
them.
So it was sort of island of a Russian,

24
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,520
a computer programmers and
intellectuals,

25
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,320
um,
in a prosperous American suburb.

26
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,960
Um,
and for me that was,

27
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,610
um,
it was confusing because I very much

28
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:48,510
wanted to be an American.
I wanted to,

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,280
uh,
fit in with the rest of the kids.

30
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:52,300
And,
um,

31
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:54,790
I wanted to engage with American life.
I wasn't,

32
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,170
I didn't want to sit at home with my
parents and the Russian books and

33
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,300
drinking tea all the time.
Um,

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,690
but at the same time,
I,

35
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,930
I knew I could,
I sensed,

36
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:10,480
even though I didn't acknowledge until a
bit later,

37
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:11,380
that,
uh,

38
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,840
my parents were,
it was a very rich world.

39
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,620
Um,
and I didn't really understand it very

40
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:21,820
well until I started going back to
Russia when I was in my early twenties,

41
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,310
and,
and seeing the world that they'd come

42
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,800
from and,
and understanding what their place in

43
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:27,640
that world had been.

44
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,520
Um,
and that's been

45
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,340
something that I have been sort of
working and thinking about,

46
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,120
uh,
for a while.

47
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:38,590
And,
and,

48
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,190
and this book is really the first time
that I've actually,

49
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,890
uh,
really started getting added.

50
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,870
Uh,
the book is,

51
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,660
it's not about,
it's not about Russian immigrants by any

52
00:02:49,661 --> 00:02:50,494
means.
Uh,

53
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,370
but that's kind of in the background.
Um,

54
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,050
the problem of,
of being a person who,

55
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,400
who has a lot of ideas,
um,

56
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,220
uh,
comes a culture that's filled with

57
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,840
ideas,
um,

58
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,500
and is confronted with an American
reality that is not particularly

59
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:10,480
interested in ideas at all.
So my parents growing up,

60
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,120
there was just no context for them.
Um,

61
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,430
they were these strange people,
uh,

62
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,280
living on woodcliff road,
um,

63
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,870
in,
in our little house.

64
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,160
Um,
and then when I was going to Moscow in

65
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:27,670
the 90s,
I found a whole world of people just

66
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:29,020
like my parents.

67
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,820
Um,
and so,

68
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,830
uh,
it just put them into a context that I

69
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:37,831
could understand
for me with regard to this stuff,

70
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,680
a very important experience was toward
my,

71
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,840
uh,
toward the end of my senior year when I

72
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,430
was working on my thesis.
I was,

73
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,880
um,
I was a major,

74
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:55,090
my major was Russia and America,
but I ended up writing on a ts Elliot,

75
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,210
who is neither really even,
not even very American.

76
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,850
Uh,
he had spent a lot of time in England,

77
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,180
um,
but one of the,

78
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,510
uh,
one of the groups of people that,

79
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:10,240
that Elliot meant the most to in the
states where these people are on the

80
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:12,040
partisan review.
And,

81
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,031
um,
I didn't,

82
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:14,950
I hadn't really known about these people
at all.

83
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,840
Um,
they're not,

84
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,780
uh,
they weren't really part of the college

85
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,250
curriculum.
Um,

86
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,830
and they were,
uh,

87
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,970
and I discovered these people who
basically were first generation

88
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,440
immigrants from Russia.

89
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,960
Um,
so a Philip Rov,

90
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:34,560
the editor of the partisan review was
actually Ivan Greenberg.

91
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,170
Um,
he,

92
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,710
he was born in Russia,
came over when he was little,

93
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,980
um,
saul bellow as born in Petersburg.

94
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,450
Um,
and,

95
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:46,900
and his parents left when he was still a
baby.

96
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,800
Um,
and so these people who are all been

97
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:53,290
born around 1920,
um,

98
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,070
so they were the age of my grandparents
had actually had very similar

99
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:59,680
experiences to me,
um,

100
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,320
in a way where they had,
uh,

101
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,970
their parents were,
were,

102
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,610
were foreigners.
They didn't speak English very well.

103
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,490
Um,
and yet they very much wanted to be part

104
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,200
of a American intellectual life.
So discovering those people and feeling

105
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:14,861
like I,
in fact,

106
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:18,220
I had a very similar experience to those
people and that they were,

107
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,940
um,
a much more experience that was much

108
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:25,000
more like mine than,
than that of my contemporaries that of

109
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:27,760
my American Jewish contemporaries.

110
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,160
Uh,
that was a very,

111
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,160
uh,
important experience for me.

112
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,590
And that has allowed me to,
um,

113
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,140
I think develop a way of,
of writing about Russia and thinking

114
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,120
about Russia,
thinking about this place that I had

115
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,920
come from.
And that had been very important to me

116
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:48,540
and certainly to my reading development,
um,

117
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,810
or writing about it in America because
that's what these people had done.

118
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,020
And they were all still very interested
in Russia and the Soviet Union.

119
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,040
Um,
and they were,

120
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,280
they were using these things to
understand American life.

121
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,451
So,
you know,

122
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:03,950
so irving Howe and,
and,

123
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:06,270
uh,
Saul bellow or people who,

124
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,330
who have helped me a great deal.
