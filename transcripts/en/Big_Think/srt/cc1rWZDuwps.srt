1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,430
Well,
I don't think we'll engineer our way out

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:09,270
of the energy crisis,
but I think if we adopt a series of

3
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:10,810
prudent policies,
uh,

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,520
uh,
we may get there and by that I think we

5
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:18,540
need a lot greater attention paid to
energy efficiency,

6
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:23,541
which is still the single best way to
deal with the energy situation is not to

7
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:25,950
use it.
If there's a way to,

8
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:27,300
uh,
to do so.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,220
And I'm not talking about,
you know,

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,190
sitting in the dark,
I'm talking about simply a better

11
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:35,310
technology that gives you the same bang
for the buck.

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,800
But if we focus on energy technology,
if we moved towards cleaner vehicles and

13
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:44,910
our transportation sector and our
electric utility sector,

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:45,950
I think,
uh,

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,160
you know,
we can get there,

16
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:49,770
but it's a,
it's a hard slog because,

17
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:51,540
um,
while we talk about,

18
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,390
you know,
needing to reduce our energy consumption

19
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:56,460
because of concerns about climate
change,

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,300
I always like to remind people that
they're roughly one point 6 billion

21
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:05,301
people in the world who have no access
to electricity and even more who have no

22
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:09,600
access to commercial energy.
And we can't forget those people.

23
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:10,434
As we,
uh,

24
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,600
uh,
deal with our own part of the problem.

25
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,680
Well,
it's certainly not,

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,640
not only not fair from a human,
a human point of view,

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,110
but I think it's more ominous than that.
I think in the kind of world we live in,

28
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:28,740
in modern communications and people who
have very little,

29
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,180
certainly aren't unaware of how those of
us that have very much live and I think

30
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:37,740
at some point we're going to start
seeing a increased political violence

31
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:41,610
and potential increased risks of
terrorism rather than just have people

32
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:45,690
wallow in their misery and kind of die
unnoticed by the rest of us.

33
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,730
Well,
some of the developing countries,

34
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,660
of course being very poor countries,
I'm thinking particularly maybe some of

35
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:57,620
the Central African countries,
uh,

36
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,230
they're problem is they don't have the
resources to do what they need to do,

37
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:02,370
to adopt,
to,

38
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:03,390
uh,
uh,

39
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,380
to climate change or to take actions to
mitigate the effects of climate change.

40
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,770
Many of these countries are suffering
from deforestation or growing incursions

41
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:15,450
by the desert,
what we call desertification.

42
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,350
And increasingly many,
many parts of their countries are

43
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:22,680
uninhabitable.
We're beginning to see climate refugees

44
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:26,520
move across international frontiers in
response to these changes.

45
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,330
So I think we need to go in with
renewable energy technologies,

46
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,820
uh,
that makes sense given the local

47
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:36,600
environment and try to provide a better
modicum of life,

48
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,010
but also to dissuade them from
continuing to denude,

49
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:41,940
uh,
uh,

50
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:43,980
the remaining forest that they have.

51
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,050
Well in many parts and many parts of the
emerging market countries,

52
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:53,790
uh,
I think wind and solar offer probably

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,720
the two greatest potentials,
uh,

54
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,650
uh,
certainly all of North Africa has a

55
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,680
great solar resources and a lot of the
desert regions have pretty consistent

56
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:06,940
wins.
So you want to start with that and then

57
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:09,420
you need to use those technologies,
you know,

58
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,270
to help with wells,
develop water supplies and wind and

59
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,070
solar,
uh,

60
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,470
uh,
generated electricity can help alleviate

61
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:19,000
those kinds of problems as well.
