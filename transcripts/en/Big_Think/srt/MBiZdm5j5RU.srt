1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,840
The one thing that impresses me every
time I go into the sea and it should

2
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:14,680
impress everyone,
is the abundance of life.

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,250
The ocean is not just rocks and water
from the surface,

4
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,310
it looks pretty much the same everywhere
you go.

5
00:00:21,311 --> 00:00:25,210
Sometimes it's a little bluer,
greener or grayer than others,

6
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:30,211
but most people I think have the
impression that it's all about water and

7
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:33,040
water of course,
is the key to life.

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,240
It's a single non negotiable thing that
life requires,

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,140
but because most diverse water is ocean,
you kind of expect that's where most of

10
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:48,010
life will be in and that's the fact that
is the way it is.

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,630
Dive into the ocean.
There's life all the way down.

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,030
It's like diving into the history of
life on earth to look around when you're

13
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:02,470
in the sea because you see not just our
fellow vertebrates,

14
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:03,640
so there there are plenty of them.

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,110
The fish and some cases you have lucky
encounters with whales or dolphins.

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,410
You might see turtles,
fellow vertebrates.

17
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,230
You might even see if you're in the
Galapagos islands,

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,540
Iguanas,
fellow vertebrates,

19
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,590
but the great sweep of life is mostly
not about vertebrates.

20
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,320
It's about the invertebrates creatures
without backbones starting with a little

21
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,470
tiny things.
The microbes that rule the world,

22
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,250
they were in the ocean in abundance long
before there were organisms that had

23
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:44,851
multicellular structure,
so having a chance to dive in and to be

24
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:51,130
aware even though you can't see them,
you know that you're surrounded by this

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,700
great sweep of tiny things that generate
much of the oxygen that grab much of the

26
00:01:57,941 --> 00:02:02,941
carbon out of the atmosphere,
the photosynthetic bacteria and other

27
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:08,170
forms of photosynthetic life that are in
abundance.

28
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:11,590
In plankton,
you can't really see them for the most

29
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:15,740
part unless you have high magnification
and divers usually just have a face

30
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:16,574
mask.

31
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,120
You might see that the water's a little
greener or not.

32
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,670
Sometimes you can actually see little
particles,

33
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,170
but those are relatively large compared
to those really tiny things that even

34
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:31,510
with the closest look you can deliver
with your eyes.

35
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:36,511
You really can't see the bacteria that
are there and in great abundance and in

36
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,500
just a,
you know,

37
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,270
a cup of water.
You may have millions of bacteria,

38
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,370
may have a thousand different kinds of
these little microbes.

39
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,610
It looks like water,
but it's still filled with life,

40
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,980
and of course there are the bigger
things.

41
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,860
You're down on the bottom.
You might see sponges.

42
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:02,110
They've been around for hundreds of
millions of years,

43
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,750
400,
$500,

44
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,210
million years.
You might see starfish.

45
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,940
There are ancient citizens to that.
Go back 500 million years.

46
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,400
You might see jellyfish pulsing by think
about 500 million years,

47
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,920
half a billion years.
Then you see some other creatures that

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,040
have taken a little longer to form in
terms of looking at the history of life

49
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:34,264
on earth.

50
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,330
Horseshoe crabs have a history that goes
back perhaps as much as 400 million

51
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:43,450
years,
but other arthropods creatures that have

52
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:46,030
jointed legs,
crabs,

53
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,460
a horseshoe,
crabs aren't true.

54
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,150
Crabs there clip more closely related to
spiders and Scorpions even though

55
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:56,990
they're out there in the ocean,
but crabs and shrimp and little Copa

56
00:03:56,991 --> 00:04:01,810
pods that feed on the algae,
the photosynthetic things that formed

57
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:04,210
the basis of much of the great food
chains,

58
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,410
food webs,
and the ocean.

59
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,370
All of that surrounds you as you dive
in.

60
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:14,371
You see creatures whose history preceded
that have certainly humankind or

61
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:19,561
anything closely related to us,
maybe sharks or they have a backbone or

62
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,600
back cartilage anyway that have a
history that goes back at least $300,

63
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:27,450
million years.
We are really newcomers.

64
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,460
Our history is maybe contained within
the last 5 million years or anything

65
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:38,461
like human civilization.
Think about 50,000 years or really when

66
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:45,610
you think about civilization with
language and art and things that we

67
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:50,611
really associate with who we think we
are maybe the last 10,000 years since

68
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:55,810
the end of the last ice age.
That's nothing in the history of the

69
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:58,840
earth or life on earth.
As a diver,

70
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,450
you can.
You can think of yourself as almost an

71
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,950
alien.
A newcomer on this ancient planet filled

72
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:10,951
with creatures whose life preceded that
of humankind by hundreds fruits

73
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,110
of millions of years.
