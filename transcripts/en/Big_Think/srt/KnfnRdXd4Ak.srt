1
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,280
Oh,
absolutely.

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,250
There's nothing wrong with vegetarian
diets and there's nothing wrong with

3
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:15,190
Vegan diets,
so people who eat those kinds of diets

4
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:19,240
are often the healthier than people who
don't because they're eating a lot.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,840
They're doing exactly what my advice is.
They're eating less,

6
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:24,730
they're moving more.
They're eating lots of fruits,

7
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:25,990
vegetables,
and whole grains,

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,030
and they're certainly not eating much
junk food.

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,920
I'm so they're healthier.
