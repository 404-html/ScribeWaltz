1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,750
Is to do it all the time.
The challenge is to sit there basically

2
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:18,410
because there's so many times when you
just want to flee.

3
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,700
Um,
it's,

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,050
it's not the life that I would have
thought.

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,050
Um,
it's more difficult in some ways.

6
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:31,910
The actual act of writing is both more
difficult and more rewarding.

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,140
The re you have searched states of
something like ecstasy in your writing,

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,750
um,
when it goes well,

9
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:45,920
when it goes specially well,
and that's not something you can imagine

10
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,920
when you're first starting out.
It certainly wasn't what happened to me

11
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:52,610
those first few times I wrote poems.
Um,

12
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,330
but then the going on with it is quite
hard.

13
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:59,720
There was a period when I renounced it
when I was,

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,060
oh,
how old was there?

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,800
Right after I published my first book,
my life was a mess.

16
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:11,801
I was separating from my then wife and I
just decided let this life of a poet is

17
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:13,490
Kelly.

18
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,700
May I have to do something else?
But I couldn't.

19
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,730
Well,
I thought of writing screenplays.

20
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,390
I had a friend who was a director in
Hollywood and I said,

21
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:25,910
I want to be a director.
And they said,

22
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,610
that's impossible,
but try writing some screenplays.

23
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,850
So I sat that and I started and I found
it very boring.

24
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,630
So I just sat at my desk for a few
months,

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:40,310
really doing nothing but keeping the
same hours I did when I was writing

26
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:43,970
poetry.
And then I started writing again and I

27
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:47,810
started writing in a new way and it was
very exciting.

28
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:49,340
It was actually after my second book,

29
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,060
it's always difficult question for a
power.

30
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,560
What's next?
Um,

31
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,320
you never know whether you're going to
write another poem.

32
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,910
That's one of the,
I mean,

33
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:11,050
you have faith that you will,
but you never know for sure.

34
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:14,860
You never know for sure.
If the light will come with the force,

35
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:19,861
will take it with the music will happen.
So sometimes I think maybe I should try

36
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:25,450
something else now.
Maybe I should write the novel I never

37
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:29,380
wrote or something.
Although I really have no gift for that

38
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:33,570
or no patience for,
but I hope out,

39
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,210
just write some pounds.
I lie.
