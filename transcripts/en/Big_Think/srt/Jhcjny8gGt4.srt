1
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,970
No,
I don't think

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,220
since we're always much more complicated
than heather positioned,

3
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:20,610
facebook has done a brilliant job of
opening up to third party applications.

4
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,410
The issue isn't opening up its platform.
It's.

5
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:30,450
It has more to do with the individual's
user graph or social graph if you like,

6
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:36,190
which is who their friends are and when
you start doing that you run into these

7
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:37,570
privacy issues.
It's,

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,460
it's fine for me to decide.
You can find out all about me,

9
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:45,310
but as it fine for me to let you see who
all my friends are.

10
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:50,260
Maybe my friends don't want to be known
as my friends and so I shouldn't

11
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:54,790
necessarily have the right to reveal who
all my friends are.

12
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,270
One we'll use hypothetical example is
suppose I'm gay and suppose I'm

13
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,260
sensitive about that.
Know

14
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,800
in theory you shouldn't even be
sensitive about it because it's okay,

15
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:11,530
but some people are are they have to be
in their work or whatever,

16
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,000
and so if I have friends on my favorite
lesbian site,

17
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,950
they might not want me to open up my
social graph to all my friends on

18
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:22,350
facebook who could then say,
oh,

19
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,530
well that's interesting.

20
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:28,530
Esther has all these gay friends so
people get outed by their association

21
00:01:30,251 --> 00:01:31,830
with me.
I mean it's,

22
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:37,190
it's a very complicated thing and I may
have my own reasons for not wanting

23
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,720
certain people to know certain things.
Like I may have

24
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,570
an ex boyfriend that I don't want to see
certain things about my new boyfriend

25
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:50,350
because rather than hating him and
wanting to make him jealous,

26
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:52,270
I still like him or you know,
it's just.

27
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,670
Or I may not want my mother to see
pictures of my stepmother.

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,040
Not Because of privacy,
but because of a certain delicacy.

29
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,670
Again,
I have my own reasons for wanting to

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,140
control this information.
It's not quote privacy,

31
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:10,650
but it's not something where I want even
my friends to plaster my information all

32
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:13,900
over the place.
So it's,

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,150
it's a complicated thing.
What facebook did so brilliantly was

34
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:20,050
they said,
we're,

35
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,380
we're not so much a single community.
They're way too large to be a community.

36
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,550
We are a platform on which people can
build communities,

37
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,030
but no,
we don't want to be a public utility.

38
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,630
We want to be a
proprietary.

39
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:42,631
Ultimately moneymaking utility and
negotiating those shows is really tough

40
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:49,840
and facebook hasn't done it without a
bunch of errors on the way,

41
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,530
but there are basic.
This is what,

42
00:02:53,531 --> 00:02:57,070
yeah,
who should have done and failed to do.

43
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,860
Facebook is doing it.
They're pioneering and they're,

44
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,940
they're,
they're learning by trial and error and

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,960
every little errors being
viciously.

46
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,810
It's a million small mistakes.
I don't know.

47
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,460
I mean the,
the,

48
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,670
the boats were all going by facebook
jumped on and one of them and then

49
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,400
turned it into a much bigger boat.
