1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,450
In my book,
ideal,

2
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:08,451
right away with a meeting of meaning
because I knew I would be attacked like

3
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:13,971
a disturbed nest of Hornets by
philosophers if I did not.

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,130
And of course meeting has a number of
meanings,

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,400
but generally speaking,
after you've gone past the basic

6
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:29,310
religious definition of meaning,
which is,

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,710
well,
of course the divine creator,

8
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,720
uh,
is responsible for the design,

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,360
then a nature of humanity.
And what else do you want to know?

10
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,540
Uh,
after you get past that particular

11
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,980
response?
Uh,

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,180
then the subject moved to meaning as
history.

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,490
That is essentially what are we and why,
where do we come from?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And this is part of meetings who were,
are we was most likely to be headed.

15
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:12,050
And I like to suggest that in order to
answer those questions,

16
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:17,691
we cannot do it with religion because
every religion has or ever religious

17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,980
faith rather has a different creation
story.

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,440
Story of how the universe and earth and
people came into being.

19
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,550
And every faith has its own special
accounts of supernatural events and they

20
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:42,271
differ one from the other and they are
in competition.

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,260
And in any case,
they,

22
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,280
uh,
cannot be boiled down to any kind of a

23
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,580
coherent explanation because religious
face is very much a product of human

24
00:01:56,641 --> 00:02:01,080
culture and we can't really figure out
just what we are,

25
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:06,081
what our meaning is by introspection.
I'm reminded of the statements of Darwin

26
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:12,630
made in one of his notebooks,
which was a,

27
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:17,631
that the mind consciousness cannot be,
uh,

28
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,850
taken by direct assault.
We cannot imagine what we are inside my

29
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:31,530
thinking about it alone.
And,

30
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,720
um,
it can't,

31
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,930
it hasn't been really dented very well
by philosophy.

32
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,890
I like to see that most of the
philosophy which is a declining and

33
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:52,221
highly endangered academic species,
a incidentally a consist of failed

34
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,360
models of how the brain works.

35
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,890
So students going into philosophy,
shorter half to learn what they cart

36
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,250
thought and then after a long while,
while that's wrong,

37
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:11,251
and what a schopenhauer might have
thought and what might've thought or did

38
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:16,720
sink,
but they cannot go on from that position

39
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:21,721
in historical examination of the nature
of humanity to what it really is and how

40
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:29,680
we might define it.
So by default,

41
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,220
the explanation of meaning of humanity
falls to science and we are making

42
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:41,180
progress if I might speak for science,
uh,

43
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,440
and it's from five disciplines and I
will take just a moment to tell you what

44
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:52,591
they are and then it'll make sense as to
why not all of sciences whole by any

45
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:59,090
means,
which is developing exponentially and in

46
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,360
the creation of knowledge faster and
faster,

47
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:06,760
uh,
but from a particular set of disciplines

48
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:08,980
within science,
and I'm going to name them as I

49
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:09,550
approached that.

50
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,120
And I'll say you cannot,
you cannot get the answer from

51
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,270
astrophysics.
There are astrophysicists.

52
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,690
Glad to try to explain to you a
rhetorically in some way or other that

53
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,750
what's the meaning of humanity is and
what their studies of astrophysics tells

54
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:31,720
us about the significance of humanity.
Forget it.

55
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,650
They can't possibly tell you,
nor just astronomers,

56
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,980
nor just chemists,
nor just,

57
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:39,880
um,
well,

58
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:41,710
my own colleagues,
molecular biologists,

59
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,540
they're too far removed from the subject
to make any sensible thing about the

60
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:51,541
meaning of human existence.
Well,

61
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,040
what are the disciplines?
And if you look at these disciplines as

62
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,020
I've done,
and I've actually worked as a

63
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,380
researcher,
a in a couple,

64
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,880
you have to know what the contributions
are of evolutionary biology that is

65
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:14,731
biology scene in a historical context
going all the way back,

66
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:20,080
millions of years to the origin of the
human species.

67
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,360
And then,
uh,

68
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,560
another one,
uh,

69
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:24,850
another science,
of course,

70
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:29,851
it's paleontology,
which segues as we come closer to a

71
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,290
modern humanity and the invention of
agriculture and the birth of the

72
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:39,760
Neolithic period turns into archaeology,
archaeology,

73
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,340
and paleontology which are on different
timescales,

74
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,970
is the other discipline,
another second discipline,

75
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,450
and a third of course.

76
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:53,170
And everybody would know about this now
because it's progressing so rapidly in

77
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:58,171
so many ways,
is bringing science and then coming out

78
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,860
of brain science or running parallel to
it and trading with it.

79
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,710
And depending upon it and deriving from
it,

80
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,030
uh,
is we turned down to a more technology

81
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,800
savvy.
And that is a artificial intelligence.

82
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:22,190
And with a artificial intelligence is
the fifth robotics.

83
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,790
Robotics is so important as Hollywood is
now glommed onto knowing a good story

84
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:35,651
when they see one robotics included,
of course the notion of studying the

85
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:40,961
mind in perfecting artificial
intelligence and more than that,

86
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,620
creating what the artificial
intelligence and robotics people call

87
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,410
whole brain emulation that is using
robots as avatars and creating robots

88
00:06:56,571 --> 00:07:01,100
that are designed by design and
imitation of what we know about the

89
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:06,101
brain more and more like humans.
All those five disciplines to get

90
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:11,510
together,
making bridges here and there are

91
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:16,511
beginning to tell us what's the meaning
of humanity is a product of a grand epic

92
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,730
and it's a full story of humanity and
we're just beginning to just draw it in

93
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,340
clarity and a,
let me just add to that why I'm leaving

94
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:34,580
out.

95
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,580
History of the whole human species
should kinetic as well as cultural.

96
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,410
Uh,
you have no chance whatsoever in

97
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,590
defining the meaning of human existence
because

98
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,820
history that goes back essentially to
the origin of literacy history makes no

99
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:03,340
sense without prehistory.
That is to say,

100
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,940
uh,
the biological evolution says lead up to

101
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:12,941
the human condition as the beginning of
history and prehistory in turn is a

102
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:20,151
study of our ancestors going right back
into the animal kingdom,

103
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,260
makes no sense without biology.
So we have to have a constant building,

104
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:30,860
a concatenation of ideas and
information,

105
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,310
discipline to discipline across scales
of the totality of the human population

106
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,740
and scales of time going back actually
millions of years to our early prehuman

107
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,440
ancestors and then forward to the era of
cultural evolution.

108
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,950
And then we will have the story of
humanity and then we will not ask in a

109
00:08:58,161 --> 00:09:01,040
quizzical manner what is the meaning of
life?

110
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,100
What is the meaning of human existence?
We will have our answers.
