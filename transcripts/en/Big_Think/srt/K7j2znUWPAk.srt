1
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,070
Don't use that example and I think
clearly it's a challenge to complete the

2
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:21,520
whole a bicycle wheel around that happen

3
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,090
in the upper west side.
Then the,

4
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:28,750
I mean,
especially to the north,

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,700
you necessarily to work a lot to
complete the uh,

6
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,360
pedestrian and bicycle walk.
We buy the water side.

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,240
There are many,
many streets were protected bicycle way

8
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,370
needed because I'm,
some even seems to be,

9
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,780
I mean some were painted initially and
now they seem to be getting rid of them

10
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,730
like intense three days,
you know,

11
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:58,320
it's like getting a race.
The ones that was painted so clearly.

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,620
Clearly there is a space in New York,
which is the real issue is the parking

13
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:07,290
space for cars in the streets.
I mean

14
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,170
the United States constitution has as
many rights people in the United States

15
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:17,400
have a right to live without fear,
without crime.

16
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,300
They have a right to free education.
They have a right to,

17
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,870
to work,
to have many rights,

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,250
but they.
Parking is not a constitutional right,

19
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,723
eh?

20
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,620
I think it should be questioned more
seriously,

21
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:38,940
whether it's how to use this space,
which has now been taken by cars,

22
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:43,941
parking by the curb side is that small
minority of people who are taking up

23
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:49,251
these extremely valuable space in the
streets of New York to park and I think

24
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,940
in many streets do you call the red
guard rail parking and make some much

25
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:57,480
bigger side.
We'll just make some fantastic protected

26
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,080
bicycle ways in all directions.
Some regulations I think also have to be

27
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:07,730
enacted so that people can walk in with
bicycles into,

28
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,660
into the elevators and into the
hallways.

29
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,820
I saw that.
I mean,

30
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,450
if people can go with dogs or we shows
into a,

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,710
into a hallway or in a little later,
why not go with a bicycle,

32
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,630
but this New York,
I think Manhattan in particular is the

33
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:29,631
perfect city to,
for everybody to move by bicycle and

34
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:32,690
even in the,
in the winter is possible in most of the

35
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:33,381
winter with,
uh,

36
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:34,250
some,
uh,

37
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,873
some,
uh,

38
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,550
coats
to go by bicycle level

39
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,150
everywhere.
