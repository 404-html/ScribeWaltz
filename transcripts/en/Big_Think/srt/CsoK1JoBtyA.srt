1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,020
One of the reasons why computer security
is so hard is because you have to get

2
00:00:06,021 --> 00:00:08,750
absolutely everything right in order to
have a secure system.

3
00:00:08,751 --> 00:00:11,060
And there's lots of different kinds of
things you can get wrong.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,270
Everything from your software was Buggy,
your passwords were too weak,

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,180
you publish your passwords accidentally,
your hardware was insecure,

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,800
they user made a mistake and fell victim
to a phishing attack and gave their

7
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:26,040
credentials to,
uh,

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,770
a foreign agent or a bad guy,
right?

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,240
All of those things have to be done
correctly in order to have a secure

10
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,190
system,
right?

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,300
It might seem tempting to think in,
everybody has a cell phone,

12
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,600
so you could just use your cell phone to
do voting like we do for American idol

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,600
or similar TV shows.
It works for American idol because

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,240
nobody cares all that much who wins or
doesn't win.

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,880
If you get the wrong outcome,
some people will care,

16
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:49,310
but it won't affect sort of the future
of the country,

17
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:50,810
for example.
Um,

18
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,380
it's not sensible to use cell phones for
voting for things that matter.

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,770
National elections,
for example,

20
00:00:57,771 --> 00:01:02,390
because the software on a phone is
enormous and very complicated.

21
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,580
And so understanding that that code is
correct and actually counting all of the

22
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:09,900
votes appropriately would be a task that
would be,

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,610
it's so complex is to be infeasible.
You could have,

24
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:15,680
you know,
the legitimate APP that it is designed

25
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,870
to correctly count the votes for an
election,

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,930
but somebody could hack into that set of
applications and,

27
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:24,680
and,
and plant bugs in a bunch of different

28
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:27,560
cell phones so that the final results
were,

29
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,310
uh,
not the actual intent didn't actually

30
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:35,960
capture the intensive all the voters.
So a system for voting that relies

31
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:40,490
entirely on computers to do all of the
voting will never be secure because

32
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,060
you'll never have enough confidence that
the code that was running on those

33
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:48,470
computers correctly,
cow counted the votes as the person who

34
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:49,400
voted intended.

35
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,030
There's always the chance that there
were bugs or that a hacker came and

36
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:56,600
changed the code or a corrupted the code
to make the result be what the hacker

37
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:58,400
wanted instead of what the voters
wanted.

38
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,430
Um,
so one of the things to know about how

39
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:05,870
the U s election system works is that
voting machines are the purview of

40
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:09,230
states.
So every state has their own process for

41
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:12,710
deciding how,
what technology to use to count votes.

42
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,140
And so it's not that there's not a
monoculture where every single votings

43
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,960
site has the same technology.
It's determined on a state by state

44
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:23,030
basis.
So you have 50 different state

45
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:27,200
authorities at least who were deciding
what technology to use on for that

46
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:29,840
particular state.
And there are different technologies in

47
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:32,840
play.
One of the technologies is just a

48
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,380
touchscreen where you go when you tap
the choices that you want and it records

49
00:02:36,381 --> 00:02:37,550
it in the computer program.

50
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,160
10 states currently have that kind of
technology,

51
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:44,330
and from a cybersecurity perspective
that technology is terrible because what

52
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:49,331
computers do is exactly what they're
told to do by the last person who loaded

53
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:52,100
code onto the system.
I think people who don't know very much

54
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:55,160
about computers tend to think that
computers do the right thing,

55
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,070
but in fact they just do exactly what
they're told to do.

56
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,100
So if they're told to do the correct
thing by a person who has the authority

57
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,930
to tell them,
then that's great.

58
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:07,990
But that's often not what happens.
The voting systems that just have the

59
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:10,720
touch screen,
there's no way of auditing what happened

60
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:12,400
retroactively.
It just a question of,

61
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,170
you know,
did the system actually counted

62
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,190
correctly?
You don't know.

63
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:17,170
All you have at the end of the day is
the collection of,

64
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:20,350
of totals.
So somebody could have replaced the

65
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:23,650
code,
hacked in and made it count in a

66
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:25,600
slightly skewed way,
in a very skewed way.

67
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,420
You really have no way of telling.
So that technology is bad.

68
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,080
People pretty much know that technology
is bad and it's being phased out.

69
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:35,230
So no one is trying to buy more of these
machines at this point and they're no

70
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:38,380
longer being manufactured.
So we're trending in a good direction as

71
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:40,540
far as that's concerned.
Um,

72
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,350
a different kind of machine or the
optical scanning machines where you fill

73
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:46,030
out,
it's kind of like a scan tron form from

74
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:49,780
elementary school where you fill out the
multiple choice questions on the form

75
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,400
and then the form is read electronically
and now the program that's doing the

76
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,880
reading has all the problems of the
system that I talked about before where

77
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,110
it is software that scanning and
counting and could be buggy,

78
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:04,990
could be corrupted by somebody who's
hacking in,

79
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,800
but you still have that paper records so
you can go back after the fact and audit

80
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,280
to confirm that the report that the
amount,

81
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:16,450
the total that was reported was actually
the correct and so that that post facto

82
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:18,430
audit and capability is really
important.

83
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,750
Most states use this technology.
Now some states have in place an

84
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:25,960
automatic auditing process,
so independent of whether any candidate

85
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:29,560
asks for an audit,
they go and pick some number of the

86
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,560
voting districts and some number of the
ballots and they checked to make sure

87
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:36,490
that the counting process was correct.
I think probably the level of auditing

88
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:39,040
isn't sufficient.
There needs to be broader auditing and

89
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,340
more random auditing going on,
but it's definitely a step in the right

90
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:44,950
direction.
The principle that people in this who

91
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,470
work in this area talk about is they
want to make sure that they can

92
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:52,300
guarantee the results are correct,
even if a nefarious person wrote the

93
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:55,510
code that did the counting.
So it has to work,

94
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,880
even if the software was completely
buggy.

95
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,310
And this,
uh,

96
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,710
optical scanning reading technology
satisfies that characteristic because

97
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:07,711
even if the code that does the fit,
the counting of the scan tron form is

98
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:10,720
buggy.
They can go look at the physical forms

99
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:14,740
and figure out that there was a mistake
and correct it using different software.

100
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,710
So there an audibility capability that
exists in that,

101
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,610
that kind of technology that doesn't
exist if you have no paper trail.

102
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,550
So I think at this point we kind of know
how to do it.

103
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,940
And from a tactical point of view,
and the question is getting the states

104
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:30,040
all to shift to that new kind of
technology.

105
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,953
Hmm.

106
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:37,180
Yeah.
