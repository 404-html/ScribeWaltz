1
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,840
It's funny cause I was talking about
this with a woman named Amy Aright,

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,020
who was one of the co founders of e
trade and,

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,000
uh,
Olivia cruises the other day.

4
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:20,930
We were on a panel together at a gay Mba
conference and we were talking a little

5
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:23,120
bit about what it,
what does it mean to be an entrepreneur

6
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:26,510
and what are the challenges?
And both of us sort of asserted that

7
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:29,330
there really weren't any as far as we
could tell.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,030
And principally I believe that,
um,

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,840
there's still a ton of homophobia in the
world and there's a ton of homophobia in

10
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:39,950
the business world.
But because I've been very out and very

11
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:43,100
explicitly out in my life,
I'm in my professional life from the

12
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:44,360
beginning.
I just don't hear it.

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,230
So if you don't like me because I'm gay
or you don't want to do business with me

14
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:50,330
because I'm gay,
then I probably just don't even know

15
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:52,250
that because you're just steering clear
of me.

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,800
You know,
it's when you're closeted and people

17
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:57,980
don't know that you're gay,
that you hear and see the things that

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,930
are otherwise unsavory,
you know?

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,770
And I just,
I don't necessarily want to change

20
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:07,100
everybody's mind in the world about,
um,

21
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,470
you know,
about homosexuality or Judaism is I'm a

22
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:11,810
Jew and,
or you know,

23
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:13,790
any of the things that I'm passionate
about,

24
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,400
but I want to do.
One is I do want to be in an environment

25
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:19,730
in which I'm respected and I have an
equal opportunity to be successful.

26
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,750
And so I'm creating that every single
day by putting my parameters out there

27
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:24,800
and saying,
this is who I am.

28
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,450
I'm gay,
Jewish,

29
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:27,860
Chubby,
you know,

30
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,300
uh,
now in my mid thirties,

31
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:30,590
this is who I am.
And,

32
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,200
uh,
now you can self select out of my world

33
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:35,030
if you'd like.
And you know,

34
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,800
so be it.
I think one of the,

35
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,860
I think one of the challenges for all
gay professional people is this idea

36
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:44,060
that,
um,

37
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,260
you're going to be faced with a world
that's hostile to you and your lifestyle

38
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:49,880
and you know,
um,

39
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,040
but really it ends up being more
quotidian than that.

40
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,990
I think when you've worked,
especially in the corporate world,

41
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:56,630
which I mostly issued in my,
in my professional career.

42
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,190
But when you're working in the
professional world,

43
00:01:58,191 --> 00:02:02,000
most of that hassle factor of being gay
is that you,

44
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,160
uh,
on Monday morning you come into the

45
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:06,890
office and your friends are talking
about their kids and their,

46
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,410
you know,
their spouse and what they did for the

47
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,690
weekend and the golfing that they did.
And if your lifestyle is not those

48
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:13,880
things,
if you're not a gay person with kids and

49
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:18,881
a spouse and golfing and you're sort of
forced to like interpret what part of

50
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:22,760
your life the other person does or
doesn't want to hear and what's

51
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:26,570
contextually relevant and you know,
what is or isn't going to make them

52
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:28,250
uncomfortable.
And I think,

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,470
um,
I think that's actually a complicated

54
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:31,570
dance,
um,

55
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,810
at first and then over time what you
realize is you gain traction on that.

56
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,950
So not being pollyanna.
I am saying that I think single straight

57
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:43,040
people have some of the same issues in a
culture where,

58
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,750
um,
you're ran a lot of married people are

59
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:45,710
married,
people with children.

60
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,780
There's a sort of expectation often
that,

61
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,610
uh,
people who are married with children can

62
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:52,820
go home at four o'clock because they
have to attend to their kids.

63
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:53,750
And of course who would say,
no,

64
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:55,640
you can't go pick your kids up from
school.

65
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,500
You know,
we're as the single person or the person

66
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:59,740
without kids.
It doesn't get to do things.

67
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,990
Um,
and then I think it's more,

68
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:06,280
I would like a family status equality,
fairness issue than it is a sexuality

69
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:08,320
fairness and equality issue.
And so a lot of,

70
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,620
so to me,
my observation has been that most issues

71
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:16,120
related to sexuality in the workplace
are actually issues of family status and

72
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:18,970
gender and rather than sexuality
strictly speaking.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,290
And that,
um,

74
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,340
once you put those things into context,
then there's a layer of certainly of

75
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:26,590
like explicitly sexuality related
issues.

76
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,950
Um,
but most of it is about family status

77
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:32,200
and gender.
I will say one thing though,

78
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,560
which is I have the benefit of being an
entrepreneur and,

79
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,810
um,
the benefit of living in,

80
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:39,940
you know,
in the technology business and the games

81
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:41,830
industry and,
and being an entrepreneur in those

82
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:43,810
environments.
And so in those,

83
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,650
in the context of entrepreneurship and
technology and,

84
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,800
and the games industry,
um,

85
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,560
of course I can be out.
I mean,

86
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:55,210
it's my company.
So in that way I can build a corporate

87
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:59,380
culture that matches the environment
that I want to work in and are built

88
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:02,860
with people who I respect and who
respect me and who I feel comfortable

89
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:07,360
with and with whom I want to come into
work every single day and enjoy the,

90
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,280
you know,
basically the relationship that I'm

91
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:10,240
building with them.

92
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,000
You know,
and that's a degree of control that I

93
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:15,370
don't have in many other aspects of
being an entrepreneur.

94
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:18,820
But I certainly do in terms of who gets
hired to work at my company.

95
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,900
And,
um,

96
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,630
that's definitely one thing that's a
rewarding about being an entrepreneur

97
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:25,060
that you don't necessarily get when you
work in the corporate world.

98
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:27,550
So I appreciate it if you're,
uh,

99
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,260
you know,
if you're just starting out in your

100
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:31,510
career and you want to go work at,
you know,

101
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:36,280
some big tech finance company or the
Department of defense or something crazy

102
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:38,230
like that,
then your considerations are probably

103
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:39,700
different from mine.
But I,

104
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,340
I try to live a,
I work so much.

105
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,210
I try to integrate my life as much as
possible so that I can enjoy all aspects

106
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:46,420
of it.
