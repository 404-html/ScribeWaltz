1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,200
Preserving economic interests requires
trading and working with governments,

2
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:18,730
like,
for example,

3
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:21,640
trying to,
that violate human rights.

4
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,990
And there are some who would say,
well,

5
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:28,270
you can't do both.
You can't,

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,540
um,
go and talk to the Chinese about

7
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,040
stabilizing,
um,

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,120
the global economy and the steps that we
want them to take to,

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,710
uh,
to help us deal with,

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,960
uh,
obviously a,

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,940
an existential economic crisis and at
the same time lecture them about their

12
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:53,230
treatment of dissidence for prisoners or
the Falun Gong or Tibetans or what have

13
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:55,450
you.
I don't think that's right.

14
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:00,870
I think that the United States and
countries like trying to work together

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,650
on economic matters because it's in
their mutual interest to do so.

16
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,140
I don't think China or any other country
works with us on those issues,

17
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,150
um,
to do us a favor.

18
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,760
They do it because it's in their
interest to do so as well.

19
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,980
Um,
so I don't think we damage ourselves

20
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:25,981
diplomatically if we stand up for our
principals so long as we do it in a

21
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,030
intelligent way.
Um,

22
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,910
and that's the challenge of diplomacy.
It's,

23
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,220
it's doing more than one thing at one
time.

24
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,800
And any secretary of state,
um,

25
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,870
or any president,
um,

26
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,880
who is up to the enormous challenge,
uh,

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,340
of those jobs should be able to do that.
Um,

28
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,430
and I also think that it's unrealistic
to think that,

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,480
uh,
that we can simply drop those issues.

30
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,840
You know,
you can go into a meeting with the

31
00:01:58,841 --> 00:02:01,390
Chinese and say,
you know what,

32
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,090
we're,
we're,

33
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,010
we just can't afford to raise the case
of that dissident.

34
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,930
We can't afford to lecture them about
the port Tibetans because we've got to

35
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:14,260
save the global economy.
And then three months later,

36
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:15,970
something awful is going to happen in
Tibet.

37
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,590
And guess what?

38
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,280
The United States government is going to
have to say something about it because

39
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:23,020
it would be politically impossible not
to.

40
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,950
And then the Chinese having seen the
pattern of silence become even more

41
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:33,160
upset.
They'll say,

42
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:35,830
where does that come from?
We thought you weren't talking to us

43
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:38,890
about that stuff anymore.
And the diplomatic costs are even

44
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:42,200
greater.
So I think for,

45
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:44,890
you know,
realistic diplomatic reasons,

46
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:49,891
it's better just to be principled and
consistent and send the message out to

47
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:52,200
every country that we work with around
the world.

48
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,160
You know,
that's just part of doing business with

49
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:57,100
the United States that we're going to
raise those issues.

50
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,930
It's because it's who we are.
It's what we believe.

51
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,380
I Dunno about self determination,
but sovereignty,

52
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,970
a state sovereignty is often used as an
argument against intervening to stop

53
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,600
human rights abuses.
Um,

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,220
and it's a complicated set of arguments.
Um,

55
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,520
but certainly in cases where you have
extreme violence against civilians,

56
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,510
um,
the threat or reality of mass killing

57
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,080
and genocide,
I believe in,

58
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:37,081
in fact the United Nations has adopted a
principle of responsibility to protect,

59
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,140
to deal with those situations.
That if,

60
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:44,890
if a state is failing and it's
responsibility to protect its own people

61
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,640
from those kinds of abuses,
then the rest of the world has a

62
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:52,920
responsibility to step in in whatever
way may be effective.

63
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,420
Now,
what if we're talking about,

64
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,050
um,
less extreme violations of human rights

65
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,330
torture or a newspapers being closed
down or people being in prison because

66
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:05,530
of,
um,

67
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,060
because they're expressing their views.
Uh,

68
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,200
you know,
I think very few people argue that those

69
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:14,460
cases merit military intervention,
uh,

70
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,020
invading a country to take down it's
government.

71
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,780
But there are other tools that I think
are appropriate to use to pressure

72
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:26,320
countries to change their behavior,
uh,

73
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,780
partly because it's the right thing to
do,

74
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,760
partly because there are legal
obligations being violated when

75
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,640
governments violate human rights in
those ways.

76
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,060
And partly because we have a self
interest in,

77
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,550
um,
as Americans,

78
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,191
uh,
in,

79
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:48,191
in building a world in which governments
treat their people better than a lot of

80
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:50,920
reasons for that.
So,

81
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,100
um,
so I don't think that sovereignty is an

82
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:58,480
absolute bar to one country or one group
of people,

83
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,590
um,
promoting human rights beyond their

84
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,550
political borders.

85
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,470
The United States can't be an effective
champion of human rights anywhere,

86
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,500
if it's a generally seen around the
world as a violator of human rights.

87
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,470
And so when the Bush administration was
not just engaging that justifying

88
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,650
practices like torture and disappearing
people in secret prisons and long term

89
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,870
detention without charge,
uh,

90
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,150
it,
it was very difficult,

91
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:37,840
not impossible interestingly,
but difficult for the United States to

92
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:40,690
effectively urge other countries not to
do those things.

93
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,330
I do think,
although I'm critical of some of the

94
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:45,250
things that the Obama administration has
done,

95
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:49,180
that,
that he has gone a long way towards,

96
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,970
uh,
not just eliminating those practices but

97
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:55,150
convincing the world that they are being
eliminated.

98
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,830
I think this is actually a moment,
uh,

99
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,410
perhaps a rare moment when,
um,

100
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,370
the United States government and
particularly the president has a lot of

101
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:07,330
moral credibility to,
um,

102
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,750
go to the world and champion and end to
torture and,

103
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,540
um,
fair trials for everybody and freedom of

104
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,090
the press and freedom of speech.
Uh,

105
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,500
that moment may not last,
but we do have a moment like that now

106
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:25,970
and it's important that it be used
effectively and wisely.

107
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,460
Technology can be used to suppress human
rights and to facilitate human rights.

108
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,500
That's always been the case.
Um,

109
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,340
there's never been one technology that,
uh,

110
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,530
is beneficial only to one side and that
struggle.

111
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,740
So governments like China and Iran can
use the Internet to monitor,

112
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,153
uh,
the,

113
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,260
you know,
their people's communication,

114
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,050
um,
to try to identify dissidence,

115
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,440
um,
and go after them individually.

116
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,360
But of course,
um,

117
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,950
campaigners for democracy and human
rights can also use these technologies

118
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:06,320
as we saw in Iran,
um,

119
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,440
to get around government restrictions on
speech.

120
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,430
And it's a,
it's a tug of war between the,

121
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,590
the dark side of the Internet and the,
and the good side.

122
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,950
Um,
and there's a lot that the United States

123
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:20,780
can do to,
uh,

124
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,510
to help the,
the good side when in that fight.

125
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,610
Um,
for example,

126
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:30,611
there are really interesting
technologies being developed that allow

127
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:35,920
people to communicate privately,
um,

128
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,600
to defeat surveillance and to defeat
censorship,

129
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,170
um,
programs that can be downloaded,

130
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,160
um,
by folks in Iran and China and Burma and

131
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:46,994
Vietnam.

132
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,580
Um,
and it's something that we've asked the

133
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:51,230
US government to,
uh,

134
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,470
to fund and support.
There's also,

135
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,370
um,
a very interesting and ambiguous role

136
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:03,371
played by a American technology
companies like Google and Yahoo and

137
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,620
Cisco.
Um,

138
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,890
these are the companies that develop
these liberating technologies that,

139
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,980
uh,
dissidents in Iran and China use,

140
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,860
but they've also sometimes partnered
with the governments,

141
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,240
um,
to give them,

142
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,300
um,
the technology they use to suppress

143
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,940
dissent.
Um,

144
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,620
they've censored their own content
sometimes.

145
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:30,190
And so helping these companies figure
out what their responsibilities are when

146
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:36,101
they are operating in dictatorships and
backing them up when they have to stand

147
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:41,170
up to those governments is a really
important challenge for the 20th.

148
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,350
[inaudible].
