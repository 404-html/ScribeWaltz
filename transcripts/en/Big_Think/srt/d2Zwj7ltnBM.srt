1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,040
Surrounds us so profound,
90 to 98 percent,

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,120
that eight percent difference from thing
you read to the your raid is dark energy

3
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:25,270
or dark matter.
We don't know what it is.

4
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,750
We don't know what 98 percent of the
universe is and this wonderful man

5
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,700
Einstein,
this wonderful man who imagined the

6
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:42,280
scientific theories,
much like the Greeks who said,

7
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:45,490
all right,
if you cut something in half,

8
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:49,180
you've got to have the cut that half and
you keep going down the line.

9
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,770
You must come to the end and they said,
we'll call it an Adam,

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,110
and that's how they made their
scientific discoveries through the logic

11
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:04,111
of imagination.
Whereas we have tools to dimly dimly see

12
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,850
into the physical nature dimly see a
law.

13
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:11,350
Yeah.
That seems to be a law.

14
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,230
Wait a minute.
There's something here that counteracts

15
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:18,520
that law,
so just like our diets,

16
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,690
the pyramid,
carbohydrates,

17
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:28,090
a little bit of meat.
One day is 180 degrees reverse.

18
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:28,601
No,
no,

19
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:31,990
no.
What we meant was protein and a little

20
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,820
bit of carbohydrate.
Exactly.

21
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:36,640
One hundred 80 degrees different in your
diet.

22
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,920
That's what's happening in science all
the time.

23
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,450
There's a wonderful line science
scientists spread rumors.

24
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,170
We know everything is unified.
We know if we use our imagination like

25
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:53,500
the Greeks,
we look around us and we say the whole

26
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:56,380
world is unified.
Electrically.

27
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,620
Adams thing matter.
There's got to be a operating

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,510
the thing that has to be managed in some
way.

29
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,990
It's their.
Everything follows a logic.

30
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,100
We had these little instruments that
peer into the universe.

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,040
We're seeing a SPEC.
We're seeing a dust.

32
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:23,041
Mote
wouldn't the theory of everything.

33
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,150
Maybe you discover that as you die,
maybe as you die,

34
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:33,970
you though there's the theory of
everything.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,380
Boom,
and you're dead.
