00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,100
Bye love you work.
My name is Charlie,

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,210
my questions days associated with you as
a scientist and how you've evolved over

3
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:14,890
time to deal with both sides itself and
the ethics and morals associated with

4
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:15,724
sites.
So,

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,290
um,
I'll start off with this quote.

6
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:20,800
So science can tell you how to clean a
tyrannosaurus rex humanities can tell

7
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:24,640
you why this might be a bad idea.
So my question today is whether or not

8
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:26,100
you prefer to deal with,
um,

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,470
the like morals and ethics associated
with scientific concepts or the

10
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:32,590
exploration and explanation of the
concepts themselves and which one

11
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:33,940
engages you to a greater extent.

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,880
Charlie,
this is a great question,

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,970
but in mathematics you may have run
across the word integer and you know,

14
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:45,150
may know the word integral and you may
know the word integral.

15
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:49,050
It's integral to my outlook or whatever.
What we want is for everybody to be a

16
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:52,230
complete person with a complete point of
view,

17
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:56,130
a complete understanding of the process
of science,

18
00:00:56,131 --> 00:01:01,080
which enables humankind to know nature,
but also to have an appreciation for

19
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:03,270
what it means to be a member of the
tribe,

20
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,120
to be a human,
to be living here on earth with other

21
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:10,380
humans and other species.
So we want you to have both an

22
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:15,381
appreciation for the process of science
and an appreciation for ethics or what

23
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:20,421
seems to be the best way to live,
the best way to conduct yourself on

24
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:25,290
earth and especially in the human tribe.
So with that said,

25
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,380
when it comes to ethics,
I always pretty much always harken to

26
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:32,154
evolution.

27
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,670
And here's the extraordinary claim,
and you can evaluate this charlie,

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,180
that not only is our size and shape the
number of fingers,

29
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:41,010
we have our eye color,
hair color,

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,040
skin color associated with our ancestors
and the genes that were passed to us

31
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:49,470
through the process of evolution.
But furthermore,

32
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:54,471
what we feel is a result of evolution.
Our ancestors who were antisocial jerks

33
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,300
got pushed aside by the ones that were
perhaps more social and less jerky.

34
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,950
However,
you don't want to be meek.

35
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,060
You want to have the right level of
aggression in the right level of

36
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,970
accommodation with your fellow
creatures.

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,310
And uh,
when it comes to ethics,

38
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,060
when you look at whatever scheme you
feel is most reasonable to pass your

39
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:29,001
genes on into the future,
that usually leads to what we all

40
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:33,240
consider ethical behavior.
And the classic example,

41
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:35,460
and this is not my fault,
don't come running to me Charlie.

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,440
Okay,
this,

43
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:39,120
this is a thought experiment,
Charlie.

44
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,440
Okay,
don't bust my chops.

45
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:43,410
It's not a real thing.
The house is on fire.

46
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,740
You have a chance to either save your
son or your grandson by the rules of

47
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:51,870
this thought experiment.
You can't save both.

48
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,400
There's no,
you can't say,

49
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:56,350
well I find a fire hose and I call in
uh,

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,560
the terminator and he can walk through
Friday.

51
00:02:58,561 --> 00:02:59,410
No you're not.
No,

52
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,340
you pick your grandson,
you will always pick the grandson.

53
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,170
You will feel that because that passes
the genes farther into the future.

54
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,610
If you're a guy,
if you're a woman,

55
00:03:10,611 --> 00:03:11,090
uh,
the,

56
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,570
uh,
you'll pick whichever offspring is

57
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,340
farthest in the future.
It's the same thing.

58
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,100
So,
uh,

59
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,880
when it comes to how you should treat
other people who are not part of your

60
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:25,870
family,
everybody who's a human is in somehow is

61
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,240
somehow related.
If you go far enough back,

62
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,120
everybody is related.
Troubling is that may seem.

63
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,410
And so you,
this old thing expressed as the golden

64
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:38,110
rule rule,
do unto others as you would have them do

65
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:39,940
unto you.
If you can do that,

66
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:42,490
Charlie,
I think you will get through life as

67
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:45,550
well or better than anyone.
Carry on.
