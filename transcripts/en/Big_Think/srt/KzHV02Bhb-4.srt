1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,480
I think Americans obsessed a lot over
celebrity.

2
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:18,480
But I think the thing that I've written
that you have to remember is a small

3
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:20,070
country.
It,

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,700
you know,
there's an expression that they use

5
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:27,000
saying that you punch above your weight,
which means you kind of play with the

6
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:29,640
big boys when you're not such a big boy.
So Britain,

7
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:32,970
you know,
tries to be more of a kind of world

8
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:37,410
figure than it may be is.
And so it kind of wants to do an America

9
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:39,870
does,
but it doesn't have as many celebrities.

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,680
It doesn't have,
um,

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,350
as many serious things to fill.
It's paper with papers with as America

12
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:48,000
does.
So it,

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,030
um,
it has this weird celebrity culture

14
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:55,530
filled with not that important
celebrities actually a lot of newspapers

15
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:59,220
that it has to sell and a lot of tablets
that are completely,

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,780
um,
hollywoodized.

17
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:03,240
I mean they're all about kind of crap
really.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,670
And um,
and so,

19
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:06,471
so you do,
it's,

20
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:07,770
it's in the culture much more.
I mean,

21
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:11,880
there is a kind of lack of seriousness
and discourse there because of all that.

22
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:14,700
I think it's really brought down the
tone of a lot of the papers,

23
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:15,960
all this celebrity stuff.

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,220
I interviewed him,
um,

25
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,130
right before the dark knight was
rapping.

26
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:26,440
I think he was in his last couple of
months of filming.

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,620
And um,
he,

28
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,620
um,
was,

29
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:33,610
you know,
he,

30
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,990
first of all,
he's really good looking.

31
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,690
A lot of movie actors aren't good
looking at all when you meet them,

32
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:39,640
you know,
they're much smaller than you would hope

33
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,140
they were,
which is fine.

34
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:43,750
I've nothing against short people but,
but you know,

35
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:46,450
but you're disappointed because they
don't look the same as you want them to

36
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:49,270
look.
And he was like a big strapping,

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,640
you know,
Australian guy.

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,520
Um,
he clearly was really bright,

39
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,430
really creative,
very restless.

40
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,080
Um,
and you know,

41
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:03,910
but charming and charming and
intelligent and clearly having a tough

42
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:07,240
time with the filming.
And one of the things we talked about

43
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:10,240
was insomnia because I suffer from
insomnia as well.

44
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:12,340
So we were sort of trading tips,
so you know,

45
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:15,160
what kind of drugs to take and what kind
of,

46
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:17,410
you know,
techniques we used.

47
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,710
And He,
it kind of hauntingly said,

48
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:21,940
you know,
I've been taking ambien and I took one

49
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:25,630
last night and it didn't work.
So I took another one and then I only

50
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:27,190
slept for an hour.
And he said,

51
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:29,950
you know,
my mind is fizzing with this role.

52
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,330
I cannot get my mind to shut up.
And he didn't seem like he was,

53
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:35,530
you know,
on anything.

54
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:39,220
He just seemed like he was clearly
somebody who was one of those people

55
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:42,340
who,
who get so into his work that he

56
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:47,341
couldn't comment down those voices that
were all excited and fizzy.

57
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,020
And so I felt just so sad at the way he
died because clearly he was talking

58
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:55,390
about that.
And it was clearly was a mistake,

59
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:57,820
I think because he just couldn't get any
sleep.

60
00:02:57,821 --> 00:03:00,040
And I know what that feels like.
Awful.

61
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,040
And so it was just shocking because he
seemed,

62
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,320
he was so full of life and so lovely.

63
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,060
And we talked about his daughter.
He was,

64
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,350
you know,
a little baby daughter.

65
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,680
He just loved her and it was just such a
waste.

66
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:13,120
It was so sad.
And again,

67
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:13,951
you know,
I just had,

68
00:03:13,951 --> 00:03:16,300
would have had no idea.
And he certainly wasn't suicidal.

69
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,600
He was really full of life,
but it was so poignant.

70
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,240
He was living in a beautiful rented
house in London,

71
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,950
and it had,
I think three or four bedrooms.

72
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,830
They took me on a tour,
beautiful place,

73
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,720
and he showed me every single bed had
been,

74
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:29,980
it was all messy,
you know,

75
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:32,140
all the sheets were everywhere.
And he said,

76
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:35,680
cause last night I just couldn't sleep.
So I went from bed to bed hoping I could

77
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:39,520
fall asleep somewhere.
It's just so sad.

78
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,830
I'm just so sad.
And you know,

79
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:44,650
you wonder if someone had really kind of
taken him in hand and said,

80
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,484
you know,
let's,

81
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,520
this movie's hurting your health.
Let's try to work on this.

82
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,350
If he could have been helped,
who knows?

83
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:51,730
You know,
creative people are,

84
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,850
you can't really,
you don't really have answers,

85
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:55,990
do you?
Um,

86
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,330
you can't really know what makes them
tick.

87
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,861
Um,
but it was,

88
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:01,640
it was just,
it was a tragedy really.
