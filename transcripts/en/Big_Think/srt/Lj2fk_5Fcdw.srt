1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,843
Mm,

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,390
so when we think about democracy,
I think there's kind of a real

3
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:15,220
interesting opportunity to think about
what is participatory democracy in the

4
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:20,020
modern connected,
connected world and I think there's all

5
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:24,550
kinds of versions that are much better
than the vote every two years kind of

6
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:27,790
version that we have right now.
For example,

7
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:32,791
does a lovely experiment that said,
what if people got to vote on,

8
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,370
we're five percent of their income tax
goes to.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,170
So you will get the list of all the
things the government does,

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,570
right?
Which is actually already a good thing

11
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:46,810
because people don't know what the
government does.

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,340
We went at some point,
we went to the Chapel Hill Public

13
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,880
Library and we ask people when was the
last time you got benefit from tax

14
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:58,000
payers money?
People couldn't remember when was the

15
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:02,440
last time and they were in a public
library funded by taxpayers money.

16
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,390
So you know,
we don't really understand what the

17
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:06,040
government does,
what,

18
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,770
what taxes go for,
but if you've got a list of all the

19
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:11,620
things the government does and you could
decide five percent,

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,330
you know,
you probably don't want people to

21
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:16,570
allocate all of their income tax because
there's some things that the government

22
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:19,450
needs to worry about,
but doing some kind of marginal

23
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:21,550
contribution and thinking where we want
to be,

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,330
I think would get people to be more
involved,

25
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,080
care more,
look at waste.

26
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,800
I think it will make government officers
a bit more accountable.

27
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,890
So that's one version where I think we
could get participatory democracy to be

28
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:37,900
closer to what we wanted,
wanted to be.

29
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,490
And another,
another kind of direction is to say why

30
00:01:42,491 --> 00:01:45,840
do we need to vote for one person?
Right?

31
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,240
So,
so imagine that we will have a voting

32
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:49,810
procedure.

33
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,810
We would say you could say I want then
Ben really to vote for me on any issues

34
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:01,060
that has to do with education and
health,

35
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,590
but not about a,
I don't know,

36
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:09,190
space exploration and not about a
nuclear activities.

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,630
You can imagine all of society is a
network of people and you can assign

38
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:15,610
your vote,
not just to the representatives,

39
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,710
but you could assign your votes to other
people in society where you could say,

40
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:21,520
you know,
what,

41
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,180
then I trust you or those topics you
could vote for me and I can trust

42
00:02:25,181 --> 00:02:26,260
somebody else.
And so on.

43
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:30,550
So we could,
we could create a network in which we

44
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:35,570
trust different people for different
subtopics and not have this idea that is

45
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:41,900
one person who is representing us is,
is the right person for all,

46
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,730
all topics around.
So,

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,130
um,
so that's one.

48
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,550
The other,
the other,

49
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:53,530
of course,
a big issue.

50
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,330
Um,
I don't know if you saw this,

51
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:58,750
but we,
we need it,

52
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,770
although studies about how people want
society to be designed.

53
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,010
So originally we did it on inequality,
financial inequality,

54
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:10,810
but then we moved to other areas as
well,

55
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,240
but in the area,
financial inequality.

56
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,950
And we ask people,
first of all,

57
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:17,980
what they understand about the
distribution of wealth in the US.

58
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,620
So we said,
imagine if we took all the people in the

59
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:24,310
US from the cruise to the riches.
We broke them into five buckets,

60
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,590
the 20 percent richest,
20 percent less,

61
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,880
less,
less than the poorest,

62
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,980
and we asked you from the 100 percent
wealth total time how much is allocated

63
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,220
right now to each of those five buckets,
and people think that the bottom two

64
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:41,470
buckets,
the bottom 40 percent of Americans own

65
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,370
about nine percent of the wealth when in
fact they own about zero point three,

66
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,440
right?

67
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,310
So the,
the,

68
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,720
this slope is what's called the Gini
Coefficient.

69
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:52,270
The rate of inequality.
People know the rich have.

70
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:54,740
A lot of people don't understand the
American don't understand how much

71
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,830
little the poor,
the poor half.

72
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,360
And then we also ask them what would you
like society to be?

73
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,820
And we use a John Roles.
If you remember John Rawls had this

74
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,560
interesting idea that he said a just
society is a society that if you knew

75
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:14,710
everything about it,
you will be willing to join it in a

76
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:17,470
random place.
But if you're very rich,

77
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:20,680
you might want society that treats the
regionalized and the not so nice.

78
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:22,480
If you're very poor,
you might want the other way around,

79
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:26,740
but if you don't know where you'll be,
you'll be allocated after the fact.

80
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,490
You have to consider all perspective.
And he called this developer ignorance

81
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:33,370
because you choose before you know where
you'll be.

82
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,210
So we described the veil of ignorance to
lots of people and we say,

83
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,280
what kind of society would you like to
create?

84
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,330
And Americans created a society that is
more equal than Sweden,

85
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,240
not perfectly equal.
Nobody wants socialism,

86
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:49,450
but much more equal than than Sweden.
And not only that,

87
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,720
the differences between Republicans and
Democrats were tiny.

88
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,570
So you know,
Republicans want in slightly more

89
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:57,820
inequality.
Democrats won in slightly more equality,

90
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:02,140
but it was small difference compared to
the gap between what we have and what

91
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:05,740
people want.
And that's another way to think about

92
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,140
democracy in the modern world.
So,

93
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,540
you know,
you could say that we could vote on a

94
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:15,541
topic like we could vote on whether we
want Obama's healthcare version.

95
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:17,200
That's,
that's one approach.

96
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,560
But,
but to vote on that as individual,

97
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,960
just way too complex,
this plan is,

98
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:24,340
I mean,
includes so much.

99
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,910
We're not going to be experts on it.
We don't have the time to really read

100
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,390
the whatever,
7,000 pages of this plan.

101
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,500
What what we could do is we could vote
on our principles,

102
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,190
on how we want society to be right,
not about the concrete aspects,

103
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,720
but on what,
what are the guiding principles of

104
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,540
society,
how much we care about equality and how

105
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:53,170
much we care about access to health and
not to vote on something concrete,

106
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:57,230
but to vote on it in terms of what are
the principles we believe in and then it

107
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:02,210
will be the job of the politicians to
take our principles and translate them

108
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:06,080
into policies.
Think about something like investment.

109
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,260
If you go to a an investment
professional to help you,

110
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,870
they don't ask you what stocks you want
to invest in.

111
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,150
That's their job.
What they ask you is what can I firstly

112
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,003
want to take?

113
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,560
How much money do you want to give to
charity?

114
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:22,730
They ask you again of the general
principles about life and then they go

115
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:27,731
ahead and figure how those principles
are going to be played out in the

116
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:30,860
details and.
And that's another kind of interesting

117
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:35,861
version to think about politics,
which you say we as citizens will never

118
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:40,910
have the expertise to truly vote on
everything,

119
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,570
but we understand our own values and we
can say what kind of society do we want

120
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:48,380
to,
to create?

121
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,530
And it will be the job of the
politicians to take these values and

122
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:56,300
translate them into specific instances
and rules.
