1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,170
Yeah,
the inward,

2
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:04,830
the short answer is that my could not
stand the inward,

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,970
had no use for it in the context of its
use,

4
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:12,240
did not matter to her.
Her thing was very simply that if I have

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,270
a vial,
a with a cross bones and skulls on it

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,870
and the word p o l I s o n written on
the bottle.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,440
It's poisoned.
If I take that same poison and pour it

8
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:30,180
into the most beautiful vase of baccarat
crystal ever made,

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,980
it's still a poison for her.
The context of the use of the word and

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,030
didn't matter.
Now this was a generational thing

11
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:40,470
because my was 30 some years older than
I am a or was at the time of us having

12
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:45,240
this conversation and my view of the
inward has a bit more nuanced.

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,403
A,
again,

14
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,980
based upon the generation that I've been
raised in and the music that I listened

15
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:52,230
to in the culture that I've been a part
of.

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,000
So my view is a little bit more liberal
than my view on the inward.

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,240
And so we had this debate for years
about whether or not,

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,730
you know,
the inward was something that ought to

19
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:05,370
be used in any context.
And we never agreed on that.

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,960
There are a number of things we never
agreed on.

21
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:11,360
She asked me when I was in Africa,
what I thought the greatest virtue was

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,820
of all the virtues tab is,
which is the greatest virtue for you.

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,290
And I said,
I think love is the greatest of all the

24
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,990
virtues.
And she said,

25
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:20,730
uh,
I think courage.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,833
I said,
really?

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,793
She said,
yeah.

28
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,620
So for 28 years of our friendship we
debated,

29
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,070
which is the greatest virtue,
love or courage.

30
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,180
Her argument was that it takes courage
to love it.

31
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:34,770
My argument was,
but,

32
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,311
but,
but,

33
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:39,450
but,
but love is courage enacted a,

34
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:41,530
I believe that love is the greatest of
all the virtue.

35
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,070
She thought it was courage and we never,
we never settled that debate.

36
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,550
So there are a number of things that we
would come back to time and time again

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,520
over the course of our relationship.
And we had different opinions.

38
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,270
The point of this is that she allowed me
to interrogate her.

39
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,380
She allowed me to disagree.
She welcomed my opinion.

40
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,960
She wanted to hear what I thought on a
particular issue,

41
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,920
even if she thought I was wrong.
We had debates about the merits of art

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,010
versus entertainment and what makes
something art,

43
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:11,100
what makes something entertainment.
So we had these debates all the time,

44
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:13,350
but it was.
It was such a beautiful relationship

45
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:17,520
where we were always allowed to engage
each other and no matter what the

46
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:20,400
conversation was,
no matter how tense or terse it might've

47
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,360
been about a particular subject matter.
Every conversation always,

48
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,990
always,
always ended on a love note.

49
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,980
She never allowed the conversation to
end without it being on a low note.
