1
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,860
Has changed,
now it's different,

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,960
but it's difficult for me to compare it
with Pushkin's time.

3
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,850
My brother compared to with 60 s of last
century,

4
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,940
a 20th century because in that time
point in Russia wasn't,

5
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,040
I would say itself,
maybe those have,

6
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,880
uh,
your readers,

7
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:47,000
I don't know,
part of the audience who read in

8
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:48,440
Russian,
they remember,

9
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,120
uh,
that this fabulous line by you have to

10
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:57,121
shrink a,
a point in Russia is more than a point

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,970
or the point and either buy it or I see
bullshit.

12
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,870
Uh,
and I remember that generations were

13
00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:09,560
fascinated with these more with this
expression,

14
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,630
but in a sense it's quite silly because
a carrot than Russia more than a

15
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:18,550
character or an Dunno our bread and
Russia more than Brad and star in Russia

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,990
more than the star.
He's so,

17
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:25,991
uh,
today poetry is not more than poetry

18
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:31,211
should be probably first period during
whole Russian history when poetry

19
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,080
occupies its own place.
White models.

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,330
I Degas,
uh,

21
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,520
like in a different culture.
It is.

22
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,810
So
from an point of view,

23
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:52,811
it's normal because point a,
when it appoints,

24
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:58,910
stands on the stadium and the crowds
shouting,

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,150
shout like,
I don't know.

26
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:06,390
They see,
they look at the gladiator.

27
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,270
It's a strange situation because
probably not

28
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,680
was because poetry today shouldn't bears
a

29
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,580
not it's own load.
It shouldn't,

30
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,820
as I said,
it shouldn't substitute

31
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,990
free newspapers,
uh,

32
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,460
as it could be free in general.
It shouldn't.

33
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,410
How to it entertained people.
It shouldn't,

34
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,173
it shouldn't

35
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,060
talk about,
I don't know.

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,090
Uh,
something's not illegal,

37
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:03,010
but something for beaten.
No,

38
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,300
it has to do its own job.
Then lane aim go.

39
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,280
I Dunno,
out of poetry is

40
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,730
to figure out what poetry,
ece in practical way

41
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,870
it is searching of the language always
each,

42
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:36,050
each poetry or in progress.
I mean,

43
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,550
which pull each bullet point is working
on it is part of this general and quite

44
00:03:48,471 --> 00:03:53,471
ambitious a search of the language which
give may be in,

45
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,440
in case of success.
Uh,

46
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:03,450
and this could give,
do they put him herself and to the old

47
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,150
audience possibility to be closer to the
uh,

48
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,400
understanding or suggestion what the
point.

49
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,110
Describe the situation like these
because

50
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,190
okay,

51
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,190
today in today's Russia,
the points are in so

52
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,310
dangerous for those who keep powering
their hands.

53
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,580
So
it is with one hand with the other hand,

54
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,900
those who have
follower

55
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,700
in their hands,
they understand that the raw much more,

56
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,940
many of much more effective ways of
moderation of their relationships with

57
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,020
people and people of art as well.
And it's not so necessary to the

58
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,760
directress refresh represents to redress
people.

59
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,660
So unfortunately I cannot answer
directly to your question as you asked

60
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,490
me.
So I don't think that,

61
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,840
uh,
the poetry will in 10 or 15 years,

62
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:51,841
the poetry will be the only possibility
to see the truth to people know the

63
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,020
difference.
Different institutions and a,

64
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,580
not only poetry

65
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,140
develops everything because.
