1
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:11,190
I consider myself a New Yorker.
I was born in the Great State of New

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,260
Jersey at Perth Amboy,
general hospital,

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,710
but got out of Highland Park,
New Jersey to go to boarding school at

4
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:20,590
age 12.
I knew there was a bigger and better

5
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:22,100
way.
A lot of us from New Jersey,

6
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:23,920
you have a complex about being from New
Jersey,

7
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:26,980
but I have written myself of that
complex because they all have to come

8
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:31,510
from somewhere and sometimes our
somewheres maybe seemed like nowhere,

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,450
but that nowhere gets us to somewhere
and it makes us be better.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,630
So I'm proud to be a jersey boy,

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,850
but you're making an assumption that
Jersey

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,160
symbolizes something and I don't know
what that assumption is.

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,670
Let's just say that
I wanted to make things and be something

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,080
and try to create things.
And where I came from had nothing to do

15
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:01,860
with stopping or starting the.
I just wanted to do something was driven

16
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:02,760
home by my parents.
