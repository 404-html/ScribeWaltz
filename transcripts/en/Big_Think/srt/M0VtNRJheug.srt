1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,303
Legislators.

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,130
Yes,
Percy.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,910
We appreciate that.
We understand that.

4
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:15,290
We know they publish that after you die,
but we,

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,990
we got the memo

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,520
by poets.
He wasn't talking about versify or do

7
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:23,790
you?
He wasn't talking about folk who write

8
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,160
words on a page.
He was talking about all human beings

9
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:30,870
who mustard imagination and empathy to
conceive of an alternative reality given

10
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:33,300
the nightmares,
catastrophic driven realities.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,680
Most of us have to come to terms with
which means to live a life of a certain

12
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:42,681
kind is to be a poet,
an artist of life and artists of living.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,440
One Who through ones deeds and actions
and witness exemplifies and imagination

14
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:54,480
and an empathy that is subversive in
terms of relating to the past which just

15
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:58,830
has four to two and courageous in the
present to pass on to the next

16
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:02,880
generation.
Some wind at their back.

17
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,080
If you're wanting to know what hope he
is.

18
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,970
Just zoom in and August of 1955 within
materials.

19
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:14,210
Mother,
when she's asked to speak before,

20
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:19,211
not just public but the whole world
because the cameras were there from all

21
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:24,200
the various nations and there's her baby
in the coffin with the coffin open.

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,730
They tried to make sure they kept a
coffin closed.

23
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:27,564
She said,
no,

24
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,730
they're going to keep it open.
We just fetched his body from the

25
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,890
Tallahatchie River in Jim Crow,
gut bucket,

26
00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:38,090
Mississippi Keel by cowardly hateful
American terrorists,

27
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,350
white supremacists.

28
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,060
We going to keep it open.
This is my only baby.

29
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,360
What you got to say Mamie till to the
world.

30
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,630
I'm not speaking on behalf of myself.
She says,

31
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:51,970
I'm not speaking on behalf of black
people are America.

32
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,370
I'm speaking on behalf of the bests of
the humans

33
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,680
bcs,
which is what I don't have a minute to

34
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:01,440
hate.
I will pursue justice for the rest of my

35
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:04,650
life.
That's been a hope.

36
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,570
It's an echo,
that magnificent moment and Ryan home

37
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,090
neighbors,
1932 classic more men in the moral

38
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:16,590
society where Ryan Hall says any
justice.

39
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:21,591
There's only justice soon degenerate
into something less than justice.

40
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,050
Justice must be rescued by something
grander and deeper than justice.

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,090
Mainly love,
love,

42
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,160
justice,
not identical,

43
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,640
but in the visible.
When Martin says,

44
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:39,640
justice is what love looks like in
public,

45
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,050
he's talking about it in the legacy of
Jerusalem,

46
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,350
not the legacy of Athens for Plato.
Justice as a norm

47
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,120
to giving and having ones do,
but an Amos justice is a force,

48
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,360
is a major force.
It's an answer to the question of Walter

49
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,280
Hawkins and his song,
what is this?

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,120
How do I count for this fire I have
inside of me that want to give me any

51
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:17,314
piece?

52
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,860
I've got to somehow get it out and if I
don't do something to rock,

53
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:26,440
so going to cry out,
that's as substantial.

54
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,790
I wouldn't even call it spiritual
because we know religious folk have no

55
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:35,710
monopoly on it.
Given the history of religious

56
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:38,440
institutions,
accommodating themselves to the most

57
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,540
vicious phones have beastiality and
atrocity be against our Jewish brothers

58
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,280
and sisters in the history of
Christianity.

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,570
It could be against Muslims,
it can be against everything because

60
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,980
women,
I'm gazing levels of black folk or

61
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:52,690
whatever.
Thank God for the history of the

62
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:57,691
heretics and the blast famous.
That's my crowd.

63
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,080
Look at the history of communism.
My God,

64
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:07,140
every self conscious Marxists finds him
or herself usually having to leave the

65
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:11,920
communist party in order to be true to
the best of Karl Marx.

66
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,700
Why?
Because of the ossification and a pet to

67
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:18,280
vacation of institutions in that way.

68
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,060
Hope is that substantial.
Keep coming back to that point.

69
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,730
And the issue of integrity that the boys
raised is quintessential.

70
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,290
And of course we live in an age of what?
Cupidity love of money.

71
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,230
I didn't say stupidity.
That's too easy.

72
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,680
Even though that's part of the problem,
but it's cupidity

73
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,080
cause it wouldn't be a Donald Trump if
it wasn't for Wall Street corporate.

74
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:51,730
He leads the Republican Party that was
so complicitness and willing to adjust

75
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:55,360
themselves to it or even a democratic
part of this too.

76
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,230
Milk,
toast and acts like they want to be part

77
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:02,231
of the resistance but usually have to be
brought in kicking and screaming because

78
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:04,180
the Deimos wake up and just hit the
streets.

79
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,730
The way the system is did the day after
the inauguration night,

80
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:12,010
it hit hit the airports the way our
precious brothers and sisters in

81
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:17,011
solidarity with and following,
so call undocumented brothers and

82
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:22,351
sisters.
It's all those little ones we've been in

83
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,000
the vanguard,
those are the poets,

84
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,530
the artists,
the van guard of the species.

85
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,490
Integrity over against cupidity and
venality and the saddest feature of our

86
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:43,180
present moment and that's why you all
were so visionary because you all came

87
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:46,570
up with this day and age of Obama.
I see for a lot of people,

88
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:49,420
they didn't need to talk about hope.
I know Obama because Obama has already

89
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:51,100
provided in the hope.
Of course.

90
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,060
I didn't get that memo.

91
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,590
That's another lecture.
We're not going to get into that

92
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:57,900
tonight.
No,

93
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,180
no.
Well,

94
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,830
I'm suspicious of anybody tagged the
wall of speak military industrial

95
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:07,070
complex assassinating American citizens
without accountability.

96
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,310
I'm critical of antibody antibody,
the top 1% getting 95% of the income

97
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,940
growth and 94% of the job that you brag
about a short term contemporary,

98
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,320
temporary,
precarious jobs that somehow you're

99
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:27,010
going to talk about the low unemployment
rate.

100
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,850
Why don't you just take a look at these
brushes folk in these communities

101
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:34,090
dealing with these two or three jobs,
trying to put it all together.

102
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,820
Start with the university with adjunct
professors.

103
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,260
Go Brag to me about how wonderful the
status quo is and therefore death.

104
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,690
Do you hope,
but that's another lecture.

105
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,070
My point is this.

106
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,273
Yeah.

107
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,730
My point is this,
that everybody's for sale.

108
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,790
Okay.

109
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:01,790
Everything is for sale.
Your glucose was right.

110
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,620
Pervasive,
ubiquitous commodification tied to

111
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,320
militarization in our relations with one
another and the relations with police

112
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:18,980
and local citizens,
relation of CIA,

113
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,990
State Department and Pentagon to Yemen
and Pakistan and Afghanistan and in

114
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:30,141
relation to undermine democratic regimes
in Honduras in relation to Libya in

115
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,190
relation to the West Bank under Israeli
occupation in relation to poor doers,

116
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,230
folk inside of Israel,
given the increasing wealth inequality

117
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:47,231
within Israel itself,
commodification,

118
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,690
militarization.
And then of course nigger residx.

119
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,500
What is Nigga realization?
The attempt to make sure the dose slash

120
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:03,560
don't call everyday.
People are so scared and intimidated and

121
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:08,561
afraid and feeling so hopeless and
helpless that they'll never straighten

122
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:13,220
their backs up.
Walking around feeling is there.

123
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,490
They can't make a difference.
The voices don't matter.

124
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:23,230
You can hear by the Martin Luther King,
same from the grave it time ordinary

125
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,380
people's straighten their backs up to
going somewhere cause fuck k ride your

126
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:32,370
back unless it bent.
And that's an echo of the and Walden

127
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,960
when he talks about the sleep walkers
and it has the sleep,

128
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,090
the focal walking on their backs and the
when they wake up and stay woke.

129
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:43,160
And that just they walked away.
Our presses,

130
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:44,090
young folk talk about it.

131
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,520
Black lives matter,
but stay four to five as you awoke.

132
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,350
Okay.

133
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,350
Then the folk who are walking on your
back find sales in situations that's

134
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:58,950
called revolution

135
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,820
revolution.
Mine Revolution and values revolution

136
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:07,821
and priority is a transformation of self
and community and society,

137
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,890
and there is no transformation

138
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,930
without positive transformation,
without this dialect to go into play of

139
00:09:21,891 --> 00:09:26,891
love as a form of death from which hope
emerges in the form of action.

140
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,043
Hmm.

141
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:36,920
[inaudible].
