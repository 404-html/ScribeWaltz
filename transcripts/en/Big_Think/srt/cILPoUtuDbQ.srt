1
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,840
Begin by talking about the book in
Florence,

2
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,970
which resulted from my two and a half
year program of research into the

3
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:24,380
training programs of all of the
different influence professions to see

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,590
what they do to get us to say yes.
I was surprised by one thing that I

5
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,550
encountered in all of these programs.
There were only six universal

6
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:39,080
principles.
Now there were hundreds,

7
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:44,030
maybe thousands of individual tactics,
but only six universal principles of

8
00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:49,031
influence that seemed to capture the
great majority of what all of these

9
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:53,090
individuals were doing.
Reciprocity,

10
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,920
the desire to have all of us to give
back to someone who has given to us.

11
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,700
So if an individual gives us something,
a free sample,

12
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:05,150
for example,
we feel obligated to at least listen to

13
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:08,240
what they have to say at the,
at the supermarket,

14
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:10,820
for example,
that little lady with the cubes of

15
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,560
cheese and meat.

16
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,890
After you've eaten one of those,
it's very hard to just give her back the

17
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:17,230
toothpick.
Yeah.

18
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,430
You feel like you've abs obligated to
buy.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,230
Reciprocity is one another is scarcity.
The desire to have those things you can

20
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:27,680
have less of.
So things that are scarce,

21
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,840
rare,
dwindling in availability.

22
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,620
So one of the things that,
uh,

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,830
many,
uh,

24
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,520
organizations will do is to inform us of
how a rare,

25
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,200
how uncommon their features are.
Uh,

26
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,580
another principle is commitment and
consistency.

27
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,390
The desire to be consistent with what
we've already said or done,

28
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,573
uh,
to,

29
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,980
to be congruent with our internal values
and,

30
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,920
and what we've said that we're going to
do.

31
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,100
So for example,
one study showed that if you call people

32
00:01:58,101 --> 00:01:59,350
on the phone,
uh,

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,870
uh,
registered voters and ask them if they

34
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:07,871
will vote in the upcoming election,
they of course say yes and they now vote

35
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:14,240
significantly more often than if they
didn't receive that phone call.

36
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,760
Getting them to commit to that sort of
thing.

37
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,050
Another principle is consensus or what
we call social proof.

38
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,280
The idea that people want to follow the
lead of similar others,

39
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,520
people just like them.
We've done a study,

40
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,920
for example,
in hotels,

41
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,630
I don't know how much you travel,
but,

42
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,690
uh,
when I do in 70% of the hotels where I

43
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:37,880
stay,
there's a little laminated card asking

44
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:39,740
me to reuse my towels.
And linen.

45
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,070
We put different kinds of cards in rooms
to see what we could say on the car.

46
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:49,130
That would most increased the likelihood
that people would say yes.

47
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,150
What hotels typically say is do this for
the environment,

48
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,520
do this for future generations or
cooperate with us toward this common

49
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:03,521
cause.
We added a different sign based on the

50
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:08,170
principle of consensus that people want
to do what everybody else is doing.

51
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,920
It said the majority of guests who stay
at our hotel do recycle their towels at

52
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,250
least once.
That was absolutely true and it

53
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,310
increased compliance by 28% the
interesting thing is that was a

54
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:30,061
completely costless message and it's
never ever been used in any hotel in any

55
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:37,981
city that I've visited and the reason is
those managers don't know what the

56
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:43,390
research says.
One of the hopes in these books that

57
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:48,391
I've been publishing on the influence
process is to allow people outside of

58
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:53,020
the academic community,
the non researchers who in any

59
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:58,021
meaningful way have paid for this
research with their tax dollars to learn

60
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,770
what we found out about them with their
money.

61
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:08,110
They're entitled to know what we found
out about them with their money.

62
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,450
And so that's one of the purposes of the
book,

63
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:15,451
to be sure that we present this
information to the wider public besides

64
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:19,600
just the academic community in which the
work was done.

65
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,750
We undertook the publication of the yes
book as a way to change the perception

66
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:33,340
of persuasion as just an art.
Something that people are born with,

67
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:38,341
with some sort of Predator natural gift
for saying the right thing at exactly

68
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:42,700
the right time.
And there are artisans of the persuasion

69
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:44,170
process,
no question about it,

70
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,650
but it turns out persuasion is also a
science for over a half a century.

71
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:55,180
Now researchers in various kinds of
situations,

72
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:57,720
mostly psychologists,
communication professionals,

73
00:04:57,721 --> 00:04:59,380
sometimes marketing,
uh,

74
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:04,381
professors in business schools have been
studying how you can say something in

75
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:09,751
one particular way that will
significantly increase the likelihood of

76
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,770
ascent to that thing and have been
checking their theories and their

77
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:19,771
hypotheses in scientific experiments
that allow us lessons that we can

78
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:25,891
provide to the larger community beyond
the scientific establishment of how you

79
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:31,861
can be more effective and how you can be
confident that you will be more

80
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:35,350
effective because it's grounded in true
science,

81
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,710
not just hunches and speculations of
people who,

82
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,320
uh,
want to talk to you about this process.

83
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,330
What I'm going to claim about the
principles that we talk about is that

84
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:53,890
they are universals of influence.
There are so central to the human

85
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:57,740
condition,
so fundamental to the way we work as

86
00:05:57,741 --> 00:06:02,120
citizens of modern society,
that you will be able to use them

87
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:06,650
successfully or they can be used
successfully in all kinds of domains

88
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,140
with your friends,
with your neighbors,

89
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,690
with your coworkers,
with your boss,

90
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,950
even with that most resistant of all
audiences,

91
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,460
your children.
I'll guarantee that these principles are

92
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:24,020
so fundamental there,
so psychologically central that they

93
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:29,150
strum strings that are inside all of us
and that we try to resonate with in

94
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:32,390
order to behave correctly.

95
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,160
The difference between influence and
manipulation is an important and

96
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:44,090
profound one like dynamite.
These principles,

97
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:47,930
these tactics,
these lessons can be used for good or

98
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:52,220
ill.
The difference is the extent to which

99
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:57,221
they are employed
by someone who's taking a detective's

100
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:03,701
approach to the influence process rather
than a smuggler's approach.

101
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:09,070
A smuggler imports one or another of
these principles into a situation where

102
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:12,710
it doesn't naturally resist exist.
For example,

103
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,630
excuse me.
Let's say for example that we use the

104
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:22,631
principle of authority.
We can move people in our direction by

105
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,590
claiming to be an expert on some topic
that we're talking about.

106
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,000
And if they believe us,
it's very human for them to want to take

107
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:36,950
the shortcut route and follow what a
legitimately constituted expert says.

108
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,670
If we're not in authority,
we have exploited this process to bring

109
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:48,020
people in and we've manipulated them and
their interests and their outcomes.

110
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,140
Uh,
there's a short term success,

111
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,150
uh,
consequence of that.

112
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,300
People do say yes to us,
there's a longterm disastrous

113
00:07:56,301 --> 00:08:00,530
consequences is that they don't want to
continue to deal with us if we fool them

114
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,110
into yes.
On the other hand,

115
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:08,210
if we're a detective of influence and we
go into a situation where we recognize

116
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:13,211
that we are genuinely in authority,
all we have to do is raise that to the

117
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:18,491
surface and significantly increase the
likelihood that people will be counseled

118
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:23,570
correctly into a good choice to make.
So for example,

119
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,810
we did a study with a hospital,
um,

120
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,270
uh,
uh,

121
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,180
physical therapists.
We just asked them to put on the wall of

122
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:35,270
the physical therapy lab.
All of their credentials,

123
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,390
all of their diplomas,
all of their awards and compliance with

124
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,300
their,
um,

125
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,870
with their exercise regimens went up 30%
immediately.

126
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,040
Not because it's not so surprising that
people want to follow the lead of

127
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,680
legitimate authority.
The interesting thing is that that below

128
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:58,590
the surface,
that genuine authority,

129
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,680
all it had to be,
all there had to be done was that

130
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,570
somebody like a detective Saul was there
and brought it to the surface.

131
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,990
So it would be available to people,
uh,

132
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,530
to base their decisions on.

133
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,180
Yeah,
no,

134
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,640
it's a,
it's a great question because it gets

135
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,800
back to the,
uh,

136
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,670
to the question of ethics again,
which is

137
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,070
if somebody is trying to influence me
and I've read my book,

138
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,410
um,
and I know that they're trying,

139
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,270
I should not be automatically resistant
to that.

140
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,570
I should only be resistant to the person
who's trying to manipulate me into yes,

141
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,140
by claiming to be an authority when he
or she isn't.

142
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,890
I do want to follow the person who's the
genuine authority.

143
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:50,460
For example,
I do want to follow the person who gives

144
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:55,461
me true information that what they are
rec recommending is consistent with an

145
00:09:56,161 --> 00:10:00,660
existing commitment that I've already
made a priority that I have in my life.

146
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,590
Or I do want to,
uh,

147
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,740
be,
uh,

148
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,900
uh,
vulnerable to the appeals of someone who

149
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:11,901
tells me about a genuinely unique or
dwindling availability that has value to

150
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:14,010
me.

151
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,780
All of those things are,
are influenced dimensions along which I

152
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:23,520
want to move,
except when they're counterfeited.

153
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,670
So the key is if I've read about
influence and I know about it,

154
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,350
I should no longer be simply alert to
the fact that somebody is trying to

155
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:38,970
influence me.
It's a more subtle differentiation.

156
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,860
I need to be alert to the person who's
trying to influence me with genuine

157
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:48,861
information about the uh,
the factors that steer me correctly

158
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,280
versus somebody who's trying to
fabricate that information

159
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,880
for yes,
there are such features.

160
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:02,010
So for example,
um,

161
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,300
one of the principles of influence we
talk about is liking people prefer to

162
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:10,410
say yes to those they know and like,
and one of the factors that causes us to

163
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:14,700
like somebody else is how similar we
feel to that person.

164
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:20,030
So the individual who on a youtube video
comes across as,

165
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,300
as every person as just like the
audience to whom he or she is speaking,

166
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,340
we'll get that liking,
we'll get the rapport,

167
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:34,170
we'll get the focus of attention and
will make the information more likely to

168
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:35,730
be considered.

169
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,480
The same thing goes with the authority
principle that we've talked about.

170
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,630
The extent to which you can appear more
authoritative,

171
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,360
more credible,
more knowledgeable,

172
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,220
and you can do that.
For example,

173
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,310
by doing something as simple as speaking
slightly more

174
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,140
then normal,
we assign greater credibility and

175
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:04,141
knowledge and confidence to people who
speak slightly more rapidly than normal.

176
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,670
If you speak too quickly,
then you look like,

177
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,450
uh,
some,

178
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,350
some,
uh,

179
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,780
uh,
salesperson who's trying to pull the

180
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:16,930
wool over their eyes,
but slightly more rapidly than normal.

181
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,980
You get a sense this person knows what
he or she is talking about and you're

182
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:23,020
more willing to take that information
in.

183
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,200
I'm not sure if you were your,
your viewers would recall,

184
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:34,201
but there is a public service
announcement that was run back in the

185
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,550
70s and eighties called the [inaudible]
iron eyes,

186
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,140
cody spot.
That is the,

187
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,700
is reputed to be the single most
effective public service announcement

188
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,990
about the environment that has ever been
sent to the American public.

189
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,480
It showed a picture of a very stately
buckskin clad,

190
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,300
a native American paddling his canoe up
a river that,

191
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,403
that,
uh,

192
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,120
floated with various kinds of pollution.
He came to the side of the river.

193
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:08,170
The bank was covered with pollution.
He came to the side of a road also

194
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,250
littered.
A car went by and through garbage out

195
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:15,490
the window.
It's fast food bag at his feet.

196
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,310
It's splattered.
The camera panned up and you saw a tear

197
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,030
running down his face.
Very powerful message,

198
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,930
don't litter.
We have evidence that that message not

199
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:36,391
only maybe less than optimal,
it may actually be damaging to the goals

200
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:43,350
of the creators of that ad because the
sub text message was everybody's

201
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,163
littering.

202
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,040
Everybody does this and that is a more
primitive message then this native

203
00:13:57,551 --> 00:14:00,310
American actor doesn't want you to
later.

204
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,270
Right,
and we've done studies to show that if

205
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,720
somebody watches while someone else
litters into an already littered

206
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,570
environment,
just as what happened in that iron eyes,

207
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:18,010
cody spot,
it significantly increases the

208
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:20,710
likelihood that observers will later
there.

209
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,970
The thing you can do to decrease
littering is to have someone litter into

210
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:32,230
a pristine environment that causes
people to say,

211
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:35,830
wait a minute,
you are a northern breaker.

212
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,490
I don't want to be like you.
And they see,

213
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:44,580
they see significantly suppress their
tendency to litter as a consequence of

214
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:46,940
seeing somebody later into a cleaning.
