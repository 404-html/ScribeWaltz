1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,210
Maybe me more than

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,370
I picked it.
Um,

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,500
I was conditioned that an early age to
appreciate nature photography through my

4
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:20,350
grandfather who's a,
he was Irish and,

5
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:23,760
um,
he left Ireland in the 1920s and moved

6
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:28,150
to India and then the,
he was a doctor and,

7
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:30,340
um,
and in the early part of his life,

8
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:33,970
he was engaged in safaris and whatnot,
which is not that glorious,

9
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:36,080
uh,
looking back in retrospect because he

10
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:39,700
shot tigers and whatnot.
But in the twenties and thirties,

11
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:42,520
you know,
I suppose it had a different type of a

12
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:44,980
social imprint as we might examine
today.

13
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:47,650
But in his midlife,
he traded has a,

14
00:00:47,651 --> 00:00:51,760
is gone for a camera.
And so I continued doing his safaris and

15
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:54,850
expeditions both in India and then later
on in,

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,710
in Africa and Botswana and Tanzania and
Namibia and,

17
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:00,670
uh,
and settled.

18
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:01,690
He lived in,
um,

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,030
in Swaziland,
just a north or South Africa.

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,460
So his,
um,

21
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,970
his body of,
uh,

22
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,030
photography work was,
um,

23
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,640
uh,
impressed upon me at an early age

24
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,730
through a slideshows.

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,730
And I sat through many slideshows are
watching elephants and giraffes and

26
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:21,850
whatnot.
So that was my sort of early affinity

27
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:22,510
to,
uh,

28
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,890
to landscape photography.
And I started taking pictures in South

29
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,890
Africa myself when I was about 12,
um,

30
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,810
on,
um,

31
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,240
you know,
in Safaris and,

32
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:33,850
and whatnot.
And,

33
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:36,460
uh,
and then it just progressed.

34
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:40,140
And I always somehow was picked to,
uh,

35
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,200
to shoot.
And,

36
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,510
um,
and I translated that into a career in

37
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,670
advertising where I did a lot of
directing,

38
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:48,430
actually all of commercials and music
videos.

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,360
And then,
um,

40
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,070
I decided to focus more specifically on
photography and get out of,

41
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,100
of advertising.
I wasn't entirely comfortable,

42
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,761
uh,
eventually,

43
00:01:57,761 --> 00:02:00,080
as I developed as an advocate,
uh,

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,580
with promoting messages of consumerism.
So I,

45
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:06,760
uh,
I settled on portrait photography for,

46
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,190
um,
a career earning,

47
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,050
um,
uh,

48
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,070
potential.
And then,

49
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:13,300
um,
and then of course,

50
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,950
I followed with my,
uh,

51
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,843
my advocacy

52
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,900
American landscape.
