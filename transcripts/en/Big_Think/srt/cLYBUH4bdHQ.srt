1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,590
In respect of many of these
technological projects of mortality,

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,430
what survives is not the person who
wants lived

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,013
in,
um,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,540
a coach wiles version as I understand
it.

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,460
Uh,
what is proposed is that elements of the

6
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:21,120
conscious mind,
the conscious self of the people

7
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:26,121
concerned are somehow a programmed
computed and then projected into

8
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:32,390
cyberspace where that self aware,
um,

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,430
mind can create a variety of bodies for
itself in a virtual environment.

10
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:42,870
So rather than having the one frail
aging vulnerable,

11
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,160
a body that we,
each of us have to start with,

12
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,740
uh,
people can have a whole variety of

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,830
different bodies,
different genders when they get bored

14
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:55,500
with them or want to change them for
other reasons,

15
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:58,220
they can have as many as they want.
My objection is that what would have,

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,120
I would not be the person because first
of all,

17
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:03,990
it would only be the parts of the person
which are conscious and can be

18
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:04,824
programmed.

19
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,920
And my view is that,
um,

20
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,790
the larger part of each of us and a
large part of where our creativity,

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,390
uh,
in,

22
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,670
in our lives,
comes from both artistic and

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,640
intellectual.
Creativity is not conscious.

24
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:22,260
It's in a,
it's,

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,340
it's in part of ourselves,
which is not accessible to conscious

26
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:31,300
awareness.
So if I'm a,

27
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,970
um,
my conscious life,

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,080
my conscious intellectual life is
somehow had coded and encrypted and then

29
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:42,081
projected into a virtual afterlife,
what the will be out there will be a

30
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,080
sort of thinned out cartoon of the
person,

31
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,830
a thinned out image of the,
of the whole person I once was,

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,610
and I'm not interested in that kind of
immortality.

33
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:56,260
I wouldn't accept it if I were offered,
offered it.

34
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,370
Um,
I might very well except an extension of

35
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:04,260
long get of healthy longevity of the
kind that Aubrey degrade talks about.

36
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,230
Um,
we're already living longer and

37
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:10,350
healthier than many previous human
generations did.

38
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:12,360
I see nothing inherently wrong with
that,

39
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,950
but indefinite longevity is not
immortality and it's not the kind of

40
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:21,951
radical freedom from bodily frailty that
future as such as Kurtzweil want.
