1
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,870
I began to write this book on November
third,

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:06,280
2004.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,760
I had come back to the states to give a
series of lectures on my last book,

4
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:17,560
which is on the subject of evil,
and I timed those lectures to coincide

5
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:19,990
with what I thought would be the
celebration of the end of the Bush

6
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:22,510
administration,
as you can imagine,

7
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:26,530
on November third,
2004 as I sat there drinking for double

8
00:00:26,531 --> 00:00:29,590
Espressos,
a trying to get myself off the floor

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,280
enough to talk about evil.
I felt particularly disturbed about the

10
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:40,480
fact that people claimed they had voted
against the Democrats because the

11
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:44,290
Democrats were lacking in moral clarity
or they didn't have moral values.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,990
I think particularly looked at from
abroad.

13
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:50,230
Although most Americans now see it that
way.

14
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,460
And administration,
that's reinstituted torture lied its way

15
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:59,290
into a war for which it can't even
provide for the soldiers who are losing

16
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:02,680
limbs and mental health center.
Uh,

17
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,710
it's hard to define as being morally
clear or having strong moral values.

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,830
But it seemed to me that I had two
choices.

19
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:14,050
One was to say,
okay,

20
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:17,650
all the people who voted that way have
simply been bamboozled by talk about

21
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:20,050
values and their real interests lie
elsewhere,

22
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:25,290
or I could examine what the faults on my
own progressive side war and to say what

23
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:33,100
have we been doing wrong,
and I think that it's true that secular

24
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:36,970
progressives in particular have had
trouble with moral language.

25
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:42,210
So I decided the thing that I could best
or most helpfully do really for my

26
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:47,200
country as somebody was philosophical
skills,

27
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,700
was to write a book reclaiming more
language for progressive

28
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,720
purposes.
A number of ways.

29
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,350
After the sixties,

30
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,660
the left was properly concerned.
I think that we had been to theoretical

31
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:12,190
ideological and that it was part of the
reason why the left had failed in the

32
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,410
United States was that we hadn't been
pragmatic enough and all of that was

33
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:22,560
true,
but the direction that the left turned

34
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:26,730
in was I think fatal.
Instead of talking about ideas,

35
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,970
they talked about interests and what you
had then was an interest based politics

36
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,180
which took what might have been the
greatest achievement of the civil rights

37
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:42,180
movement.
Which was to convince many people,

38
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:46,080
and I grew up in Atlanta,
I was a child in the middle of the civil

39
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,910
rights movement.
So it's a big part of my,

40
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,470
um,
my background is the belief that good

41
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:57,471
people have whatever background need to
stand up together for a universal rights

42
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,840
because there was an old song that says,
all men are slaves to our brothers are

43
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:05,674
free.

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,700
That's what I grew up believing.
All of that.

45
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,330
I'm also symbolized by many,
or at least civil rights leader.

46
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,950
A leader is Bob Moses who said,
this is not about black versus white

47
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:20,590
people.
It's about rational versus irrational

48
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:23,860
people.
Instead of that spirit which animated

49
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:28,630
the early civil rights movement,
people began to think that politics was

50
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:31,240
about interest groups.
It was about black rights.

51
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:33,070
It was about women's rights.
It was about gay rights.

52
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:38,071
It was about,
as you see the mess that we are in now.

53
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,900
And I think it was a terrible mistake
because it took us back to the sort of

54
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:48,901
tribal politics that are actually pre
socratic were what everybody believes

55
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:54,490
is.
The bottom line is my group wants power

56
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:58,300
over your group.
This is not in the end,

57
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,680
a direction that can mobilize or inspire
anyone,

58
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:04,840
but it's the direction that the left
Wenton,

59
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,770
the right on the other hand went off to
build think tanks and it was very

60
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:09,604
interesting.

61
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,970
You had all kinds of a businessman
funding people to read Plato and

62
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,970
Aristotle.
Uh,

63
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,710
it's quite extraordinary that you had an
anti intellectual movement on the left

64
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,600
and an intellectual turn on the right
and they had a,

65
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,660
they were thinking in long terms and
they took over again.

66
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,480
That's a simplified view of what I think
happened,

67
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:40,270
but it's a piece of what I think went
wrong.

68
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,770
When you have conservatives,
and this is an international question by

69
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:46,360
the way,
it's not simply a national question.

70
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:47,710
You see the same thing happening in
Europe.

71
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,870
Conservatives are using the language of
universal values that the left is no

72
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:55,620
longer able to,
uh,

73
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,910
to the use without these horrible
quotation marks,

74
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:04,750
scare quotes.
I think another factor played a huge

75
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:07,600
role,
which is in 1989,

76
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,390
even those of us who hadn't been
communists and who had been

77
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,330
distinguishing for a long time between
what we call a real existing socialism,

78
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:20,320
which was not socialism as one wanted it
to be,

79
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,560
I think the collapse of the Soviet Union
made painfully clear to people who had

80
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:31,120
been wanting to avoid that,
that things in real existing socialism

81
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:36,121
were even worse than we had suspected so
that it was easy to take the line.

82
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,310
Many people who shared ideals that we
shared and had been willing to fight and

83
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:49,480
die for them had actually wound up
committing genuine crimes,

84
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,130
and if that's the outcome of people who
are willing to live and die for ideas,

85
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:56,620
maybe the world will be better off if we
did nothing.

86
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,230
I think it was understandable
conclusion,

87
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:03,440
not a correct conclusion.
I think we're still reeling from that

88
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:05,240
conclusion.
We're now talking about it.

89
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,640
You know,
this is a 18 years ago.

90
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:12,440
It's not very long that we've had to
rethink things were still in the process

91
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:15,530
of rethinking and I'm hoping to
contribute to that.
