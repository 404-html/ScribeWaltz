1
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,970
It's embarrassing,
it's a,

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,320
you know,
whether or not my son does well on the

3
00:00:15,321 --> 00:00:20,321
baseball team and whether or not he is
able to hit,

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,080
um,
what worries me at night about the

5
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:26,930
world.
I don't know.

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,430
I don't sleep much,
so I spent a lot of time,

7
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,920
you know,
on line.

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,480
I'm reading news in the middle of the
night.

9
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,780
Um,
lately actually not so much seems,

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,150
seems very worrying for me.
Strangely.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,030
It seems like a few years ago it was
much worse.

12
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,110
Uh,
maybe that was a,

13
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,010
you know,
now to be honest,

14
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,310
if you look@CNN.com,
you know,

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,920
nothing ever happened as far as I can
tell.

16
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,083
Uh,

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,680
so,
but you know,

18
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:05,470
there's,
there's more insidious things happening

19
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:07,300
with your scary,
I guess.

20
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:10,900
Um,
I don't stay up at night worrying about

21
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:13,210
global warming even though I think it's
a huge problem.

22
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:14,963
Um,

23
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,610
you know,
this is embarrassing.

24
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:23,611
I stay up at night worrying about
worrying about local stuff.

25
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,010
Yeah.
I'm sorry,

26
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,890
I should have something really deep to
say about that.
