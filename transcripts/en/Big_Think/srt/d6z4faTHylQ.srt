1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,410
Well,
I actually am the founder of the founder

2
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,800
is a guy named Steve Hindi.
Uh,

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,820
who founded it with his,
uh,

4
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:16,260
his neighbor,
Tom Potter.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,440
And Steve had been a reporter in the
Middle East.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,551
Uh,
you know,

7
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:24,140
he knew all the major players over there
from Yasser Arafat too,

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,243
you know,
uh,

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,000
uh,
all the people that,

10
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:29,100
that,
that really were the main people on the

11
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:31,530
stage back in the seventies and
eighties.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,560
And when he worked over in the Middle
East,

13
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:37,140
they often,
the journalists would make their own

14
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:40,260
beer when they were in station places
that didn't allow alcohol.

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,010
So through that he fell in love with
brewing,

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,840
came back to the United States and was
brewing with his neighbor who was a

17
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:52,650
banker and it was a commercial bank loan
officer and they got together and

18
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:55,650
started Brooklyn brewery in 1988.
Uh,

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,680
I came on in 1994 to build the new
brewery in Brooklyn and to expand from

20
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:06,471
the tube or beers that they had back
then to the 15 or 16 and a year that we

21
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:09,300
create right now.
Um,

22
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:10,110
so,
uh,

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,880
I've been with the brewery for 14 years
now.

24
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,700
No,
they're all kind of like,

25
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:19,450
you know,
my,

26
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,440
my children,
you know,

27
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:21,191
you guys like,
oh,

28
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:22,890
which is the,
which is your favorite child.

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,620
Um,
now some days you might actually have an

30
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:28,320
answer for that question and that would
be true,

31
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,380
I think of the beers as well.
But if you asked me in the middle of

32
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,640
winter,
you're going to get a completely

33
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:35,250
different answer than you're going to
get on a hot day in summer.

34
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,470
If you asked me on a boat,
you'll get a different answer than you

35
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:39,690
get in my house.
It really depends on what I'm having for

36
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:40,524
dinner.
So,

37
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,200
um,
I think of the beers as all having their

38
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:47,360
particular talents and it's just about
like what mood I man at any particular

39
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:52,361
time
voted to me more likely we fear or a

40
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:58,050
Pilsner,
cause I'm probably going to be having a

41
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,440
number of them.
I don't want anything,

42
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,590
uh,
you know,

43
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,470
two heavy.
Um,

44
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,161
but,
uh,

45
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:03,710
and I,
and I,

46
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,800
I like,
I like the sharp,

47
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,050
bitter flavor of,
uh,

48
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,880
of the pills and there,
so I'm probably gonna lean in that

49
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:13,881
direction.
Well,

50
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:18,440
it depends on before or after dinner,
before dinner or with dinner.

51
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:21,470
It's Brown Ale was after dinner,
then it's going to be our black

52
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:22,304
chocolates out.

53
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:27,830
Wow.

54
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,170
In my case,
it'll be a rooftop in Brooklyn.

55
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,790
Um,
but,

56
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,170
uh,
and I do have 800,

57
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:36,970
a big 800 square foot roof and a these
days it's totally been our,

58
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:38,090
uh,
Brooklyn local one,

59
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,590
which is,
uh,

60
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,311
uh,
you know,

61
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:42,470
the one that we're doing the bottle re
fermentation on,

62
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,820
you know,
it's 9%.

63
00:02:43,821 --> 00:02:46,250
So you have to be careful about the
stairs as you go back down from the

64
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:47,210
roof.
But,

65
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:47,911
uh,
you know,

66
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:49,630
we,
we've been having a very good time with

67
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:50,140
that,
uh,

68
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,973
in the last year

69
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,370
Brooklyn lager because that's probably

70
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,121
why,
uh,

71
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:02,380
you know,
at least for us,

72
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:02,801
you know,
that's,

73
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:04,990
that's our,
that's our flagship.

74
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,310
Uh,
that's our flagship beer.

75
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,950
It's the beer that we're,
we're probably best known for.

76
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,540
And a,
and thankfully,

77
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,210
almost anywhere you go,
especially downtown in New York City,

78
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:15,460
you're going to see a Brooklyn lager.
And,

79
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,300
uh,
you know,

80
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:16,991
and,
uh,

81
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:17,860
we,
we still love it.

82
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:18,040
I think

83
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,600
it's a great beer.
