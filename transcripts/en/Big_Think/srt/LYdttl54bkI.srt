1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,230
It played over to come back,
uh,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,790
today I think he would have a lot to say
about so many things,

3
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:08,280
but,
but crowd sourcing would be of great

4
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:13,281
interest to him.
I take plato to the Google plex and he's

5
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:17,370
very,
very interested in our technology and,

6
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:17,731
uh,
that,

7
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:20,840
that would appeal to him very much.
Um,

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,900
but he gets into a conversation at the
Google plex with a software engineer on

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:32,670
a crowdsourcing and could crowdsourcing
answer the kind of ethical questions

10
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:37,260
that he first raised.
And,

11
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,720
um,
he is,

12
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:42,450
he's quite interested in this idea,
but he's very,

13
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,850
uh,
he's very down.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,720
He's very much against it because,
you know,

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,180
he doesn't,
he didn't have much of a faith in the

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,790
ethical opinions of the masses.
He thought that ethics was a kind of

17
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:03,380
knowledge,
um,

18
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,440
that is extremely hard to attain.
He's right.

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,660
I mean,
that's one of the reasons we've left him

20
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:11,100
so far behind.

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,400
It's slowly,
slowly where we make progress,

22
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:16,170
ethical,
ethical progress.

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,270
Uh,
but he thought it was a kind of

24
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:22,440
knowledge and it takes a trained mind
and,

25
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,071
um,
you know,

26
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:27,090
it's harder than mathematics.
Mathematics is a preparation for this

27
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:31,050
kind of knowledge that you need,
that kind of dispassion and distance

28
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,310
and,
uh,

29
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:36,510
from your own life to be able to access
ethical knowledge.

30
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:41,511
So he would not have been very
interested in crowdsourcing and what is

31
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:47,571
the opinion of the masses of people.
And he also would say,

32
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:50,160
I think,
well then,

33
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,640
how do we ever make any ethical
progress?

34
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:56,430
How do we ever learn anything new,
um,

35
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,200
to,
to challenge our,

36
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,540
our intuitions,
if in fact it's just being crowdsourced.

37
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,490
I do have Plato,
I'm getting quite addicted to the

38
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:13,491
Internet and looking up things on,
on the Jana wikipedia constantly.

39
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:16,980
I mean,
that was partly,

40
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:19,140
I,
I needed a quick way to bring him up to

41
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:19,974
speed.

42
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,080
Uh,
and,

43
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:22,820
and he is constantly,
we carries,

44
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,720
he gets,
well while he's at the Google plex,

45
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:26,310
he gets a chromebook.
Um,

46
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,100
may give them a chromebook and he,
he carries it with him everywhere.

47
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:31,730
I mean,
he's constantly consulting it.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,701
Uh,
but again,

49
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:34,140
he is,
um,

50
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,310
he believed in,
in the expert.

51
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,780
Uh,
he believed,

52
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:41,550
you know,
an expertise.

53
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,241
Uh,
he,

54
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,060
he,
um,

55
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,580
aristotle,
his student was actually says some

56
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:50,490
things that are much more,
um,

57
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,620
uh,
continent or a favorable toward

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,090
crowdsourcing.
You know,

59
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:58,050
he says that,
you know,

60
00:02:58,051 --> 00:02:59,470
if you,
um,

61
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,380
go to,
uh,

62
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,270
a meal,
if it's just cooked by one person,

63
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:07,420
you may not like it.
But if it's a feast with many,

64
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,080
many people bringing their dishes,
you'll find something to like,

65
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,340
uh,
aristotle says,

66
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:17,160
and he really has an idea.
They're a of crowdsourcing.

67
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,090
Let's,
let's try to get as many points of view

68
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:21,520
as possible.
Plato is,

69
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,180
is very dubious of this.
He,

70
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:28,500
he believes that it's extremely
difficult to know anything.

71
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:30,880
It takes a tremendous amount of
training,

72
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,630
years and years of training.
Um,

73
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,700
he has the rulers of his state studying
advanced mathematics for 10 years before

74
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:42,340
they can even think about political
philosophy.

75
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,400
That's how hard he thinks these things
are.
