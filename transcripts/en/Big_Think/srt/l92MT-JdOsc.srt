1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,250
You know,
we're learning ways to perturb the brain

2
00:00:07,251 --> 00:00:10,280
and I'm just wondering,
do you think someday that people will be

3
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:14,930
sort of enhancing,
kind of quote unquote natural creativity

4
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:19,931
to get people to be more like what we
think of as geniuses or is that just not

5
00:00:20,691 --> 00:00:24,920
possible?
I love the idea of the vision that

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,190
there's a way to,
to,

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,400
um,
to bring out the genius in all of us and

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,890
I wish that there was a way that in our
educational system that we could develop

9
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:44,480
ways to promote creativity.
We do actually,

10
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:48,860
we're pretty good at it,
but we could be better that we could

11
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,130
teach people to take risks in education.
We could value more the,

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,820
um,
the,

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,040
the person that takes the path that is
not the common path.

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,210
I think we as a society are pretty good
at that.

15
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,720
We can be a lot better and I think that
that's one of the values of studying or

16
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,280
thinking about genius.

17
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,540
It's a way for us to think about cheap,
let's,

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,920
let's get better at this creative
business.

19
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,890
Let's,
let's find that creative spirit in all

20
00:01:21,891 --> 00:01:24,260
of us.
Let's move forward faster.

21
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:29,410
I think sometimes people think about the
brain has kind of a shortcut to all

22
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,570
these sorts of problems,
you know,

23
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,000
if we just understand the brain,
then we can just go right in there and

24
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:39,410
just fix things directly.
Whereas it is easy to forget that,

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,760
you know,
education itself is altered to the

26
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:45,560
brain.
Exactly.

27
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:49,550
I think that we have to think about
brains in the context of our society.

28
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,640
I'm in.
One of the things about genius,

29
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,000
I think it's not just an individual or
just to brain,

30
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,190
it's about opportunity.
It's about somebody who is given the

31
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,460
pathway to actually make a contribution.
It's think of our art musicians,

32
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,870
most of us would consider geniuses.

33
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,130
Bach,
Beethoven,

34
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,470
Mozart.
These are people that,

35
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,000
um,
were put in positions that allow them to

36
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:20,780
be creative.
The creative spirit comes with many

37
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:24,540
things other than just the brain.
I think it comes with opportunity.

38
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,800
It comes with resources,
with attitude.

39
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,310
Again,
I like the idea of not thinking of it as

40
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:35,720
something that the targets and
individual and separates them,

41
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,640
but something that joins us together as
a quality that belongs to all of us.

42
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,700
Well,
because it is true that when people talk

43
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:47,880
about genius as they are other,
they're there,

44
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,390
they're almost freakish.
Exactly.

45
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:55,391
And I think that that attitude really
deters people from taking the risk,

46
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,540
but it's a double edge sword.
The genius term is often associated with

47
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:05,770
a person that really changes the way we
think it could fit with something that

48
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:10,771
didn't exist before,
that changes the course of our progress

49
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,990
in some fundamental way.
So that person by his or her nature

50
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,170
stands out and is different.
And yet,

51
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,180
and yet all of us are different in our
creative sphere.

52
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,940
And that by incorporating the creative
person into the mainstream,

53
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,690
um,
it might be a way to encourage more

54
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:35,524
creativity

55
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,470
in a way.
Uh,

56
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:39,750
you know,
you've been talking a lot about the

57
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:43,230
things that neuroscientists can't tell
us about genius,

58
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:45,360
want easy answers and,
and we think,

59
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:46,900
oh,
these answers are on the brain and,

60
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,200
and you're kind of warning us like,
well,

61
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,070
we,
neuroscientists suite,

62
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,970
we don't know all that much.
The brain is a complicated thing and

63
00:03:53,971 --> 00:03:56,880
it's,
it's a social thing too.

64
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,710
So,
I mean,

65
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:03,711
what do you think that neuroscientists
can do to help us understand genius

66
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:05,101
better?
I mean,

67
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:07,890
what,
what are the kinds of studies that you

68
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:11,830
think would be like the best ones to do
to make us understand genius as,

69
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,870
as you think of it?

70
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,570
I think that in general,
the study of individual differences,

71
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,710
um,
is a really interesting direction to

72
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,570
take differences in.
Say there's some people that have

73
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,660
extraordinary memory and we can design
experiments to look at the neural

74
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:39,351
circuitry that's associated with memory
strategies and we learned something

75
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:45,241
about what makes one person better at
memorizing things than another.

76
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,360
There are differences in um,
how,

77
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,450
how well we do mathematics and how well
we can put things together and

78
00:04:56,951 --> 00:05:00,820
understanding the rules for those
differences is important.

79
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,360
For example,
one of the things that neuroscientists

80
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,620
have taught us recently is that the
parts of the brain are all so richly

81
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:17,851
interconnected and the extent to which
they are connected has a great deal to

82
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:19,150
do with function.

83
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,690
So we're talking about say a patch of
cortex over here and another patch over

84
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:29,590
here and there like cables.
Joining them together.

85
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,450
Indeed,
and how well those connections actually

86
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:34,670
work,
um,

87
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,240
is thought to contribute a great deal to
our individual differences.

88
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,670
Is it that some people have more
connections than others or bigger

89
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,030
connections or what's what,
what are those underlying differences?

90
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,680
Well,
it's all of the above.

91
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,930
In some cases the connections are
actually more richly innervated.

92
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:58,790
There are simply more of them in other
cases they to slightly different places.

93
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,390
Um,
in other cases they're just stronger

94
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:04,610
connections,
which means there's less noise in the

95
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:08,150
brain.
All of those hypotheses are,

96
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,630
are viable options as evidence for all
of them and they contribute to,

97
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,660
um,
considerable differences between

98
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,320
performances or one person or another.

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,170
So if we start to get down to these,
you know,

100
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,410
real kind of biological components of
creativity,

101
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:35,860
of innovation and of,
you know,

102
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:39,520
ultimately what we might call genius.
I'm wondering how can we start to kind

103
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:44,521
of figure out like are geniuses just
born or are they made or what can we

104
00:06:45,101 --> 00:06:47,980
figure can even figure out what the
differences are?

105
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,873
You know,
was,

106
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,650
was Einstein just a blank slate when he
was born and he just happened to have a

107
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,870
really good math teacher in first grade.
I mean,

108
00:06:55,871 --> 00:06:57,000
what,
you know,

109
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,690
how,
how do those connections,

110
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,300
what do we know about how those
connections develop,

111
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,231
uh,
in,

112
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:06,990
in children and teenagers and adults and
you know,

113
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,620
how the genes play a role in all that.

114
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,910
That really is the $64,000 question and
it is the question that we would like to

115
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:17,430
answer.
How does the brain do it and how do we

116
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:22,431
help the brain do it better?
I think that your question really raises

117
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:27,531
another really important point and that
is how much bigger are questions are

118
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,500
than our science,
our methodology.

119
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,620
We need a genius to figure this one out
because we need to be able to answer

120
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:42,171
those kinds of questions faster to
answer them better and we need to apply

121
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:45,840
them to our lives.
