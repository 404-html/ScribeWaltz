1
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,780
Especially with a platform technology
that you can go after many different

2
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,470
product applications,
but you ultimately get valued most

3
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:20,850
importantly on the first application you
bring forward and as an entrepreneur you

4
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:24,870
have limited time and limited resources,
so you need to choose well and drive

5
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:28,500
deep into clinical and regulatory
validation for that first product.

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,020
Now in order to make that often really
painful decision about what to invest in

7
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:36,180
and what to leave on the side,
at least for awhile,

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,530
there's many aspects of a certain
product you need to think through.

9
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,120
Obviously market size plays a role,
a technical fit to need plays a role.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,100
As I'm looking at new ideas,
I often try to follow some of the advice

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,260
I once got from Bob Langer,
who has been very prolific.

12
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,780
He's started roughly 50 companies out of
his lab,

13
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:58,170
I think at this point.
And I've had the honor of starting two

14
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:59,004
companies with them.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,920
Um,
among the other kind of rules of the

16
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:04,740
road.
He shares his first look for a platform

17
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:06,960
company.
If you're going to build a company,

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,450
make sure that if you're successful in
one area,

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,260
it can create value in a number of
adjacent areas because that really

20
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:17,100
justifies bringing in the investment,
building the whole infrastructure,

21
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,590
not just for one product,
but potentially for many,

22
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,490
but within that it's crucially important
and perhaps most important to select an

23
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:30,150
opportunity that has a very clearly
defined first product opportunity that

24
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:33,060
you have the ability to drive to a major
value creation,

25
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,870
a event like a regulatory or clinical
approval.

26
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,380
As you're building a business,
you ultimately get valued on that lead

27
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:43,800
asset you're carrying forward,
so it's important to have a platform but

28
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:47,640
not to lose focus within that platform
and make one crucial bet that ultimately

29
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,230
can drive the early success of your
company.

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,860
What really gets me excited is
developing new therapies that can help

31
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:54,810
patients.
In order to do that,

32
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:58,380
you need to think through who exactly is
the patient you're trying to help,

33
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,830
what disease do they have,
and what kind of clinical trial could

34
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:05,940
you design that really proves that
you're giving a benefit to that patient.

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,030
When you do that,
you have to think through what type of

36
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:11,010
therapy is practical,
how's it given,

37
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,960
how frequently and by whom and in order
to understand that whole pathway from

38
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:20,961
basic discovery to delivering an actual
therapeutic requires a great variety of

39
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:26,250
different skills you must bring together
and early in our startups,

40
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:29,520
what we've done is first focused on some
of the fundamental biology,

41
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,750
but then defined who are the experts
along the way that we're going to need

42
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:37,320
to engage in order to advance all the
way through the development regulatory

43
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:40,680
and clinical process,
and I can encourage young innovators

44
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,940
enough to think about engaging product
development experts and clinical experts

45
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,560
early in the discovery process because
that really shapes what you're trying to

46
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,330
discover and what you're trying to
create.

47
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,690
That can ultimately help the patient.
As I interact with a lot of young

48
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:57,030
entrepreneurs who are thinking of
starting companies,

49
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,980
the most important piece of advice I
like to give them,

50
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:03,970
particularly on the technical side,
is find someone who has totally

51
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:07,030
different skills from you that you can
trust and will challenge you.

52
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,730
It can help you think through the many
aspects.

53
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,210
It takes to address to build a business
or create a new therapy.

54
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,880
For me,
this was when Bob Langer introduced me

55
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:18,880
to David Lucchino,
who in 2005,

56
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,190
uh,
became my co founder of my first startup

57
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,560
and he took me out of the lab,
dragged me into the hospital and really

58
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:31,090
started meeting nurses and purchasers
and doctors who were people I'd never

59
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:35,340
really interacted with at a deep level
so I could start to understand if were

60
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,560
to develop a new product,
who are all the stakeholders this

61
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:41,830
product would need to satisfy and how
can I understand all of their

62
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:43,750
incentives,
all of their constraints.

63
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,320
Because ultimately to get a new product
to patients,

64
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,720
you need to understand the whole
delivery system.

65
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:53,260
It's must go through in order to bring
that forward and who must become

66
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:55,720
champions.
And the only way that was going to

67
00:03:55,721 --> 00:04:00,670
happen is by that early interaction in
introduction to David who brought a

68
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:03,220
business and marketing and totally
different background.

69
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,180
But we challenge each other.
We have mutual respect and it's let us

70
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:10,930
build now to businesses that have have
brought a number of exciting things into

71
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:13,180
the clinic.
In order to enter this industry,

72
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,010
uh,
particularly as an entrepreneur,

73
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:17,470
as a first timer,
and that was straight out of Grad

74
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:19,840
school,
I went into my first startup and really

75
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:24,610
had no experience developing products.
The advice I'd give is really to engage

76
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:29,260
people who've gone through that product
development experience very early on.

77
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,300
They'll have a lot of rules of the road,
a lot of mistakes to avoid a and can

78
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:38,380
really help make you successful even if
you don't have the deep domain

79
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:39,610
experience yet.

80
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,300
And it's amazing how much young
entrepreneurs who have a passion and

81
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:47,950
enthusiasm and some really big ideas can
engage in drawing people who have deep

82
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:52,270
experience even before potentially they
could afford them as consultants or

83
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:55,270
employees.
I think as entrepreneurs we're dreaming

84
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:57,190
big.
You can share that energy,

85
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,530
share that vision,
get people involved,

86
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,670
and really bring in a fantastic folks.
At the very early stage.

87
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,230
One lesson that was imparted to me early
in in my previous startup was to think

88
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,620
very critically about all the testing
and all of the features that a medical

89
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:18,130
device must go through to be successful.
We were essentially creating a new

90
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:20,620
technology to try to make medical
devices safer,

91
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,580
reducing clots or infection was
ultimately our goal for devices that

92
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:28,480
went into the body.
Now we thought initially as

93
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:32,080
technologists about the new feature we
are creating and how powerful it was and

94
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,930
how helpful it could be,
but as we started to work with

95
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:38,740
experienced product developers,
they made us realize that these devices

96
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,580
were designed with a certain application
in mind.

97
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,610
They needed to perform certain functions
first and foremost,

98
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,210
and as we're adding our new technology,
as we're making our advance,

99
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,920
we couldn't do any harm to the current
standard of care as we're adding new

100
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,200
features.
I knew an existing product and that even

101
00:05:56,201 --> 00:06:01,201
applies in thinking about not in any way
falling short of the standard of care in

102
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:03,410
some aspects as you're trying to
improve.

103
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:06,830
Another aspect is very important and
experience product developers can really

104
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:11,720
help you understand that process in
order to drive new innovative medicines

105
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:12,740
to the clinic.
Uh,

106
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,030
a critical aspect of this is developing
a strong intellectual property position

107
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:20,450
because of the great resources required
to advance the medicine.

108
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,230
It can be hundreds of millions of
dollars to advance from concept through

109
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:27,860
trials and even billions of dollars
before ultimate launch of a product.

110
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,400
In order to justify those kinds of
investments,

111
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,310
one needs to be able to have a product
that one can protect for a period of

112
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,970
time on the market.
The benefits of the patent system are

113
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,790
essentially it's a trade for a period of
time.

114
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,450
You're granted that right?
To be able to have exclusive access to

115
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:49,040
sell a certain medicine,
but in trade for that essentially have

116
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,370
to disclose to the world,
here's exactly how we did it and it can

117
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,810
let the world start thinking pretty
quickly about how can they do better and

118
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:59,180
at the end of the day,
whole fields of science,

119
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:02,540
advance new medicines move forward and
as things become generic,

120
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,300
things continued.
Medicines continue to reach a broader

121
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:06,650
and broader patient population.
