1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Very much believe that they should.
It's an important component and we

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:09,150
mustn't let that slip.
It does a certain amount of feeling does

3
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:11,010
a financial crisis,
can we really afford?

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,270
We have to because we have a very
connected world and what what's

5
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:19,080
happening in other parts of the world
will ultimately affect us unless you

6
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:24,081
have social stability.
So it is in the outcome document of this

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,200
summer that there must be a recommitment
to the 0.7% of GDP,

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,700
which is actually not a great amount
given the potential of being able to

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,780
have a safer and more balanced world.
We also know now that the way in which

10
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:48,660
we're living our lives based on carbon
in the rich parts of the world is

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,790
undermining development of the poorest
parts.

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,060
And there's a commitment that was made
in Copenhagen for an additional $30

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,660
billion a year over the next three years
to help the poorest and most vulnerable

14
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,660
countries.
I want to see that money as yet I don't

15
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:05,790
see any new money being committed by
countries.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,070
And even though there's a financial
crisis,

17
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,200
we can actually find the ability.
And then we need governments of the poor

18
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:18,201
countries to have a real sense of their
responsibility to govern on behalf of

19
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:19,944
their people.

20
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,140
They very much understand the stress and
the worry and the day to day concerns of

21
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:31,970
people who have,
um,

22
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,980
terrible mortgage problems who are
behind on their payments,

23
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:35,880
who,
uh,

24
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:40,260
know that they have problems of school
fees or university fee fees for the

25
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:41,130
young people,
et Cetera.

26
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,040
And it's the same in the modern Ireland.
We're going through a very tough time

27
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,590
and many countries in Europe and
elsewhere.

28
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,220
Uh,
but we have to see the connections in

29
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:51,001
our world.
I mean,

30
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:55,110
look at a country that has become what
we call now a failed stays pretty well.

31
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,830
Somalia,
you have pirates out on the open seas

32
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:02,580
from Somalia.
You have a danger of terrorist being

33
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:07,080
able to group where there is no law and
order and find ways of attacking,

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,580
um,
uh,

35
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,030
elsewhere in the world.
We are much more interconnected than we

36
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:16,290
have ever been.
It's in our total interests to help to

37
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,320
create middle classes in the developing
countries.

38
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,410
Then they will buy American goods.
They will want to trade to the profit of

39
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:25,680
everyone.
Um,

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,030
so I think it's,
it's hard when you're really wondering

41
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,380
how you're going to meet the commitments
for next month and a real worries about,

42
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,610
about food as,
as,

43
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,840
as,
as a woman has said.

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,560
But in fact,
uh,

45
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:43,561
I think any kind of sense of political
leadership now has to move in the

46
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,420
direction of understanding the
interconnections between our world.

47
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,050
And we will not have peace and security
if we do not have fairer balances

48
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,110
because we're not staying at the same
population level.

49
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,380
We're going to go up from just under 7
billion people today to over 9 billion

50
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,850
by 2050.
That's the largest increase in

51
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,760
population will ever seen.
And many of them are in very poor

52
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:10,330
countries.
So for stability for our own generation,

53
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:12,280
but particularly for our children and
grandchildren,

54
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,550
we have to have the sense of an
interconnected world.

55
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,590
I still firmly believe we need to keep
the commitments to development aid,

56
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,910
but I also agree with an increasing
number of African leaders and others who

57
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:30,700
say,
we want to bring ourselves out of

58
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,800
poverty,
we want fairer trade rules,

59
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,880
we want some subsidies removed.
That disadvantages and when we're trying

60
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:39,790
to compete on cotton or sugar,
etc. And,

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,470
um,
I think that we need to have more

62
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:48,220
emphasis on access to energy for the
poorest.

63
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,020
One of the things that has helped poor
countries greatly is the mobile phone.

64
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,340
That was the private sector,
uh,

65
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,360
creating a markers in the poor countries
and the mobile phone.

66
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,280
You know,
it attracts markets.

67
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,250
It transfers money,
it does help.

68
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,350
Surveyance it's how you can do education
on.

69
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,800
It's wonderful,
but there are 1.6 billion people who

70
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,740
have no access to electricity in our
21st century.

71
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,400
That's not acceptable.
If you give energy to the poorest,

72
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,600
they will be able to be more productive.
And there is that sense that age

73
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:21,400
shouldn't be sort of,
um,

74
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,750
kind of,
um,

75
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,300
uh,
we look after your needs and not make

76
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:28,330
the poor productive.
Many of us think that we have to have

77
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:32,470
much more emphasis on decent work as
part of the whole approach,

78
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,250
including by the private sector.
The companies that are operating like

79
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:40,540
Coca Cola or other companies in
developing countries must more and more

80
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,570
look at their whole value chain.
How do we create more jobs?

81
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,880
It's jobs that take people out of
poverty.
