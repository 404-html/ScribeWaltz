1
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,000
Well,
I'm a philosopher,

2
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:16,001
so I was thinking of soldiers in terms
of there's the meaning and philosophical

3
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:20,900
meaning of their stories,
the emotions and the deep emotions.

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,170
And I interviewed a lot of soldiers,
probably about 30 to 40 soldiers,

5
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:30,171
so the current wars and including some
from Bosnia and Vietnam and my dad who's

6
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:35,981
a World War II veteran and I really
wanted to go beyond just stories about

7
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,800
trauma of which many soldiers don't
suffer though,

8
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:44,120
of course we know many do,
but I wanted to talk about the feelings

9
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:48,530
everyone seems to come home with,
of trying to make moral sense of what

10
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:49,990
they've seen and done.
Um,

11
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,180
even when they do everything right by
wars,

12
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,290
best standards.
So it was talking about the,

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,560
the moral weight of war,
memorial burdens of war.

14
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,990
Well,
my dad actually just died,

15
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,410
um,
December 15th that the days I was

16
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:11,411
putting the final touches on the book
and I always knew he was a world war two

17
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:15,980
veteran and a medic.
He never fired a rifle a gun during the

18
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:19,100
war,
but always had this sense that war was

19
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:21,410
hell.
And he didn't want to talk about it like

20
00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:24,920
many of his generation,
a member of a laconic generation.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,510
And um,
when he died I was cleaning up as

22
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:34,370
affects and found in his pockets,
his dog tags and um,

23
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,230
he never told me and I never asked.
And so it was 65 years of carrying his

24
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:40,940
dog tags.
Um,

25
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:45,650
they were an identity to be sure,
but they're also a moral identity or

26
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:48,770
moral burden.
And I thought he really carried it

27
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:51,350
silently.
He thought it wasn't polite conversation

28
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:53,870
to talk about the war.
When I probed,

29
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:54,704
you know,
he would say,

30
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,770
well aboard the Qe one,
the Queen Elizabeth,

31
00:01:57,771 --> 00:02:00,260
the first and the Queen Mary,
it was a slaughter house.

32
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:05,090
It was a butcher shop,
was amputated legs and men that were

33
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,590
really,
really suffering,

34
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,690
um,
this one will have a leg in that one,

35
00:02:08,691 --> 00:02:10,670
Walt.
And so it was painful.

36
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:14,230
Tears would come down and I realized he
never wanted to watch footage of the war

37
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:17,300
and he wasn't traumatized,
I don't think is very healthy,

38
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:20,870
resilient guy.
But if his war was difficult,

39
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:22,040
it was so,
for many.

40
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,670
And I don't think war should be a
private burden,

41
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,970
um,
whether it's a draft war or a volunteer

42
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:33,110
force or your guard national guard or,
or you know,

43
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,000
a member.
Well,

44
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:37,430
contractors are,
no history is complicated story,

45
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:38,840
but go,
going out.

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,330
I'm going out to war part of the
reserves.

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,210
So he was,
I think the,

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,740
the,
the,

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,740
the,
the unconscious reason you might say.

50
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,520
I also have an uncle who fought in world
war two as a marine

51
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,250
bayonet,
Oka Allah,

52
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,410
really ugly.

53
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,420
And he did suffer ptsd,
posttraumatic stress disorder.

54
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,390
But the book isn't really about,
about psychological injuries that we

55
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:11,950
know about that are very acute.
It's about the everyday ordinary mix of

56
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:15,890
feeling exultant about the battle and
exuberant and that it's your,

57
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,560
the time of your life to,
to shine for some and that that's the

58
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:24,280
only way that you could go in and be a
sniper who's defending himself and his

59
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:26,090
buddies and to,
you know,

60
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,730
for,
for victory or survival.

61
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,060
And then also feeling the shame of,
of doing what you do when you do it.

62
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:33,550
All right.
