1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,480
So space x,
uh,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,090
is a response to
the history of space exploration.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,280
This is my point of view.
So one of the magical things about NASA

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,640
national and Space Administration here
in the US is the administration has

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,280
stayed about the same for 50,
1958.

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,230
What is that?
Fifty six years.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,100
The reason is congress had the,
either the ignorance or the genius to

8
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:39,711
put a dozen NASA centers in 12 different
for 13 different places around the US.

9
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,570
And when you try to close a NASA center
in Congress,

10
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:48,660
people come unglued and you can't close
a NASA center.

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,980
This is how people got to the moon.
Uh,

12
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,770
when John Kennedy was shot,
which was an awful thing,

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,670
any idea to cancel the moon program was
squashed as soon as Kennedy was shot,

14
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:07,050
we couldn't not not go as the expression
goes.

15
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,600
So humans went to the moon space program
existed,

16
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,110
changed the world and a great way A.
However,

17
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,270
it made things expensive.

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,870
When you build rocket engines in
Alabama,

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,080
you and you get the fuel from Utah and
you test them in Mississippi and you

20
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:32,661
then send them to Florida and control
all that from Texas with some drop

21
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:38,280
testing done in Cleveland and all sorts
of,

22
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,610
uh,
material science resources,

23
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,390
so on done in California,
some flight tests done in the desert of

24
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:46,680
Arizona.
When you do all that,

25
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:50,040
you just add cost.
When you go to space x,

26
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,090
the material,
the stainless steel and the aluminum

27
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:57,060
come off the train cars.
It goes through the factory like this.

28
00:01:57,061 --> 00:02:00,900
We make our tanks,
we make our space frame or airframe.

29
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,080
We make our rocket engine bells.
We make our,

30
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,060
we hook up our plumbing,
it goes back this way,

31
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:11,061
we do the wiring and it gets back on the
train car and goes to either Vandenberg

32
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,880
Air Force Base or Cape Canaveral or some
other place because it's all made in one

33
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:15,714
place.

34
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,990
But the way NASA was established in
1958,

35
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,780
it's not set up that way.
And that was good and bad.

36
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,140
So it is to be hoped that space x Sierra
Nevada space a blue origins,

37
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:31,950
that these companies will emerge and
lower the cost,

38
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,680
especially if taking stuff to low earth
orbit.

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,380
Keep in mind everybody,
for all the free market

40
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,960
libertarian,
let's go laissez faire people.

41
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,560
Space X has taken at least half a
billion dollars,

42
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:53,370
$500,
million dollars from NASA because NASA

43
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:57,750
wants to develop this capability.
When you buy an atlas five rocket or a

44
00:02:57,751 --> 00:03:02,410
Delta for rocket,
those commercially made gizmos and so is

45
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:07,411
going to be the Falcon Falcon heavy.
These are commercial rockets and NASA

46
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:10,720
has gone to great lengths to develop
that business.

47
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,510
It's all good.
It's all good.

48
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,190
I would go to space like that.
I applied to be an astronaut four times.

49
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,340
Uh,
I would love to get a view of the earth

50
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:22,174
from space.

51
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,660
And uh,
right now the price is $200,000.

52
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,470
Starts to come down into the 10th of
that.

53
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,950
I could,
I could imagine doing it if you've never

54
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:35,680
jumped out of a plane with a parachute.
That is cool.

55
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,440
I don't do it full time,
but I get it.

56
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,290
It's exciting.
And you do see the world in a new way

57
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,890
and you're in the air.
Everybody's dream is to be able to fly.

58
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,720
You're flying for a few moments.
It's.

59
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,150
I get it.
I can see how people get hooked on that.

60
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,700
And I think space exploration would be
the same deal.
