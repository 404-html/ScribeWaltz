1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,910
So what humans do,
that specialist,

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,930
we absorb all of these ideas,
all these inputs and we switched them up

3
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:14,610
in various ways and come up with new
things.

4
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:19,611
And so there are essentially three main
ways that the brain does this and we've

5
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:24,900
summarize this as bending and breaking
and blending.

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,410
So let's start with bending.
Bending is where you take something and

7
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:32,610
you,
you change it,

8
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:34,200
you make it smaller,
you make it bigger,

9
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,980
you change something about it.
When you look at statues across human

10
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:39,860
culture,
you find that that um,

11
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,210
people bend the human form any which
way,

12
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,650
making it taller,
skinnier,

13
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:45,510
emphasizing certain portions over the
other.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,810
They do that with all animal paintings
and sculptures and so on.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,440
You can bend lots of aspects of things.
So the artist Jr made a statue of the

16
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,880
high jumper,
Mohammed Idris,

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,300
uh,
for the Olympics and he put that super

18
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:02,730
huge and had him jumping over a
building.

19
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,320
And you have other sculptors that make
extremely tiny little figurines.

20
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,730
And one of the arguments we make is that
the exact same thing that's happening in

21
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:13,800
art,
the same cognitive processes are

22
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:15,480
happening in the sciences.
Also,

23
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,120
so you see exactly this kind of thing
happening all the time.

24
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:22,110
Just as an example,
in the early days of driving in the

25
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:24,870
1920s,
headlight glare was a real problem.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,860
So Edwin land,
um,

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,250
the scientist realized that he could
solve this by using polarizing crystals,

28
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:35,910
but those were very big at the time.
So he figured out how to shrink these

29
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:39,990
down and make a windshield out of all
these little polarized crystals.

30
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:44,850
It's exactly the same sort of Aha moment
as the artist who's making these tiny

31
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:47,880
figurines.
It's the same kind of bend going on.

32
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,520
And we see this all over in,
in biology.

33
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:54,240
Just as one example,
the artificial heart,

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,090
um,
since it was invented in the 1980s has

35
00:01:57,091 --> 00:02:00,510
been a mechanical pump,
but these are very energy hungry and

36
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:01,500
they get worn down.

37
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,630
And so in 2004,
a couple of physicians came up with a

38
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:11,631
continuous flow heart where blood flows
through and is oxygenated continuously.

39
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:15,690
So if you have one of these hearts,
you don't have a pulse at all.

40
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,150
Dick Cheney has one of these and he
doesn't have a pulse.

41
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,220
And so,
um,

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,130
this is a bend of what we find in
nature.

43
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:26,880
We get the idea of the heart and then we
bend it to make it compatible with what

44
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:28,620
we want.
And of course the airplanes are,

45
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,470
are a bend of,
you know,

46
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,510
what we witnessed birds doing and so on.
So there are many ways that you can bend

47
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:40,110
things and this is one of the great
things that the brain does all the time.

48
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,240
So breaking is where you take some
things,

49
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:47,130
some input that you've received and you
busted into pieces,

50
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:49,110
maybe leave pieces out or something like
that.

51
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,240
So just as an example,
um,

52
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,630
the artist cory archangel took the video
game,

53
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:58,500
Super Mario Brothers and he hacked into
it and he removed everything except for

54
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:01,180
the little clouds.
And then he made an art installation

55
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,690
where it was just the clouds and he
called it Super Mario Clouds.

56
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,610
What he was doing was taking part of it
away,

57
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,720
leaving part of it there.
That same kind of overt creativity that

58
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:14,470
happens in the arts is exactly what
happens in the scientific lab all the

59
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:18,190
time where you take certain parts away.
For example,

60
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:21,760
in my field,
there's a method that's used now in

61
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:25,230
neuroscience called clarity,
where you take the,

62
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:27,880
the brain,
which you can't see inside of,

63
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,900
and you wash away all the fatty
molecules so that you can see where the

64
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:36,550
pathways originate and where they go.
And in that way you can essentially make

65
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,930
part of the brain transparent.

66
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,470
You can suddenly see the pathways.
It's the exact same idea.

67
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,200
Just as another example,
um,

68
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,310
the artist David Hockney,
uh,

69
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,180
takes the,
the visual field and breaks it up into

70
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:52,040
pieces.
And the impressionist painters,

71
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,380
Surat,
um,

72
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,240
does pointillism.
So there's,

73
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,030
there's these sort of big dots and
you're seeing these dots.

74
00:03:58,031 --> 00:03:59,230
If you come up close,
you see them.

75
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:00,860
If you go far away,
it looks like a,

76
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,080
a painting.
And this exact same sort of breaking is

77
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:08,830
the innovation that underlies our whole
digital universe because there's

78
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,350
pixelation of everything you see on a
computer screen.

79
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,140
It's a bunch of individual squares that
have different colors.

80
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,370
And at the right distance,
you see me talking on a big think video.

81
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Fred sanger was trying to figure out how
to sequence long molecules of DNA.

82
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:27,880
And he realized that he could break
these up into smaller pieces and then

83
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,850
you can analyze and correlate the
information.

84
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,810
He actually ended up winning two Nobel
prizes for this work that he did,

85
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:38,080
and it's the basis of essentially
everything we know about genomes at this

86
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:40,750
point,
but it's all the same cognitive

87
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:45,040
operations that are happening that you
see both in the art and in the sciences.

88
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,370
What happens in the arts is overt
bending,

89
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:55,330
breaking and blending.
So you see all kinds of art projects

90
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:59,200
where people are taking things in,
they're bending them and in size or

91
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:02,410
texture or they're breaking them,
they're breaking pieces off or they're

92
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:06,130
blending two ideas.
This is the basis of all of the art that

93
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:11,131
we see exactly the same mechanisms are
happening in the scientific lab.

94
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:13,360
It's just that typically we can't see
them.

95
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,020
So when you pick up your cell phone,
it's this little rectangle that is

96
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:22,021
absolutely chock full of creativity,
of really brilliant ideas that went into

97
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:23,710
the making of that.

98
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,920
But you can't see it because it's just a
little,

99
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:27,280
you know,
enclosed thing.

100
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:31,300
But the interesting part is it's,
it's exactly the same cognitive

101
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:34,120
mechanisms,
which is to say absorbing the world,

102
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,010
bending,
breaking and blending it and spinning

103
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:40,600
out new versions of things.
One of the things that we love about our

104
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:45,601
computers is that we can put information
in there and then when we pull it out a

105
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,660
year later,
it's exactly the same.

106
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:50,560
It's exactly the same zeros and ones.
The human brain doesn't work that way.

107
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:53,800
When you put stuff in,
it gets switched up with other things

108
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:57,740
that have come in before.
And what comes out are,

109
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,780
you know,
new versions of things.

110
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,890
So blending is where you have two
completely separate ideas and then these

111
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:06,500
become blended in the brain and
something new comes out.

112
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:08,150
So just as an example,
uh,

113
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:11,420
in ancient mythology,
we see this all throughout where you

114
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:12,290
have a,
for example,

115
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,300
a man and the why and,
and,

116
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,130
and you got a sphinx or you get all over
the world,

117
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:18,770
different combinations,
Elian and a goat.

118
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,410
You get a chimera.
Um,

119
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,050
exactly the same thing happens in the
lab.

120
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,450
Just as one example,
um,

121
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,990
scientists have long wanted to harvest
spider silk,

122
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:32,390
which is actually stronger than steel
for its size,

123
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,870
but you can't get a bunch of spiders
together or they'll eat each other.

124
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:40,871
So what a geneticists did as he spliced
out the gene that makes spider silk and

125
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:46,841
put it in a goat and made freckles the
spider goat who secretes spider silk in

126
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:50,600
her milk.
She's a real life Kymera.

127
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,680
And this idea of taking two separate
things in blending them is something

128
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:55,680
that,
uh,

129
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,710
humans do all the time.
We take very different concepts and we

130
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,553
put them together.

131
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:07,380
Okay.
