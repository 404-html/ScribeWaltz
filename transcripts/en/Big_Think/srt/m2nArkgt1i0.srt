1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,770
Many people come to me and they see how
courageous they see me.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,330
And very often,
uh,

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,650
maybe in shocking way I said,
but I don't find myself courageous.

4
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:14,340
I,
I find myself passionate and I love what

5
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:15,930
I do.
And if I love what I do,

6
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:18,780
I'm going to do it all day long.
And if I do it all day long,

7
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:22,830
I probably will be very good at it soon.
And that's the story of my life.

8
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:24,900
I started,
I was not born,

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,030
uh,
in the [inaudible] for example,

10
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:30,330
where the wire walkers are.
So I learned by myself.

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,063
Yeah.

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,480
As I was learning all my arts,
magic,

13
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,850
juggling the high wire,
writing books,

14
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:47,440
making films,
all those things.

15
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,740
I realize maybe by looking at performers
and also by,

16
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:56,860
uh,
becoming one that the most powerful way

17
00:00:56,861 --> 00:01:01,600
to inspire people to touch in audience
is not to try to touch them,

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,860
is to be yourself.
If you write a novel for what the people

19
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:10,510
want to weed while you do a wider than
that will be an interested in.

20
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,110
But if you're right,
because you are divorced inside by a

21
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:17,560
fire and then you need to write,
or the painter needs to paint,

22
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,330
um,
then,

23
00:01:19,331 --> 00:01:20,800
then your work,
um,

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,230
will be interesting.
And actually some people may hate it.

25
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:25,090
Oh My,
love it.

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,450
Which actually are distant cousins.
It's much more interesting than people

27
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:28,991
says,
oh,

28
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:32,030
I don't remember that work of art.
Um,

29
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,890
but you will cause a,
a human response much more,

30
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:38,620
which that if you try to please,
if you try to,

31
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,331
you know,
in,

32
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:40,720
in,
in performance,

33
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:42,670
in show business,
and I hate that term.

34
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,910
You see people on stage,
a juggler,

35
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,350
imagination.
They tried to make the people love the,

36
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:50,530
try to make them upload.
And by doing that,

37
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,170
they take away from their art.
Uh,

38
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:55,630
you have to find your own personality,
your own style,

39
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:59,590
and that takes sometimes a lifetime or
you can copy people and that's,

40
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:01,570
you know,
an artistic crime.

41
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,050
Um,
but to go the easy way in to try to be a

42
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:08,860
crowd pleaser at a very young age in my
life,

43
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,940
I realize that was a form of,
uh,

44
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,560
[inaudible] [inaudible].
