00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,953
Hey there.
This is Jason Guts and you're listening 

2
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:04,680
to think again.
A big thank podcast

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,913
since 2008 I think has been bringing you
the big ideas in little doses from some 

4
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,370
of the most creative thinkers around.
On the thing again,

5
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:19,560
podcast,
we step outside of our comfort zone,

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,830
surprising our guests and me,
your host with unexpected clips from big

7
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:25,851
things,
synergy you,

8
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:26,684
archives,
ideas that we didn't necessarily come 

9
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:29,094
here prepared to discuss.
This is the fourth mix tape that I'm 

10
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:33,564
doing of some of the highlights of the 
first year of the show and just time to 

11
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:39,720
reflect back and think about where we've
been.

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,900
As you may have noticed if you're 
following the show,

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,943
I have a lot of creative writers on.
I'm a writer myself and I think a lot 

14
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:49,404
about the craft of writing and some of 
the guests have given our listeners 

15
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,790
advice that I find incredibly powerful 
and that stays with me all the time.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,953
This episode is an attempt to round up 
some of those best moments from those 

17
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:06,960
most powerful moments.
Advice about writer's block,

18
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,380
how to work with the creative team,
how to deal with success and failure and

19
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:15,180
how to deal with the psychology of being
a writer.

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,300
I hope that you'll find these moments as
meaningful as I do.

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,633
This first segment is from a 
conversation with the acclaimed 

22
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,600
playwright and screenwriter,
Sir David Hare.

23
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:28,943
He really surprised me.
There was a really interesting and 

24
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:35,961
unexpected turn in the middle of this 
conversation that I found delightful and

25
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:42,021
the surprise quip is with Sheila keen 
talking about the psychology of happened

26
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:43,634
happiness.

27
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,593
If you look at the neuroscience,
the way that we're wired has a profound 

28
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:52,060
effect on how we hear and respond to 
feedback.

29
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,343
We took a look at three variables that 
are particularly important in terms of 

30
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:58,990
your reaction to feedback.
The first is your baseline.

31
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,063
It's sort of how happy or unhappy are 
you in the absence of other events in 

32
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:03,964
your life.
Where's that level that you come back 

33
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:06,424
to?
It's a scale of one to 10 some people 

34
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:10,060
just live their lives at nine right 
there,

35
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:12,940
just so unbelievably happy and cheerful 
about everything.

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,860
This research comes from looking at 
lottery winners a year later.

37
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:21,070
They're about as happy or unhappy as 
they were before they won the lottery.

38
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,143
And people who go to jail a year later,
they're about as happy or unhappy as 

39
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,910
before they went to jail.
Now we look at the second variable,

40
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:28,744
which is swing.
When you get positive or negative 

41
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:31,264
feedback,
how far off your baseline does it knock 

42
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:33,664
you?
The same piece of feedback can be 

43
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:39,520
devastating for one person and you know,
kind of annoying for another.

44
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,803
And then the third variable is how long 
does it take you to come back to your 

45
00:02:44,171 --> 00:02:46,480
baseline?
How long do you sustain positive feeling

46
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,250
or how long does it take you to recover 
from negative feeling so taken together.

47
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:54,490
That's where the big variation in 
sensitivity comes from.

48
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:58,750
That some people are extremely sensitive
and other people are pretty insensitive.

49
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,040
Um,
or maybe I should

50
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,520
say even keel,
but I suppose if you're insensitive,

51
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,170
you don't really care what I call you,
so it doesn't matter.

52
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,940
So there's a lot in there.
Well,

53
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,540
there are two principle things,
yes.

54
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,270
About what she's saying,
the feedback thing.

55
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,820
Um,
I work in the collaborative arts.

56
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,740
I choose to be a playwright rather than 
a novelist or a poet.

57
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,810
And therefore for me,
collaboration is absolutely essential.

58
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,950
If I'm working on a movie set or if I'm 
in a rehearsal,

59
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,173
then the whole day what I have written 
is put under a degree of scrutiny and 

60
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:38,274
the actors in particular will say to me,
you think that in the interest of the 

61
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:45,480
general story,
you have achieved this scene.

62
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,430
But let me tell you from my point of 
view,

63
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:51,630
playing it as one person in this scene,
there is not enough for me here.

64
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:55,650
I haven't got what I want or I can't 
make sense of this change to which I can

65
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:56,484
only respond either by arguing or going 
back and rewriting in order that the 

66
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:01,824
woman or man who's playing this 
particular part will fit into the 

67
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:07,890
general picture and be able to play what
they want to play.

68
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,920
In other words,
they're going to put it under a scrutiny

69
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,083
that maybe you have overlooked in your 
rush to follow the main narrative 

70
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:18,810
through.
And so you're making adjustments all the

71
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:19,644
time and you're accepting feedback.
My experience is you can do that from a 

72
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,490
position of confidence.
In other words,

73
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:31,200
if you're confident about what the 
general movement of the play or film is,

74
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,273
then there is no end to the amount of 
input that you're open to because you 

75
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:36,774
know that it will not be destructive 
because you know that the resilience of 

76
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,154
the basic idea of what you're doing,
we'll see you through and the thing 

77
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:50,841
can't be damaged by minor adjustments.
And if you're working with great actors,

78
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:55,380
as I've spent my life working with some 
of the greatest actors in the world,

79
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,363
you're just crazy not to listen to them 
because what they're going to bring to 

80
00:04:58,471 --> 00:05:00,900
it is going to be incredibly useful to 
you.

81
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,460
So from that point of view,
feedback is what I live on.

82
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,770
That's,
that's my element and opinion.

83
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:11,940
Remember is the element that any 
creative person has to swim in.

84
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,590
In other words,
you know,

85
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,890
a play doesn't exist until it's put 
before an audience.

86
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,300
And what the audience's opinion is,
is what finishes that play off.

87
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,360
You know when you,
when people want to become actors,

88
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,700
young people,
I say to them,

89
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,500
you think you're going out there and 
you're going to create other people,

90
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,363
it's going to be creative.
I said half your job is going to be 

91
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,030
being judged.
How?

92
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,873
If your job is going to be out there and
sensing that the audience don't like 

93
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:42,180
you,
are you up for that?

94
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,163
Do you have the kind of temperament that
is going to be able to cope with the 

95
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:47,244
dislike of large numbers of people?
You're going to fail in certain roles 

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,700
and when you fail in certain roles in 
front of people,

97
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:55,860
it's going to be deeply embarrassing.
Shaming,

98
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:58,460
humiliating and upsetting.
Are you up for that?

99
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,563
Are you up for being judged?
And that's what working in the 

100
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:03,800
collaborative arts involves.

101
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,060
Well,
let me ask you this because I understand

102
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:07,894
from your memoir and just from the way 
you write that you're a sensitive 

103
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:12,274
person.
You know you are a very sensitive 

104
00:06:13,931 --> 00:06:14,764
person.
So when you were just starting out as a 

105
00:06:17,621 --> 00:06:18,700
playwright,
you know,

106
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:22,030
if somebody had said that to you,
if somebody had come and said like,

107
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,940
do you have what it takes?
Is your skin thick enough?

108
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,360
Would you have recoiled in horror and 
crawled into a corner?

109
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,540
Completely.
I,

110
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,690
I would.
I would not have chosen this job.

111
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,470
I had known the degree of judgment that 
it would involve.

112
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,333
I have sat in audiences where the 
audience is rejected the play and did 

113
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:44,450
not want to hear what I wanted to say to
them and an extremely pay.

114
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:45,284
It ripped my soul out.
It was a night in Seattle where a film 

115
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:48,794
of mine was laughed off the screen in 
1987 with a test audience to a preview 

116
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:54,434
audience.
I will never go back to the city of 

117
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:57,450
Seattle,
but listen in the,

118
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,110
in the time available to us.
Let's go back to her other point,

119
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,500
which is really interesting.
The happiness thing.

120
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:06,080
You know that a year later the person 
who is in jail,

121
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,110
is that the same level of happiness that
they were before they were in Joe,

122
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,270
I'm afraid.
I think this is true.

123
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,583
When you're young,
you have a fantasy that you can change 

124
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,490
and that you can change your life and 
you will achieve something and then when

125
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:20,324
you achieve that thing,
that will make a significant difference 

126
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:25,280
to your contentment index.

127
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,200
In other words,
you're driven by fantasy.

128
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,620
When you're my age,
there is no fantasy left.

129
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,603
You know,
I am extremely happily married to a 

130
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:36,050
completely wonderful woman whom I 
absolutely adore.

131
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,900
My children I adore.
Therefore,

132
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:43,400
my private life could not be any happier
than says there is no fantasy about my,

133
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,413
I do not go to sleep dreaming of meeting
some other woman who will transform my 

134
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:49,154
life.
I adore the person that I am with and 

135
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,800
can imagine no better do you see,
nor will I do.

136
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:58,070
I dream of writing a hit to play.
I've written hip place.

137
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,170
I know what it feels like.
I've lived through it.

138
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,570
It doesn't significantly change your 
life.

139
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,390
You still have to start again and try 
and write the next one.

140
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,810
So I feel that what she says about how 
the sort of basic level of happiness you

141
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:14,060
have in your life,
it doesn't really change very much.

142
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,370
One of my favorite conversations was 
with Turkeys,

143
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,233
arguably in most celebrated living 
novelist or Han Pamuk who won the Nobel 

144
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,363
Prize for literature.
Here he's talking about something I've 

145
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:32,020
never really heard a writer discussed 
before,

146
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,273
which is the psychology of sitting down 
every day to write and how a creative 

147
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:39,424
writer should manage that.
I find this to be incredible advice and 

148
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:47,521
the surprise clip is from psychologist 
Bessel Vanderkolk on trauma.

149
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:51,843
Okay.

150
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,860
Psychiatry has always had a complex 
relationship to trauma.

151
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,133
It started who started off as a 
discipline that looked at way back in 

152
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:01,644
the late 18 hundreds people have very 
bizarre reactions to trauma and so 

153
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:07,404
there's that define hysteria,
sort of a some interested and then they 

154
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:12,144
put it Kubashen.
It's people no longer a large studies 

155
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,510
theory.
First World War breaks out a huge number

156
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:21,210
of charm.
It has guys probably had lots to do with

157
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:25,890
the rise of Nazism.
And then in 1947 the last book about war

158
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:26,724
charm,
it gets published and there's nothing 

159
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:32,370
til 1982 or something.
So it takes a long time.

160
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,490
Very psychiatry really doesn't want to 
see trauma.

161
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,713
And in the current Dsm,
the people called the Bible of 

162
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,933
Psychiatry,
now we live with via diagnoses like 

163
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,370
oppositional defiant disorder where 
people don't ask,

164
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:48,204
why did this kids come become defiance?
Bipolar disorder cause being mentally 

165
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:53,963
unstable going up and down at the 
emotions and psychiatry does video what 

166
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,940
to look at,
what's behind there.

167
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,580
And as a consequence,
the,

168
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,423
instead of looking at social conditions 
as being at the origin of these 

169
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,990
disorders,
uh,

170
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,853
these kids get dragged up last year in 
the u s kids got 18 point $1 billion 

171
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:18,411
versus secretary we drugs and these 
drugs do calm people down.

172
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,840
But they also work on the reward system 
in the brain and decrease curiosity,

173
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,490
openness,
experimentation,

174
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,230
engagement with people.
So the neglect of the issue of trauma in

175
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,070
the u s in particular is a very serious 
public health issue.

176
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,970
For me,
the biggest traumas of life is of course

177
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,863
unrequited love.
My Normal Museum of innocence is 

178
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:51,411
extensively about the illusions of flow.
I chronicle upper middle class,

179
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,040
Turkish men's obsession infatuation.
It is twice removed.

180
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,590
Cousin,
just like a trauma,

181
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,310
he can never get out of it.
He's ridiculed and made fun of,

182
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,090
and a trauma means you are almost in a 
war.

183
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,220
Your panic,
you don't know what to do.

184
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,083
You want to survive and you lack that 
sense of logic that will control and 

185
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:22,341
heal you and perhaps paved the way out 
of a traumatic situation.

186
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:28,200
My understanding of a trauma is that you
want to get out of a situation,

187
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,350
but yet you're so much pressure that 
your mind does not give you the clue out

188
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:38,280
of that kafkaesque way out of that 
problem.

189
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,353
Lau is like that.
Perhaps psychology psychiatrist should 

190
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:47,340
focus about Lao treated as that trauma.

191
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,810
I am against all this glorification,
sugar rising,

192
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,810
put them on a pedestal.
The idea of love is a sweetie.

193
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,240
I agree.
It's the sweetest thing,

194
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,690
but it all comes with a bad package of 
trauma,

195
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,760
longing,
jealousy,

196
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,950
anger,
miscommunication,

197
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,120
self obsession,
making you not see the whole picture.

198
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,750
I'm a writer in,
I want to be,

199
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,643
I'm a self conscious writer,
a writer who wants to know the effects 

200
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,473
of what he or she is doing,
but also there is one side to me that 

201
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,873
makes me survive.
Perhaps that is letting things go and 

202
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:33,241
just following the music that is 
spontaneously coming inside of me.

203
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,190
Colors,
notes,

204
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:41,370
verge that I'm possessed with Indian.
If you write every day like me,

205
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,053
sit on a table everyday traumas and 
vanish perhaps because I know that life 

206
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:51,340
will be hard if I brought working in an 
office.

207
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,480
I choose the life of the solitary artist
writing every day,

208
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,720
which avoids me from the pressures and 
traumas of everyday life,

209
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,410
but it's inimitable.

210
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,170
Life is in the end.
Daily life.

211
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,250
I mean you are working hard.
You create a structure,

212
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:11,160
you sit down every day,
you have a discipline,

213
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:15,180
so somehow those structures are 
sufficient.

214
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:20,010
Then you don't have to worry as much 
about trying to control the rest.

215
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,473
I argued that a creative writer 
professor should teach more about this 

216
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,810
than what should be the plot.
What should be the,

217
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:29,644
because normative structural policies 
about writing fiction is less important 

218
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:37,740
than teaching.
The would be writer,

219
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,310
how to behave in life,
how to take easy,

220
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:46,550
the regular systematic traumas,
writing blogs,

221
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,370
unhappiness,
money,

222
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,030
happiness,
and depressive slowing down.

223
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Being a writer is more about minding 
your mental health,

224
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,373
navigating according to your moods,
what section chapter of the book you 

225
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:07,920
should write first because it's 
appropriate to your moods now,

226
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,600
what to do when you're blocked and how 
to skip one chapter,

227
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,920
skip one trauma,
skip one problem and continue.

228
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:22,000
I understand that psychiatry address 
traumas I taught,

229
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:22,834
they were already doing that.
I taught by the people we're going to 

230
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:28,840
people and paying money and because they
had traumas.

231
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:29,674
Now I learned they go for other reasons.
I would go to a psychiatrist because I 

232
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,374
had a trauma.
If I were to fall in love and never get 

233
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,374
out of Logan field that I'm hurt or if 
I'm blocked by my writing and feel that 

234
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:45,310
I'm scared of something.
I had traumas,

235
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,250
political representative traumas.
In the past.

236
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,860
In the end they gave me nightmares,
but the long run,

237
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,903
they just pass away.
If you are busy with something that 

238
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,010
makes you happy and it writing,
writing,

239
00:14:58,011 --> 00:14:59,540
writing,
Oh yes,

240
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,450
gave me lots of problems.
But in the long run,

241
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,070
I achievement of finishing something and
being like a child,

242
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,460
playing with his toys,
being busy with all the time,

243
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,860
sols,
all the traumas of two worlds.

244
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,990
I want to ask you like when you sit down
and your brain isn't working that day,

245
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,100
does that happen?
Whenever,

246
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,220
boy,
then what do you do?

247
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,420
Hemingway has a nice advice.
He said at the end of today,

248
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,290
if you know what you're going to write,
don't write the last sentence.

249
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,400
Keep it for the next morning.
So start with that sentence.

250
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,870
Once you write a beautiful sentence,
that sentence will tell you what will be

251
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:41,700
the next,
what will be the next,

252
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:45,090
what will be the next?
When you're writing fiction,

253
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,373
if you're in it eight sentence,
you have a magic feeling that it's 

254
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,030
unfolding on his own.
You look a lot of your window.

255
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,043
You look at say New York silhouette or 
Bosphorus that I see from my window and 

256
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:03,180
my mind as if processed because I'm so 
deeply in it.

257
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,330
You continue like that.
Eh?

258
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,290
I think if you work three hours a day,
if you write three pages,

259
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,320
if you work nine hours a day,
you write not nine pages but 18 pages.

260
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,243
Once creativity goes up exponentially,
once you devote your life whole life to 

261
00:16:23,701 --> 00:16:26,160
it,
even your sleep to it.

262
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:31,490
The way to get out of our traumas in 
fact is to invent a second world fictive

263
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:36,210
world or artistic world that will avoid 
the trauma,

264
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,930
but perhaps going to a psychiatrist who 
understands you,

265
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,980
maybe something,
but then maybe you can try it anymore.

266
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,320
Yes.
This is the thing that my friends always

267
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:51,550
tell me or and I see you're traumatized.
I can give you this pill,

268
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,020
but maybe tomorrow are feel happy and 
that you cannot write again.

269
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,520
Is that sent through contradiction in my
life?

270
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,683
Perhaps because I'm happy I cannot write
perhaps because I'm so unhappy I can 

271
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:10,360
write.
These are reasonable contradictions.

272
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,320
I think a writer's life has all of these
variations,

273
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,483
but in the end,
sailing with good Ville and bleeding in 

274
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:24,160
the wind is the essential and you sell 
on and on and on and on,

275
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,040
and I'm writing fiction for the last 40 
years.

276
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,083
After 40 years of sailing,
I have a sense that this wind will take 

277
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:34,090
me a twit.
Nice,

278
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,560
quiet,
good,

279
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,663
beautiful place.
I trust them in and sail and sail and 

280
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:40,684
right then right

281
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,610
earlier this year,
I sat down with author James McBride,

282
00:17:48,611 --> 00:17:50,160
who won the book award

283
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,993
for the color of water to talk to him 
about his memoir or biography 

284
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:58,050
investigation into the life of James 
Brown.

285
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,543
Here.
He brings up his recent experiences in 

286
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,090
what must have been one of the most 
interesting writers rooms ever.

287
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,230
The surprise quip is from journalists,
Charles Duhigg,

288
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,040
who wrote the power of habit talking 
here about creative teams.

289
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,443
About five years ago,
Google started this interesting 

290
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,563
experiment.
They wanted to figure out how to build 

291
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:26,564
the perfect team and so what they did is
they started collecting huge amounts of 

292
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:30,434
data about all the teams within Google.
The teams that at a glance look most 

293
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:35,744
productive oftentimes aren't.
But if you can create this 

294
00:18:39,711 --> 00:18:42,470
conversational turn taking equality of 
voices,

295
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,483
if you can convince people to really 
listen to each other by being sensitive 

296
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:50,810
to the nonverbal cues were giving off,
then you create psychological safety and

297
00:18:50,811 --> 00:18:51,644
psychological safety is the single 
greatest determinant in whether a team 

298
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:57,470
comes together or whether it falls 
apart.

299
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,633
One of my favorite examples of 
psychological safety and a team really 

300
00:19:01,011 --> 00:19:04,550
come to coming together is the early 
days of Saturday night live.

301
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,220
So when you think about it on Saturday 
night live,

302
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,990
never should have worked,
right?

303
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:13,430
You have a bunch of Comedians who are 
kind of misanthropes to begin with,

304
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,520
and yet for some reason when Lauren 
michaels put them in a room together,

305
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,700
everyone was willing to kind of get 
along.

306
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,950
They,
they were willing to put aside their ego

307
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,800
and create this amazing show together.
Not only an amazing show,

308
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:28,700
but a show that was put together under 
these incredible time pressures,

309
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:29,534
right?
They have a week to put together a live 

310
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:31,814
show.
And when I talked to the early writers 

311
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:36,380
and performers on Saturday night live 
and I asked them why this happened.

312
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,500
All of them said the same thing because 
of Lorne michaels.

313
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,790
So Lauren Michaels has this very unique 
way of running meetings.

314
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,343
He sits down and the meeting starts and 
what he'll do is he'll make everyone go 

315
00:19:48,711 --> 00:19:49,544
around the table and say something,
and if someone hasn't spoken up in a 

316
00:19:52,311 --> 00:19:53,144
little while,
Lauren michaels will actually stop the 

317
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:56,120
meeting and he'll say,
Susie,

318
00:19:56,121 --> 00:19:56,954
I noticed that you haven't chimed in.
Like what are you thinking about right 

319
00:19:59,091 --> 00:20:01,670
now?
And it all works out,

320
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,140
but it's because he creates an 
environment that feels safe,

321
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,153
where everyone feels like they can speak
up and they feel like everyone else is 

322
00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:11,204
genuinely listening to them because 
they're sensitive to all the cues that 

323
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:15,854
they're sending.

324
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,553
I think that kind of analysis is a dream
killer for me because I think when you 

325
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,430
analyze stuff too much you,
the next thing you know it's like,

326
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,110
you know,
analyzing sex.

327
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:34,070
I mean we should we write a report when 
we're done check lists of,

328
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:35,440
you know,
two phones,

329
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,580
one to five.
How did you,

330
00:20:36,581 --> 00:20:37,510
how was it?
I mean,

331
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,050
yeah,
I,

332
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,310
I think that kind of thinking is 
dangerous for the creative process.

333
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,150
Like if you come in with that method and
no,

334
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,680
I mean,
whatever method of following.

335
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:47,471
No.
Yeah,

336
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:48,310
I wouldn't,
I mean,

337
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:49,390
look,
I wouldn't fall,

338
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,560
what's his name?
Lorne.

339
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,850
Lorne michaels.
I wouldn't find his method.

340
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:53,684
I'd follow my method.
Everybody has a different solar as 

341
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,860
different way of singing that song.
I think the collaborative process,

342
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:00,694
which is really what the journalist is 
talking about is dictated by what you 

343
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:06,820
need to create and who's in the room.

344
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,713
And so that process works for that 
particular group of people given the 

345
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:15,070
time constraints that exist.
I don't know that that would work.

346
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,880
If you are writing for a six part mini 
series like I did.

347
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:19,714
Uh,
I was one of the writers in a six part 

348
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:23,020
mini series for David Simon and 
creative.

349
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:26,560
The wire has an area that's called the 
parting the waters.

350
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:30,610
It's about Taylor branch is three book 
series about the civil rights movement.

351
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,200
I'll be watching myself,
ta-nehisi codes,

352
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,870
tail brands,
David Simon.

353
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:39,310
Now we're going there.
What was it like being in a writing room

354
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:43,060
with David Simon and Tanahashi and like 
how did that go?

355
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,290
Well,
it was great.

356
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,951
I mean,
uh,

357
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:46,390
that work.
Like it was free.

358
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:48,190
I mean,
David didn't point that.

359
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:49,420
She wouldn't say,
what are you thinking?

360
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,670
You know,
he did it a different way and he said,

361
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:52,480
uh,
you know,

362
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,313
we have to decide which story we're 
going to tell and who's going to tell 

363
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:56,164
it.

364
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,340
He's like,
count base,

365
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,031
you know?
I mean,

366
00:21:58,031 --> 00:21:58,990
he's like Duke Ellington,
me,

367
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:03,700
like Duke Ellington had a band of great 
soloists and he'd say,

368
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:06,700
this is the composition.
Now put your thing to it.

369
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,350
David is the same way.
You know,

370
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,360
he says this,
these are the parameters.

371
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,263
You're,
you're all small little kings and your 

372
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,663
kingdom.
Let's bring our kingdoms together and 

373
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:18,760
see which one of us can come up with the
best idea.

374
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:21,430
Whoever has the best idea,
we'll run with that.

375
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,740
So you can't bring a lot of ego into a 
room like that.

376
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:24,723
You have to be at,
you're there to serve as a story and a 

377
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:30,070
good writer will serve as the story.
A good musician will serve as the music.

378
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,100
As a novelist,
how do you work?

379
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,080
Do you plot out everything before you 
write or,

380
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:37,140
and you just,
no,

381
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:39,430
I don't.
I have no standard way of doing it other

382
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:42,190
than getting up at four o'clock in the 
morning and getting to work.

383
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,153
You can,
you can write at four o'clock in the 

384
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:45,220
morning.
Okay,

385
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,970
well I,
I,

386
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,070
you know,
I go to bed at nine all right,

387
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,650
if I go to bed at 11 I get up at four 
o'clock anyway.

388
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,960
I'll take a nap at 11:00
AM until,

389
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:53,681
you know,
I mean,

390
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:56,830
the discipline of music taught me how 
the necessity of practice.

391
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:59,560
But going back to your earlier statement
about this room full of writers,

392
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,290
if you're a real serious writer,
you,

393
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,500
you are a servant to the story you 
writing chooses you,

394
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:06,334
you don't choose it.
So when you're working with other 

395
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:10,540
writers,
you have to service the idea.

396
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:11,374
And that's really where craft comes into
the trade shows itself because then you 

397
00:23:15,281 --> 00:23:17,740
have to be able to throw left handed in 
Bat,

398
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:20,470
right handed a bat right hand and throw 
left handed.

399
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,730
Right?
You have to be able to,

400
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,610
you have to be able to hit a curve ball 
in the bottom of the seventh,

401
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,493
two out in guy on base.
You just have to be able to do it 

402
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,620
because if you don't,
you bring in the whole team down.

403
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,170
So you have to learn how to play every 
position.

404
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,560
You're a person who's collab and you've 
done musics and you've collaborated with

405
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:37,150
other people.
You've done theater.

406
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,210
Tanahashi has written a comic book just 
now.

407
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,350
Uh,
you know,

408
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:43,060
so there's a,
just,

409
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:45,070
I think of like some of these folks,
you know,

410
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,400
William Faulkner,

411
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,233
you know,
the folks like sitting alone in their 

412
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:49,064
room for their whole lives would 
probably freak out if they suddenly had 

413
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:52,760
to share the table.

414
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,360
Prob more maybe,
maybe.

415
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,213
I mean,
but I must say that writing is a lonely 

416
00:23:58,141 --> 00:23:58,974
life.
And so working with other writers in 

417
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:03,720
this particular situation was just a lot
of fun.

418
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,500
And my problem is that at my age,
you know,

419
00:24:07,501 --> 00:24:10,290
I walk into a room and I started talking
to people get intimidated.

420
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,250
They think that,
you know,

421
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,050
I know what I'm talking about.
You know,

422
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:14,790
I'm,
I'm,

423
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,820
I reached the point in my life where I 
don't really feel like I'm not,

424
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:18,803
I stopped working hard at trying to make
people feel comfortable if they can't 

425
00:24:22,231 --> 00:24:23,930
accept me on my own terms,
just to,

426
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,773
you know,
they'll see shortly that it's cool and 

427
00:24:27,271 --> 00:24:29,300
if they don't,
then there's nothing I,

428
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,880
nothing I write or play or do is going 
to make them feel comfortable anyway.

429
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,343
So I didn't have that problem when I was
working with David and Eric overmeyer 

430
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,230
tiny he seen and Taylor branch,
right?

431
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,123
They were just cool.
We were all there for the same purpose 

432
00:24:43,411 --> 00:24:44,700
and I really liked them all.

433
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,173
And I ended in early,
earlier mix tape with a spontaneous 

434
00:24:51,941 --> 00:24:54,160
monologue from one of my favorite 
writers,

435
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,720
Howitt and rapper kate tempest.
But the whole conversation with her,

436
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:02,980
it was incredibly illuminating.
She had just finished her first novel,

437
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,023
the bricks that built the houses.
And here she talks fascinatingly about 

438
00:25:08,861 --> 00:25:09,694
writer's block.
The surprise clip is from author 

439
00:25:12,371 --> 00:25:15,340
Augusten burroughs.
He's talking about writer's block,

440
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:20,050
which he believes is a real thing and 
we'll see how kate responds to that.

441
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:30,250
The worst thing to do with writer's 
block is kind of like the worst thing to

442
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:32,810
do with back pain.
You know,

443
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:33,644
if you have back pain,
you don't want to stay in bed for the 

444
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:36,434
next five years.
You know you need to begin physical 

445
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:39,404
therapy.
You need to maybe do yoga or 

446
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:44,000
[inaudible].
You need to move with writer's block.

447
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,550
You don't stay away from the writing and
think,

448
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:47,983
I'll wait until the solution comes to me
because that's not how it works for a 

449
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:53,744
writer.
The solution comes to us as we're 

450
00:25:56,151 --> 00:25:58,670
writing.
It comes mid sentence.

451
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:03,590
The solution to writer's block is to 
write about the writer's block.

452
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,050
Why don't you have it?
Why does it suck?

453
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,063
Really,
why it could be a case of you knows 

454
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,280
you're off plot.
We're off point.

455
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,290
It could be that there's something 
deeper,

456
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,213
better,
truer jucier that you really need to 

457
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:17,570
write about that maybe you're too 
embarrassed to write.

458
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,100
I'm of the opinion that there is no such
thing as writer's block.

459
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,173
I don't think it exists.
I think that there is the fear of 

460
00:26:28,061 --> 00:26:29,290
writing badly.
That's,

461
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,010
that's what it is.
And if you're afraid of writing badly,

462
00:26:32,011 --> 00:26:35,140
then and you're not going to be writing 
because it's a,

463
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,620
it's a crippling fear that,
but you just have to take that fear away

464
00:26:38,621 --> 00:26:40,450
from it until you saw the flower.
I love this shit today.

465
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:41,750
It doesn't matter.
Right?

466
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:46,350
It doesn't matter if it's good like 
because the point of it is right.

467
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,240
Anyone can have an idea anybody but 
finishing an ideas what I'm saying?

468
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,990
That's the agony.
That's difficult.

469
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,460
It's always difficult.
It's fucking hard work and apologies for

470
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:59,100
swearing,
but the point is,

471
00:26:59,101 --> 00:26:59,934
is that like you're,
you're kind of in competition with 

472
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:03,690
yourself already because you're trying 
to improve.

473
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,970
You're trying to be better tomorrow than
you were yesterday.

474
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,850
That's one thing.
But having an idea,

475
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,050
beautiful,
perfect.

476
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:10,651
It's going to be,
you know,

477
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:12,510
it's going to change the world.
That's going to be the best thing you've

478
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:15,450
ever done to the actual finished thing 
is going to be clunky.

479
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,270
You're going to be ashamed of it.
You're going to pick it apart.

480
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:19,410
We're getting,
you can't get to sleep.

481
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:20,790
You're going to hate yourself for doing 
it.

482
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,313
That's the point.
That's why you move on and have another 

483
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:25,290
idea.
You finish things,

484
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,750
you finished things.
The stepping stones towards finding your

485
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:30,660
voice.
It's like on on a writing day.

486
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,760
If I don't feel,
if it's not happening,

487
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:33,990
if it's not coming out,
I don't,

488
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,420
I don't force it.
I take a walk,

489
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:37,254
like I stopped,
like I'm in a slightly different 

490
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:40,014
situation because I'm usually,
I'm usually quite up against it with 

491
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:43,164
deadlines.
So I wrote the majority of this has it 

492
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,590
fixed,
it built the houses,

493
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,180
kind of what I was on the road.

494
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,660
Sorry.
So in a tour bus full of other people?

495
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,523
Yeah,
and it's all boss or in a cafe or in a 

496
00:27:53,981 --> 00:27:54,814
service station or like in the three 
days I had off between tours in my 

497
00:27:58,111 --> 00:27:58,944
bedroom or whatever it was like,
and the thing is like you can make all 

498
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:06,600
kinds of excuses that you can say,
oh I need some space and I need time and

499
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,434
I need natural light.
And I need a room with a view and I 

500
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:12,120
need,
or you can just,

501
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,160
you know,
you can just finish it.

502
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,590
It's really hard,
but it's what,

503
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,483
it's what will make you better.
Say you don't take a walk and say you 

504
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:25,050
sit down and you make yourself right one
day and it comes out and it's shit.

505
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,140
You delete it.
Do you rewrite it?

506
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,510
It depends what you're working on.
So I feel if I'm working on a play,

507
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,630
you can hear,
you can feel when it's a bad line,

508
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,680
it's suddenly you're like,
what?

509
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,740
Nobody would ever say that about this 
character would never say that.

510
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,383
But the thing is when,
when I'm up against the deadline or 

511
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,173
usually it's,
I'm under a lot of pressure because of 

512
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:47,070
my schedule because I mean that's the 
way I work and I'm happy about it.

513
00:28:47,071 --> 00:28:47,904
It's good for me.
But sometimes there isn't time to be 

514
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:54,050
having an off day and that's like,
it's crazy pressure but it works.

515
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,933
Sometimes it works.
Other times I'm in a really great 

516
00:28:57,331 --> 00:29:00,390
situation because writing can be quite 
lonely pursuit.

517
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:02,490
But then when you have an editor or in 
music,

518
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,324
I have a great music producer who I work
with or what are making theater or I 

519
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:06,354
have the director,
I worked with a director and there were 

520
00:29:08,261 --> 00:29:09,094
these other people,
these kind of midwives that populate a 

521
00:29:10,891 --> 00:29:15,150
writer's life that help you to kind of 
get over yourself enough to just kind of

522
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:16,020
deliver it,
you know?

523
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,670
And um,
you know,

524
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:18,421
with,
with this,

525
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:19,680
for example,
with the bricks,

526
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,820
the most exhilarating part of this 
process was deleting 30,000

527
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:28,821
words and feeling how good that was.
Like suddenly it got lighter and it kind

528
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:31,050
of held its shape a bit more 
successfully.

529
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:34,380
And I could just feel this thing that 
I'd only ever heard writers talk about,

530
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:35,214
but I'd never experienced,
which is like the kind of joy of just 

531
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:38,520
cutting,
cutting,

532
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,413
cutting,
cutting and just watching it kind of 

533
00:29:40,741 --> 00:29:41,750
grow.
Yeah.

534
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,510
Really interesting.
So yeah,

535
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,513
shout out loud as shit.
It'll stay there for a bit and then you 

536
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:48,880
lose it.
It's all right,

537
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:49,190
you know?

538
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,023
Yeah.
So it sounds like a big part of your 

539
00:29:51,261 --> 00:29:53,840
process is kind of the gun to your head,
like just saying,

540
00:29:53,841 --> 00:29:54,674
basically I got to get this done and 
putting yourself in a position where 

541
00:29:56,901 --> 00:29:57,734
that's the case.

542
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,653
Yeah.
And even before when there wasn't 

543
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:00,424
deadlines,
when I have no publisher or anything 

544
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:02,704
else,
I was still inflicting that kind of 

545
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:07,930
pressure on myself because I've always 
felt that time is kind of against me.

546
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,400
I don't know why then if he feel like 
that.

547
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,110
Yeah.
Well increasingly,

548
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:15,340
but uh,
for me it was interesting because I,

549
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,983
I grew up relatively privileged and had 
the privilege slash curse of being able 

550
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:22,204
to kind of wander around and like,
it took me longer to feel that the gun 

551
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:27,440
of time to my head.
Yeah.

552
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,070
And I mean,
I don't know much about your background,

553
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:33,790
but um,
I know from the fact that so much of the

554
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:34,624
press is about your being from southeast
London and the neighborhood that you 

555
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:39,760
focus on and stuff.
I'm guessing you may be,

556
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:43,420
didn't have people sending you off to 
wander around.

557
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:49,090
I didn't get some really good supportive
environment,

558
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,403
but the,
the way that south London figures in my 

559
00:30:54,201 --> 00:30:56,660
work and then in myself,
it's like,

560
00:30:56,661 --> 00:30:59,240
it's such a huge Paul.
I mean,

561
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:00,074
because if you grow up in a big city,
especially in a pot in a city that's so 

562
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:04,701
south London,
it,

563
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:07,730
okay,
so I suppose for an American audience to

564
00:31:07,731 --> 00:31:08,720
kind of say,
oh,

565
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,430
southeastern,
then it probably doesn't mean anything.

566
00:31:10,431 --> 00:31:11,030
Like,
you know,

567
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,350
unless you've spent some time and none 
of them,

568
00:31:12,351 --> 00:31:14,990
but the kind of character of it in my 
head,

569
00:31:14,991 --> 00:31:19,220
the way that it is a very creative place
in terms of people who are really making

570
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:21,550
something happen there.
I felt in my,

571
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,030
it's very mixed place culturally,
racially,

572
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,133
and economically,
lots of different people live in very 

573
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:29,624
close together.
There's a certain sensibility that it 

574
00:31:31,191 --> 00:31:33,020
gives you if you're from there,
which is,

575
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,760
it's quite a rough area.

576
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:35,763
It was like the highest,
the highest rates of teenage pregnancy 

577
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:41,180
and murder amongst teenagers when I was 
growing up in Lewisham,

578
00:31:41,181 --> 00:31:42,350
which is the borrower,
I'll go up,

579
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,483
but at the same time there's a huge 
amount of music and huge amount of 

580
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,713
amazing,
vibrant creativity and I found it to be 

581
00:31:50,731 --> 00:31:54,120
a really positive place.
I grew up in a very good home.

582
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,300
My Dad was a lawyer,
my mom was a teacher.

583
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,480
We just lived in this area that was like
full of full of life,

584
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:00,314
you know,
it was just full of life and every time 

585
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,100
I walked out of the door and down the 
street,

586
00:32:04,101 --> 00:32:07,470
every time I ever went anywhere,
I would pass by thousands if not fucking

587
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,530
tens of thousands of people because it's
London,

588
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:13,310
it's a big city,
and I just always felt so close to life,

589
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,330
you know,
it was just everywhere.

590
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,820
And that I have a huge love for people 
like the rubber,

591
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,663
not so obvious to say,
but I'm really moved by just like being 

592
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:27,080
amongst strangers and feeling connected 
to their humanity and feeling this thing

593
00:32:27,081 --> 00:32:28,110
I'm talking about earlier.

594
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:32,420
What about this kind of current reality 
that we are denied access to?

595
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,853
I think there is something about a kind 
of a frequency that our rights are 

596
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:39,140
exists on looking for the kind of 
looking,

597
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,630
the internal experience of strangers.
You know,

598
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,420
I don't really know why,
but yeah,

599
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,610
I watched somebody walk down the street 
and the way that they're carrying their,

600
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:47,683
their car keys,
something about the way they just 

601
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:49,784
dropped their shopping bag.
Like I feel so blown away by a tiny 

602
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:52,940
movement,
right?

603
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:57,470
They kind of sends me into this like 
deep passion for these people,

604
00:32:57,471 --> 00:32:58,220
you know,
for,

605
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,053
for somebody.
And I think that the writer is 

606
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:02,300
constantly feeling kind of outside of 
life,

607
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,000
which is what sends us to the page 
often,

608
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,863
you know,
trying to write ourselves into this 

609
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,410
existence that we were kind of 
constantly because we observed so much I

610
00:33:11,411 --> 00:33:12,244
kind of outside of things.
But the observation is one of like pure 

611
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:15,464
love.
Really.

612
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,161
Yeah.
I got,

613
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,530
I got lost in south London and I found 
myself there but you know,

614
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,150
got into all kinds of trouble and all 
kinds of like beautiful,

615
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:23,984
beautiful things happened.
And I still live there and it's still 

616
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:26,440
home.

617
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,273
You know in the book there's,
you talk about gentrification and 

618
00:33:30,451 --> 00:33:31,284
there's this sense,
I mean it seems like you feel like the 

619
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,993
heart of south London is still intact,
but that there's this threat somehow of 

620
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,590
it being co opted or,

621
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,070
yeah.
It's strange because the,

622
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:50,590
I think it's more helpful because this 
conversation about gentrification,

623
00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:53,740
it happens all over the world and it's a
tragedy.

624
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,723
But the minute where I've been thinking 
about it is it's more useful actually 

625
00:33:57,051 --> 00:34:01,240
need to pan out of this a little bit and
think about what this means it in a kind

626
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:02,074
of why the framework,
which is this kind of symptomatic greed 

627
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:10,080
and the exploitation of land for profit 
above people and this year you could,

628
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,050
okay,
yes,

629
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,453
it's,
it's a real shame shaft on this 

630
00:34:13,931 --> 00:34:14,830
changing.
My God,

631
00:34:14,831 --> 00:34:15,664
it hurts.
But if we pan out a little bit and we 

632
00:34:17,261 --> 00:34:20,860
think about land,
land is being exploited for profit,

633
00:34:20,861 --> 00:34:22,840
the people that live on that land are 
being destroyed.

634
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:24,490
The community is that culture has been 
destroyed.

635
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:27,520
This isn't just happening in cities,
it's just happening all over the world.

636
00:34:27,521 --> 00:34:28,354
It's happening to the first Australians.
It's happening in the rainforest and 

637
00:34:30,221 --> 00:34:30,650
primitive,
you know,

638
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:34,390
it's like there is a greed that is 
running,

639
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,110
running the world.
Yeah,

640
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,000
it's greed.
There's no empathy and I

641
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,553
alienation happens not only to the 
communities that are destroyed but to 

642
00:34:44,941 --> 00:34:46,740
the destroyers as well.
I mean,

643
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:47,603
I just think that the world that is 
built up upon the wreckage of these 

644
00:34:51,571 --> 00:34:52,404
communities is also a world in which 
it's difficult to form community like 

645
00:34:56,401 --> 00:34:57,234
new communities.

646
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,250
There are,
I don't know.

647
00:34:58,251 --> 00:34:59,210
I mean,
I don't know.

648
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,900
I've never lived in a,
I don't know.

649
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,750
I think that like this has to go both 
ways.

650
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,520
So if I say that,
you know,

651
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:10,130
I love people and I'm,
I'm for people,

652
00:35:10,131 --> 00:35:13,040
I can't be just for people that I 
already agree with,

653
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,280
like this has to go both ways.
You have to,

654
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,110
recently I've been thinking,
okay,

655
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:22,130
so you need to empower even the very 
powerful to be more real with themselves

656
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,973
that actually think about the cost.
The only thing I can think to say is 

657
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:29,630
just empathy.
It does need more empathy.

658
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,910
It's very easy for artists,

659
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,053
a buddy to basically cut themselves off 
from all the rest of that humanity and 

660
00:35:36,211 --> 00:35:39,870
find some way to people and say like,
oh,

661
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,020
that person is to,
you know,

662
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,900
that's a greedy corporate person,
or that's a this person or that,

663
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:46,763
you know what I mean?
Like I think it's hard for anyone to to 

664
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:52,410
remind themselves and try to figure out 
how to like

665
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:57,790
not shutoff difficult because part of me
just recoils and kind of wishes that the

666
00:35:58,971 --> 00:36:01,780
world was kind of run by these reptilian
monsters.

667
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,313
The reality is that the human beings are
human beings that are making these 

668
00:36:05,961 --> 00:36:06,794
decisions.
And so at the beginning of this 

669
00:36:08,571 --> 00:36:10,040
conversation we were talking about,
you know,

670
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:10,874
whether this kind of grappling between 
what we're capable of and what we are 

671
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,213
inherent nature is.
And actually what I believe that 

672
00:36:18,411 --> 00:36:21,290
inherently we are physiologically 
empathic beings.

673
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:21,870
Right.
That was,

674
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,703
that was a study that that took place 
where I learned about this in the 

675
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,240
Science Museum in London.
So I know it's true,

676
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,250
right?
So they took two strangers,

677
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,780
put them in a,
in a room,

678
00:36:32,781 --> 00:36:33,614
separated by a glass partition.
And one of them stood on a block of ice 

679
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,593
and the temperature of the others,
the temperature of the other person's 

680
00:36:41,181 --> 00:36:45,770
feet dropped in response to watching 
another human being who they didn't know

681
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:46,604
stand on a block of ice.
Like our bodies are chained into each 

682
00:36:48,741 --> 00:36:51,650
other's.
It's like if I see like I see your wound

683
00:36:51,651 --> 00:36:52,940
on you,
I will recoil,

684
00:36:52,941 --> 00:36:54,350
it will hurt me at some level.
Right.

685
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,683
We have to learn.
People have to learn not to be able to 

686
00:36:58,061 --> 00:36:58,894
do that,
you know?

687
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,420
Right.
Yeah.

688
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,253
But so like,
but we've kind of fed this thing about 

689
00:37:02,731 --> 00:37:06,720
Humana being this like inherently like 
aggressive,

690
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:08,730
competitive,
selfish.

691
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,913
I don't believe that.
I think that that is something that has 

692
00:37:11,971 --> 00:37:15,030
encouraged this kind of myth of the 
individual,

693
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,270
which is very helpful for capitalism,
but not very helpful for humanity.

694
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,490
You know?
I mean fierce

695
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,710
to be a pretty strong forest within 
humanity as well.

696
00:37:23,711 --> 00:37:26,380
And it seems to me that a lot of this 
stuff arises from fear,

697
00:37:26,381 --> 00:37:27,190
right?
I mean,

698
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:30,210
the primal fear goes all the way back,
right?

699
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:30,671
I mean,
we're,

700
00:37:30,671 --> 00:37:32,170
we're afraid of death,
you know,

701
00:37:32,171 --> 00:37:34,000
is probably where it begins.
I don't know.

702
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:37,150
But fear of scarcity,
fear of whatever,

703
00:37:37,151 --> 00:37:40,080
like fear of somebody taking what's 
ours.

704
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,370
I don't know.
I think it's probably pretty old.

705
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:42,960
Yeah,
I'm,

706
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,550
no,
I'm with the you and I think,

707
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,910
I think yes of course.
But like once you are,

708
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:50,460
sounds so kind of far fetched and also 
so easy.

709
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:53,160
But this is kind of where I'm at at the 
minute is if you're,

710
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,023
if you're there,
if you're present with yourself and 

711
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,110
suddenly like the,
the worry of things,

712
00:37:58,111 --> 00:37:58,944
the anxiety of things to come.
This is not important because you're 

713
00:38:00,561 --> 00:38:01,650
just,
you're just where you are,

714
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:03,840
you know,
and you can deal with it when it comes.

715
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:06,960
But I don't know.
I don't know.

716
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,120
I'm a sudden he was about to say 
something extremely kind of new agey and

717
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,640
I stopped myself.
I still feel something else.

718
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,390
Okay,
good.

719
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,223
Next subject.

720
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,950
And that's it for this.
Think again,

721
00:38:22,951 --> 00:38:23,784
mixed tape,
which I'm calling the writer's room 

722
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,873
gathering some of the most poignant and 
interesting advice that I've heard some 

723
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:35,040
writers on writing over the past year.
If you're listening and liking the,

724
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,040
you're probably sick of

725
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,873
hearing me say it,
and I wish that I could personally 

726
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:39,934
remove this message from all the future 
episodes of everyone who has gone and 

727
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:45,580
done this.
But at any rate,

728
00:38:45,581 --> 00:38:46,414
I can't.
If you could go and read or review the 

729
00:38:49,781 --> 00:38:51,940
show on Itunes,
stitcher,

730
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:52,923
wherever it is you're listening,
it really doesn't take very long and it 

731
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:59,590
makes a major difference in terms of the
shows sustainability.

732
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,010
We have an amazing season coming up now 
that it's fall,

733
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,600
and I hope to see you next week.
