00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,640
For any problem your work on this,
a moment where the sort of maybe it's

2
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:15,910
some model that no one else cares about
where it's sort of all fit together and

3
00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:17,650
I found some simple way of doing
something.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,960
There's also the models that people have
heard about,

5
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:22,420
some such as the models about extra
dimensions,

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,700
something else that we did having to do
with a different way of communicating.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,930
Supersymmetry breaking.
There were a lot of fuel rica moments in

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,990
that making it work out.
Um,

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,890
and the fact that we could all tied
together.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,190
So it's hard for me to pull this out
because a lot of the time when you're

11
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:39,730
working on something that's that one
thing that you get excited about.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,630
I think one thing that surprised us a
ramen and I when we were working

13
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:51,320
together was the existence of the
possibility of the existence of an

14
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:52,940
infinite extra dimension.
Um,

15
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,800
you know,
people had actually thought there were

16
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:57,950
theorems that you couldn't have an
infant extra dimension that gravity

17
00:00:57,951 --> 00:01:00,260
would just look wrong.
That there was no consistent way to do

18
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,570
it.
And it was really interesting because we

19
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:05,950
came across this by working really
following the consequence of our

20
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,340
equations to the end and there was just
no mistaking that it was allowing the

21
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:13,430
possibility of if an extra dimension.
And it was interesting to go back and

22
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:18,410
see what assumptions have been made that
made us think or make other people think

23
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,620
that it wasn't possible.
And just to see how the theory was

24
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:23,570
almost smarter than we were in and
worked it out.

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,560
So that was kind of fun.
