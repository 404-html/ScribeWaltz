1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,100
So as an entrepreneur,
as a ted and Tedx speaker,

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,060
as an award winning author,
and as someone who was named USA Today's

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,140
most connected millennial,
a lot of people ask me how I have built

4
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,030
my network and how I connect with
people.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,610
And so I'll give you the high level and
then I'll go into maybe a few specifics

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,740
that you can use today to build a world
class network in record time.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,760
At a high level,
I would think about networking in,

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,010
in three basic steps.
Step one,

9
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:35,610
which shouldn't even have to be told or
shared,

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,140
is that you should be a good person in
the whole process of building your

11
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:43,260
relationship,
which is probably easy at first.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,271
Uh,
you,

13
00:00:44,271 --> 00:00:46,620
you bump into someone at a coffee shop,
run an event.

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,900
Obviously you want to treat them with
respect.

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,180
Treat them like you would treat your mom
is,

16
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:52,890
uh,
something I was told recently that I

17
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:57,000
really like a [inaudible] shows like the
level of respect that you should have

18
00:00:57,001 --> 00:01:00,720
for someone regardless of who they look
like or who they are.

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,760
Uh,
anything like that.

20
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,620
Just treat everyone the same,
uh,

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,760
be a good person and if you're,
if you're coming at it being a good

22
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:13,590
person instead of being selfish or
trying to win a quick contract over

23
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:15,990
someone,
I think you'll have a much better job

24
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,400
longterm,
uh,

25
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,840
in terms of building your network and as
you become a super connector,

26
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,640
uh,
you're going to want to be more

27
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:26,820
intentional about how you spend your
time and so they're going be more people

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,010
reaching out to you,
trying to connect with you,

29
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:32,700
and it's important to treat them
respectfully and be a good person with

30
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,370
maybe someone who is less knowledgeable
than you reaching out.

31
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,980
Even if you can't spend a lot of time
with them,

32
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:41,040
there's a respectful way to say no,
or there's a respectful way to,

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,380
uh,
talk to anyone regardless of if you end

34
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:44,430
up spending time with them or not.

35
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,600
So,
step one,

36
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:49,320
be a good person.
A step two is to provide value upfront.

37
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,500
Uh,
as you are building friendships,

38
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:55,950
connecting with people,
it's important to ask about what they

39
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:59,940
care about and what they're working on
and what's keeping them up at night.

40
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,620
See if you can offer connections,
are offered time or resources in order

41
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:08,910
to move their agenda forward,
and this is the same in marketing.

42
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:13,230
You want to offer a potential customer
value before you try and ask them for

43
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:15,000
money or ask them for value.
In return.

44
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,580
It's the same with sales.
You have to build rapport and really

45
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:20,820
establish a relationship,
but it's important with mentors as well

46
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:25,821
because a lot of times if you're
reaching out to find a mentor or you're

47
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:29,100
reaching out to a,
someone important in your industry,

48
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,630
they're fielding a lot of the same sort
of requests from other individuals who

49
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:38,100
want their time and want their expertise
and so you could stand out by looking to

50
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:42,210
offer value to them and actually being
proactive about what it is they're

51
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:43,044
working on.

52
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,040
A,
for example,

53
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:47,970
I've reached out to New York Times
bestselling authors right before they're

54
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:51,660
about to come out with another book and
so I know that they are looking for

55
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,350
introductions to press.
I know that they are really busy and so

56
00:02:55,351 --> 00:03:00,190
anything I can do to help them advance
the book that they're working on or save

57
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:03,820
them time is really valuable to them.
And so I would think about,

58
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,000
uh,
you know,

59
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,840
always being a good person,
providing value upfront.

60
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,730
And then number three is being
intentional about who you're trying to

61
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,270
build relationships with.
That level of intentionality I think is

62
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:18,250
missing for a lot of us in today's Day
and age.

63
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:22,330
There's so much noise coming at us and
so many pings coming through our

64
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,650
smartphone,
uh,

65
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,070
but if you're looking to build a world
class network and do it in a short

66
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:29,950
amount of time,
then you have to be intentional about

67
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:31,750
what types of people you want in your
network,

68
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,890
who you want to learn from,
uh,

69
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,500
and how you're going to give yourself
access to different networks.

70
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,330
And so for me,
uh,

71
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:44,170
I like to spend as much time as possible
with people that are super connectors,

72
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,690
meaning they are well regarded in their
industry.

73
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,220
They have high integrity and they're
also in a hub or an access point to a

74
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:52,930
bunch of other people.
In their industry,

75
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,420
and so I know,
you know,

76
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,300
two or three Olympians and if I ever had
a reason to reach out to more Olympians,

77
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,430
I would go through those two or three
individuals,

78
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:02,530
but I was a good person and meeting
them,

79
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:06,090
I provided them value upfront and now
you know,

80
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,770
I have a friendship with them that
allows me access to a bunch of other

81
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:11,260
Olympians.
And same with the world of authors.

82
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:14,080
Same with a lot of fortune 500 c suite
executives.

83
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:17,380
I know they all know each other.
And so if you can build a relationship

84
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:21,850
with people who are super connectors,
they give you access to a lot of other

85
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:24,100
people in their network if and when you
need it.

86
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:27,730
And then if and when you can provide
value to people in their network and you

87
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:29,470
know,
along the way you've gotta make sure

88
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:32,080
you're a good person and keep your
reputation solid.

89
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,910
Uh,
so at a high level,

90
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:38,520
that's how I would go about thinking
about networking,

91
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,190
relationship building.
