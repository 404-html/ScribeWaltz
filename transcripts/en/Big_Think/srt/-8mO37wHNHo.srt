1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,593
Well,
I don't think it necessarily has value 

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:05,790
for everyone then.
I'm not one of these people.

3
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:08,790
He said you should get on twitter and 
everybody should have a twitter account.

4
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:09,624
I know,
I can tell you what's interesting about 

5
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:16,150
it for me is,
um,

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,123
people can elect to follow writers and 
thinkers and speakers they are 

7
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:27,360
interested in and you can elect to 
follow the back or not.

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:28,973
And so for me it's,
it's a great way to build a network of 

9
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:35,010
people who are interested in my work,
friends of my ideas.

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,383
So that's what the people who follow me 
on twitter or are there friends of my 

11
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:43,671
ideas and I can talk to them through 
this network as they listened to me,

12
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:48,030
but also a lot of other people at the 
same time.

13
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:52,510
So I have a small part in their feed.
Um,

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,680
which is fine because I'm one of many 
voices at listening to.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,753
So that's what twitter is.
It's your own network of people who 

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,840
follow what you do and say,

17
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,853
okay,

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,090
well I'm learning twitter.
I'm in my first few months doing it.

19
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,530
And so I'm doing lots of things that 
just help me understand,

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,460
um,
the form and a lot of them are just,

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,690
um,
probes.

22
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:22,490
They're just,
um,

23
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,013
uh,
playing around 10 green as it were with 

24
00:01:26,061 --> 00:01:27,660
something new.
Um,

25
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,650
but I use it the way other people do in 
that.

26
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,973
Um,
the people I follow are constantly 

27
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:36,230
posting links and ideas about stuff that
I want to keep up with.

28
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,980
Um,
when I find something that I think would

29
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,990
interest the kind of people who read my 
blog or who follow my arguments,

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,080
I post it here something new.
I post questions to my followers,

31
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,520
I push out news of my work as it,
um,

32
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,553
up here is around the web.
And I also get a kind of a real time 

33
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:05,120
reaction to things going on in the news 
that really interests me,

34
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,983
especially in the media is,
and in the whole realm of alternative 

35
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:11,594
media,
new media.

36
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,980
These are things that I follow with a 
passion.

37
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,240
And so it's keeping me in touch.
It's filtering the web for me.

38
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,630
It's,
um,

39
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,513
reading the newspaper for me.
And it's also a group of people who I 

40
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:31,511
trust with my ideas,
both in finished form and in the kind of

41
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:34,664
tentative grope me that you do when 
you're trying to figure out your 

42
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:43,931
reaction to things like the saddleback 
forum where Mccain and Obama appeared in

43
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,270
last week.
Right.

44
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,440
Uh,
and so it's,

45
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,470
it's part of living in a world of 
information with really expert guides.

46
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,630
That's twitter for me.
