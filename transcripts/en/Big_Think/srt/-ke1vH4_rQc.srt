1
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,290
If you look at our current technological
systems near our minds are they are very

2
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:12,780
different.
And one of the biggest questions for me

3
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:16,080
is what's the difference between where
we are now and where we need to be.

4
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:18,720
If you want to build mines,
if you want to build systems that are

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,080
generally intelligent and self motivated
and maybe self aware.

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,430
And of course the answer to this we
don't know because if you knew we

7
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:28,370
already done it,
but uh,

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,680
there are basically several perspectives
on this.

9
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:36,360
One is our minds as general learning
systems that are able to waddle

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,510
arbitrary things including themselves.
And if they are this,

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,540
they probably need a very distinct set
of motivations,

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,160
needs,
um,

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,730
things that they want to do.
And I think that humans get their

14
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:51,480
specifics due to their particular needs.
We have cognitive and social and

15
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:54,120
physiological needs and they turn us on
who we are.

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,020
Our motivations determine what,
where we put our attention to and what

17
00:00:58,021 --> 00:00:59,820
you learned and what we actually do in
the world.

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,610
But you model.
How about we perceive what are your

19
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:07,350
conscious of in a similar sense it might
be that it's sufficient to build a

20
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:10,620
genuine learning architecture and
combined this is a good motivational

21
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:12,930
system in beer,
not there yet that we have built a

22
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:15,060
genuine learning architecture.
For instance,

23
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:17,910
our minds can learn and create new
algorithms.

24
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,330
They can be used to write code and
invent code programming code for

25
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,180
instance,
or the rules that you need to build the

26
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:26,610
shop and ran their chop.
If you were a shopkeeper,

27
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:29,220
which is some kind of programming task
in its own right.

28
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,070
We don't know how to build a system that
is able to do this yet.

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,920
It involves,
for instance,

30
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:37,890
that we have systems that are able to
learn loops and you have some techniques

31
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:38,400
to do this.

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,830
For instance,
a long short term memory and a few other

33
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:43,530
tricks,
but they are nowhere near of what people

34
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:48,230
can do so far and it's not quite clear
how much work needs to be done to extend

35
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,680
these systems into what people can do.
It could be that it's very simple.

36
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:55,020
It could be that it's going to take a
lot of research,

37
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,080
the dire view,
and this was more the traditional view

38
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:01,500
is that human minds have a lot of also
going our complexity that you need to

39
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:06,501
build a lot of functionality into it,
like in Minsky Society of mind to get to

40
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:11,910
all the tricks that people are up to.
And if that is the case then it might

41
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:13,220
take a very long time.
I had to do,

42
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:15,690
we have,
we created all these different financial

43
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:18,120
mechanisms,
but I don't think that it's going to be

44
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:22,020
so dire because our genome is very short
and most of that codes for the single

45
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:24,300
cell,
very little of it codes for the brain.

46
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,880
And I think a sale is much more
complicated than a brain.

47
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,150
A brain is probably largely self
organizing and build,

48
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,510
not like clockwork,
but like a couple of Chino.

49
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,510
So you'll mix the right ingredients and
then you let it percolate and then forms

50
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:40,230
a particular kind of structure.
So I do think because nature of pulls it

51
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:42,870
off pretty well in most of the cases
that,

52
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,870
um,
even though brain probably needs more

53
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:48,090
complexity than a Cappuccino,
dramatically more,

54
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,650
it's going to be much simpler than
building a very complicated machine like

55
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:53,010
a cell.
