00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,170
In China,
there are basically two major issues.

2
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:12,730
The first issue is that there is not a
lot of intellectual property enforcement

3
00:00:12,731 --> 00:00:17,731
on the streets or in the web rooms on,
so there's a that you can find pirated

4
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:23,761
material all over China and there's not
been a very effective way of enforcing

5
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:25,660
that.
We're working on that,

6
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:27,040
but it's very,
very slow.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,170
The second problem is market access.
The Chinese were severely restrict the

8
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:35,320
amount of foreign product,
including American product,

9
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:38,020
a film product that comes into China
illegally,

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,860
and I'm not only is that bad in and of
itself,

11
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:46,630
but then encourages more pirated
material to to be on the streets because

12
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:50,590
you can find almost anything that has
ever been produced in the history of the

13
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:53,500
human race in China that's on the
streets illegally.
