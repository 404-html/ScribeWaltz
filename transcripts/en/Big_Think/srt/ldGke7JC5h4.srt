1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,740
Yeah,

2
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,850
well I think first of all,
if we didn't have electronic

3
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:20,810
applications that you wouldn't see quite
that same kind of growth.

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,960
I think a second of all is that,
uh,

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,380
that I,
I see that as a good sign because those,

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:32,540
those institutions are a recognized as
being.

7
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,870
Institutions have great excellence
worldwide excellence.

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,080
So if more and more students think of
themselves as world class scholars,

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,880
uh,
it's great that there's that many kids

10
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:46,760
that want to go out to the very best
schools.

11
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,050
Uh,
when I,

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,140
when I talked to parents and students,
what I emphasize is there's so many

13
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:59,591
great schools in America and is a
minister told me once when I was quite

14
00:01:00,171 --> 00:01:05,171
young and he was talking about the
people that came to him for advice.

15
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,900
He said,
I told him there is not a college or

16
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:13,901
university you go to that you can learn
all they have to teach you.

17
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,950
So I believe that we have a great number
of great institutions in this country

18
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:23,210
and your future doesn't depend upon
going to the very best that people can

19
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:25,250
get a great education.
And,

20
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,200
uh,
if you look at people that are

21
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:30,890
successful in this country,
not all of them have gone.

22
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:34,850
Certainly many of them haven't gone to
what we would consider the most elite

23
00:01:34,851 --> 00:01:35,510
schools in the school.
