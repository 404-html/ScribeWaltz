1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,420
Fascinatingly,
the story of how hip hop happened is

2
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:14,310
actually the story of how innovation has
happened in kind of every dimension,

3
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:18,420
every industry you can think of,
and it's this thing called cognitive

4
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:21,570
friction.
It's the friction between different

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,280
ideas or different ways of doing
something that actually produce a path

6
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:29,880
forward that,
that helps kind of any industry become

7
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:32,730
innovative.
I was especially fascinated by the story

8
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:37,731
of the Wu Tang clan and how they did
this in particular when they got nine

9
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:41,400
guys,
nine Alpha males with big egos together

10
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:45,330
to form a rap group,
which on the face of it actually sounds

11
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:49,260
like a terrible idea.
They're different styles of rap in the

12
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,340
early sort of early days of hip hop.
We're,

13
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,480
we're kind of all over the map.
You know,

14
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:55,950
some more,
more emotional.

15
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:58,800
Others were more lyrical and they were
all very different.

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,910
And so you can just imagine the conflict
that erupts out of this.

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,760
And then they got in the record studio
together and they nearly killed each

18
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:08,250
other.
And this was because they were

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,960
essentially extensively enemies and uh,
or at least didn't have a whole lot of

20
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:16,170
trust between them.
The main guy who got them together,

21
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:19,620
his name was Robert Diggs.
He came up with this very clever plan.

22
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,110
Basically he said,
I will make a beat.

23
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,830
I'll make a song.
And then everyone has to show up and

24
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,530
compete for the song.
So you show up with your lyrics,

25
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:32,490
with your rhymes and you get on the
microphone and whoever does the best

26
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:34,530
job,
you're on the track or you're on this

27
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:36,960
part of the track.
And he did this and he basically

28
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:41,940
channeled this aggressive energy and all
of these sort of different ways of

29
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,480
operating in hip hop.
And he got them all to instead of

30
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:50,481
fighting with each other to fight for
the record and to kind of elevate this

31
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,780
music.

32
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,590
And what came out of this sort of
laboratory as like Adam smashing

33
00:01:55,591 --> 00:02:00,450
together and creating this great heat in
this great energy and out of this was

34
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:02,910
born the greatest hip hop group of all
time.

35
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:06,990
That many consider it that.
And this is actually exactly what

36
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:11,991
happened with hip hop in general.
Hip Hop started with Djs throwing these

37
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:14,820
parties where everyone who showed up to
the party,

38
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,850
you danced on one side of the dance hall
or the other,

39
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:19,530
depending on which music you like the
best.

40
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:23,550
So the djs would bring different music
every week to try and lower the party to

41
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:26,430
their side or the other.
And this is some sort of fun party game.

42
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,740
And what happened is when the DJ's
announcers started competing over the

43
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:34,890
best way to sort of drag people to their
side of the party,

44
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,570
suddenly that turned into a battle where
week after week the announcers,

45
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:43,710
the MCS would try and come up with more
clever things to say.

46
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,960
And it eventually turned into this kind
of war of words and music.

47
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,980
And in fact also a war of dance.
And what was awesome about it is

48
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:55,980
everyone was in it for the party for
making this party better,

49
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,280
making this event awesome.
And people started bringing tape

50
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:04,480
recorders to record this music that was
being invented essentially on the spot.

51
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,190
Because it was so great and you didn't
show up to this party next week after

52
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:12,610
having lost the lyric battle with the
same lyrics,

53
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,890
you showed up with something different
and in fact,

54
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:18,070
all of the djs started hacking their
equipment so they could do more clever

55
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:20,800
things.
This is how we invented fader switches

56
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,350
and,
and things that are now standard stock

57
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:27,610
for any kind of Dj or any kind of party.
They also cracked open their equipment

58
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:30,700
and added more memory when they started
doing electronic music so that they

59
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,130
could have an edge in this battle.

60
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,820
And you know,
recently Jay z was interviewed by,

61
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,420
um,
by David letterman about these days and

62
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:45,421
he said that it was all about making
this experience awesome for the people

63
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:48,730
who showed up that night.
It wasn't about killing the other guys,

64
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:50,830
even if you're,
your lyrics were about making fun of the

65
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,780
other guys.
It was about providing a great

66
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,620
atmosphere.
And so this battle elevated this whole

67
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,820
thing and out of it was born hip hop and
rnb and you know,

68
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:02,560
all of the music that's sort of stemmed
from that.

69
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:05,860
All the culture that stemmed from that,
and that's the same thing that happened

70
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:08,500
with the Wu Tang clan.
They cleverly channeled all of these

71
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,640
different kind of approaches to the
music and made something better,

72
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,930
and I think that this is an analogy that
you can not only see in the history of

73
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:20,440
innovation in science and art and
business and politics,

74
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,460
but an analogy for what we should shoot
for in our own work,

75
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,730
for how we can get better.
That the friction that the different

76
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:30,400
approaches doing battle and smashing
together.

77
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,270
If we can make sure that they don't go
too far or we turn it into something,

78
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:39,271
it's about destroying someone else.
If we think of it all as part of our

79
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,590
collaboration process to elevate our
craft,

80
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,800
then we can go much further than we
think we can on our own.
