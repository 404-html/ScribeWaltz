1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,560
I resist the notion that somehow China
is special or different from every other

2
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:15,180
country,
except in the obvious sense that every

3
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:19,620
country has some unique characteristics
in terms of Chinese history.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,170
I know,
I think perhaps a lot of people in the

5
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:27,171
West don't realize that you only have to
go back to about 1800 to find that China

6
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:32,340
was the largest economy in the world and
its per capita income was not

7
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:34,350
significantly different from western
Europe.

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,470
You know,
so China was a major economic power.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,850
China was a developed country.
If you go back further to about 1400,

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,800
you know,
China had a major navy.

11
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:46,390
It was exploring as far as Africa.
Uh,

12
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,770
so you know,
China was a global power throughout much

13
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:53,670
of history.
And then starting sometime around 1800,

14
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:55,830
we can argue about the exact date.
You know,

15
00:00:55,831 --> 00:01:00,180
China went into a period of decline
largely I think because it cut itself

16
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:01,590
off from the rest of the world.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,640
So it stopped having those benefits of
exchange with other countries,

18
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:07,120
which are,
which are important for,

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,450
for technological,
advanced and prosperity.

20
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,770
So I think Chinese people have a lot of
in a pride,

21
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,100
you know,
about their past and they're in some

22
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:19,260
sense embarrassed at the country,
you know,

23
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:23,640
really declined and became extremely
poor in the 20th century.

24
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:25,410
You know,
you had the Japanese invasion,

25
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:28,640
you had different European powers taking
little pieces of China's.

26
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:29,790
So I think,
uh,

27
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,710
you know,
I think the Chinese people have a very

28
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:36,450
strong drive to return to what they see
is their rightful place in the world,

29
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:40,590
which is a,
a major economic and cultural political

30
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:41,424
center.

31
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,460
You know,
I think Mao was fairly effective

32
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:54,461
political leader during a period where
China was trying to unify the country,

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,670
uh,
you know,

34
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,870
fight the Japanese and expelled them,
expelled the European colonial powers.

35
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,320
There's a lot of controversy about,
you know,

36
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,040
who played what role exactly.
And I'm not the best expert to,

37
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,040
to,
uh,

38
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,510
to be interviewed on the details of the
history of the 1920s in 1930s.

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,130
I think the important point is most
people in mainland China think that Mao

40
00:02:16,131 --> 00:02:20,630
played a very important role in
reunifying the country and putting

41
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:22,640
China.
That kind of first step in bringing

42
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:26,960
China back as a world power.
On the other hand,

43
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:29,900
I think most people in mainland China,
uh,

44
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,020
think that he was a very poor day to day
manager and after the country was

45
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:39,980
unified in 1949,
there was a series of quite disastrous

46
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:42,530
decisions,
mostly on the economic front.

47
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,440
You know,
the great leap forward generated a huge

48
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,960
famine in which tends of millions of
people died.

49
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,830
A cultural revolution was a disaster for
most Chinese people.

50
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,130
So I think,
uh,

51
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,800
you know,
I think it's fair to say that by the

52
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:59,210
early 1970s there was,
China certainly was extremely,

53
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,030
we know it was poor than Subsaharan
Africa and I think there was a lot of

54
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,870
resentment on the part of ordinary
people about the condition and to which

55
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:11,470
the country had fallen.
So there was a lot of popular support

56
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:15,700
for some kind of change of direction and
Dung Sao paying I think was very

57
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:18,370
effective in channeling that,
that energy,

58
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,490
you know,
and quite quickly bringing about almost

59
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:25,510
180 degree change in economic policy.
So,

60
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,360
you know,
China's really interesting laboratory in

61
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:29,171
a sense that,
you know,

62
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:31,780
the same people in the same culture,
uh,

63
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:34,810
went down a disastrous road in the
sixties and seventies,

64
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:38,410
and just got poorer and poorer and
people starve to death.

65
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,040
And then with a few key changes in
economic policy,

66
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,500
the same people,
same geography,

67
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:47,530
all of a sudden they start growing at
close to 10% per year.

68
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:51,790
So it's a very powerful example of what
you can do with economic policy.

69
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,960
Uh,
but again,

70
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:56,380
remembering that the underlying
institutions are quite important.

71
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,910
And I think China had a long history of
effective government.

72
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,720
It had pretty substantial history of
private property rights.

73
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,720
If you go back far enough,
it had a long history as a trading

74
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:10,300
power.
So I think those things reside in

75
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:13,540
people's memories.
And once in a country like China,

76
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,520
once you shift policy,
uh,

77
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,870
toward strengthening property rights and
opening up the economy,

78
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,210
you get really impressive results very
quickly.
