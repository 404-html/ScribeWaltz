1
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:14,421
I think the obstacles are the same as 
the opportunities.

2
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:15,254
It's the way we like to look at them.
We have this really powerful 

3
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:19,454
technological infrastructure that can do
really tremendous things at the same 

4
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:23,294
time.
It's never going to be as flexible as 

5
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:28,270
we'd like it to be just by nature of,
of,

6
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:30,320
of web technology.
So,

7
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,683
you know,
we can deliver news across the globe in 

8
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:34,904
a matter of seconds or minutes.
And that's pretty amazing and we can 

9
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:40,244
create a really,
really fascinating tools for our users 

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,780
to take advantage of.
Um,

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,520
at the same time,
you know,

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,740
those technologies don't allow us to,
um,

13
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,160
to,
you know,

14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,093
tool retool a,
the appearance or the presentation of 

15
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:01,610
every piece of content in exactly the 
way that we would like.

16
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:02,444
There's,
there's a real inherent limitations to 

17
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,470
the tools.
So,

18
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:07,250
um,
it's,

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,320
you know,
it's two sides of the same coin.

20
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,340
Sure.
We,

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,773
we often get reader feedback,
both positive and negative no matter 

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,670
what we do.
Um,

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,910
you know,
let me think.

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,350
Um,
there are times when,

25
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,300
um,
things that are really obvious to us,

26
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,730
you know,
and we've really tried to design them in

27
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:39,564
such a way that we think will be obvious
to readers who and users who have only 

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,900
casual familiarity with the site and 
we'll get feedback that,

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,550
that says,
you know,

30
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,410
they have no idea that,
that,

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,940
uh,
um,

32
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,030
what we intended was actually the case.
Um,

33
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,960
and I'm trying to think of an example 
off the top of my head right now.

34
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,740
Um,
you know,

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,593
we'll,
we'll occasionally add sort of 

36
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:05,844
alternative views to the homepage,
new experimental presentations of our 

37
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:14,661
top content features like times wire.
We had one called times extra.

38
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,420
We have a social networking layer called
um,

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,170
called times people.

40
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,000
Um,
and these are things that we spent a lot

41
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:25,680
of time trying to make as intuitive and 
it's easy to use as possible.

42
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,540
Um,
and sometimes,

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,030
you know,
we,

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,310
we hit the mark and a lot of times 
people will ask us,

45
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,203
you know,
what does this thing do that you have 

46
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,910
here?
I have really no idea,

47
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:36,744
no understanding of it.
And it's just sort of blows us out of 

48
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:40,980
the water that you know,
that they can be.

49
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:42,480
So,
um,

50
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,713
you know,
what we've designed can be so as 

51
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:46,344
unintuitive as,
as the reader might be interpreting it 

52
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:53,190
as.
So that's always a,

53
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,743
that's,
that's I think one of the hardest and 

54
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:59,260
most and most illuminating parts of the 
job is really,

55
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,903
really constantly reminding yourself 
that what's obvious to you is not 

56
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:05,050
obvious to the users.

57
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,983
Well,
I'll tell you about a big project that 

58
00:03:11,331 --> 00:03:15,290
we finished up late last year for we,
we have a,

59
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,033
um,
a luxury magazine that comes into with 

60
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:21,950
the Sunday paper called t,
um,

61
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,580
and that covers,
um,

62
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,390
men's fashion,
women's fashion design,

63
00:03:29,391 --> 00:03:30,630
travel,
living that,

64
00:03:30,631 --> 00:03:32,360
that sort of stuff.
Really high end luxury.

65
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,810
And we had a site that we launched in 
2007,

66
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:39,710
I believe that,
um,

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,740
you know,
we felt pretty,

68
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,603
pretty good about it at the time,
but it quickly became apparent that it 

69
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:46,424
was,
it was too expensive to produce and 

70
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:50,270
wasn't really yielding the results that 
we were looking for.

71
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:55,271
So we worked most of last year,
2009 really overhauling that sites.

72
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,593
Um,
and moving it away from what had been a 

73
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:05,561
presentation that was really centered 
around what appeared in print to a brand

74
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:12,251
new kind of user experience that really 
emphasize what we saw,

75
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,460
how we saw users interacting with the 
content.

76
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,293
So instead of showing all the 
photography and the photo spreads and 

77
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:28,361
the feature stories as the sole main 
gateway to that site,

78
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,480
we've moved to a new kind of experience 
where the content is,

79
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,183
I'm a bit more atomized,
you can sort of access it from many 

80
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,643
different many different ways and we're 
really emphasizing the blog and have 

81
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,521
the,
uh,

82
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:47,840
the site as,
um,

83
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,260
the major access point because what we 
saw was that users responded best to our

84
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:55,034
blog even though it was not the major,
the main access point that they 

85
00:04:58,401 --> 00:05:02,630
responded to its timeliness and its,
and the brevity of the content.

86
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,813
Um,
and so we completely reoriented the 

87
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:06,440
sites around that.
And,

88
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,260
and that was something I really pushed 
for 'em hard in,

89
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:12,050
uh,
in late 2008,

90
00:05:12,051 --> 00:05:12,884
early 2009.
And we were able to launch it late last 

91
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,493
year.
