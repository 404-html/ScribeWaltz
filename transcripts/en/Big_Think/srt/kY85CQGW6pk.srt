1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,900
Yeah,
I do agree with that.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,340
Uh,
we'll leave.

3
00:00:09,341 --> 00:00:10,720
The government should be open.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,370
Uh,
I think the worst example was when the

5
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:17,960
vice president said he wasn't as good as
submit to the scrutiny of Congress when

6
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:22,610
they asked them for a documents.
And then outrageously he said that he

7
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:26,270
was not going to provide them cause he
wasn't a member of the executive branch.

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,910
And I sat the Ysl well,
what is he a farmer?

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,630
My point is that when it comes to
national security,

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,330
when it comes to just simple
information,

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,730
I'll give you an example.
Uh,

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,170
I got into a little trouble when I said
at one of the debates that,

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,680
uh,
on Ufos aliens,

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,470
I don't believe in him,
but one of the problems that have been

15
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:52,820
compounded about propagating this myth
that aliens exist in Roswell,

16
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:56,690
New Mexico was because the government
has not provided full disclosure of

17
00:00:56,691 --> 00:01:01,430
incidents that happened years ago about
possible landings in Roswell,

18
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:04,340
New Mexico.
And if they just released all the

19
00:01:04,341 --> 00:01:05,670
information,
uh,

20
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:06,920
they wouldn't have had this problem.

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,360
Yeah,
I do believe in general,

22
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,590
government is very secretive.
It's very bureaucratic in many cases.

23
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:15,980
It turns people off.
It's very impersonal.

24
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,100
And one of the,
one of the objectives I would have is to

25
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:22,940
make the government more,
more friendly to people,

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,200
more responsive to people.
I would do that by leading by example.

27
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,960
I would,
uh,

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,520
look at everything that needed to be
declassified,

29
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:33,980
national security,
a domestic,

30
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,650
and I would say this is the first step
we're going to do.

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,090
Uh,
secondly,

32
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,580
I would also say to the American people,
uh,

33
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,550
I'm going to give you access to your
president.

34
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,440
I think the president is assemble a of
American government and leadership.

35
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,920
What I would do is I'd submit to
unfettered town meetings with the

36
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:55,160
American people.
I'd have office hours where ordinary

37
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:59,180
people could come to see me as long as
it were five minutes and they didn't

38
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:00,050
carry a weapon.

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,660
Actually,
I've done that as governor.

40
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,220
I would,
uh,

41
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,050
make the White House more part of the
American family,

42
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:11,300
make it more accessible.
Uh,

43
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,150
obviously a president has to worry about
security,

44
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,430
but I would spend a night in people's
homes just trying to explain that

45
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,520
government can be on the side of the
American people.

46
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:26,360
One of our big problems has been that
the American people think that

47
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:28,280
government is simply,
is not on their side.

48
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,780
That government is there to block
progress at government is there to make

49
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:34,730
things more difficult,
more bureaucratic.

50
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,910
A lot of it is the tone of leadership
that a president would break.

51
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,040
Okay.
