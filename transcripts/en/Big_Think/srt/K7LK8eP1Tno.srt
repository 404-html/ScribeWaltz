1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,600
I've spent though asked a dozen years
thinking about,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,550
uh,
what I consider to be one of the

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,790
fundamental challenges of leadership in
that is the challenge to notice critical

4
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:15,981
information in your environment.
There are so many interesting stories of

5
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:20,880
the new millennium of situations where
there were people who behaved

6
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:25,881
inappropriately and they get an awful
lot of attention in the headlines from

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,370
madoff to jp Morgan's recent problems to
Enron and across the hundreds of

8
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:37,710
scandals,
there are often some bad people doing

9
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:41,610
some bad things.
My focus is not on those individuals,

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,740
but the fact that in each of those cases
there are so many other people who

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,710
should have noticed something was wrong
and they didn't.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,450
Um,
Warren Bennis,

13
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,620
the leadership scholar,
um,

14
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,260
talked about one of the characteristics
of an excellent leader as somebody who

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,290
is a first class no desser.
And my book on the power of noticing is

16
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:08,511
really an attempt to help MBA students,
executives to become firstclass noticers

17
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,310
so that they can be aware of problems,
challenges,

18
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:18,180
and opportunities that would allow them
to be more effective.

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,750
The truth is I don't consider myself to
be a particularly effective notice.

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,460
Sir.
I've been working on it a lot in the

21
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,210
last dozen years.
Um,

22
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,210
but I always took pride in my ability to
focus as opposed to my ability to

23
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:35,280
notice.
And some of us who focus very,

24
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:40,170
very effectively might want to think
about the question of whether they can

25
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:44,070
develop the skills of noticing to go
along with their skills of focusing.

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,350
A number of years ago,
um,

27
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,840
I had an opportunity to notice,
um,

28
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,740
and I failed to do so.
And it's been an obsession with me ever

29
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:55,170
since.
On march 10 2005,

30
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:59,400
I was hired by the u s department of
Justice and a landmark case that they

31
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,440
were fighting against the tobacco
industry.

32
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,830
I was hired as a remedy witness.
That is,

33
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:09,210
I was hired to provide recommendations
to the court about what the penalty

34
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:14,211
would be if in fact the department of
Justice succeeded in its trial against

35
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:15,630
the tobacco industry.

36
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,980
I'd spend a couple of hundred hours
working for the Department of Justice,

37
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,550
including submitting my written direct
testimony,

38
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,760
which had been submitted to the court.
I was scheduled to be understand on May

39
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,820
4th where um,
the tobacco industry attorneys would be

40
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:39,831
asking you a series of questions on
April 30th a number of days before my

41
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:45,030
May 4th testimony,
I was in Washington dc to be to meet

42
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:50,031
with Department of Justice attorneys to
prepare for my time on the stand when

43
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:54,210
the day started,
the Department of Justice Attorney that

44
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:57,870
I had been working with said to me,
Professor Bays Herman,

45
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,580
this occurred long after he had learned
to call me Max.

46
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,360
You said Professor Bays,
the Department of Justice requests that

47
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:08,890
you amend your testimony to note that
the testimony would not be relevant if

48
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,140
any of the following four conditions
existed.

49
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,980
He then read to me for legal conditions
that I didn't understand when he was

50
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:18,730
done talking.
I said to him,

51
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,790
why would you ask me to amend my
testimony when you know that I didn't

52
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,920
understand what you just said to me?

53
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,160
And his response was because if you
don't agree,

54
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,700
there's a significant chance that senior
leadership in the Department of Justice

55
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,910
will remove you from the case before you
are on the stand on May 4th to which I

56
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:41,170
said,
okay,

57
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:45,070
I don't agree to those changes,
and his response was,

58
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,890
good.
Let's continue with your preparation.

59
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,040
I was jarred by the fact that something
very strange had occurred,

60
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,200
but I was overwhelmed in life.
I was trying to help this case and I

61
00:03:56,201 --> 00:04:01,201
didn't quite know what had occurred,
but to this day I'm critical of the fact

62
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:07,021
that they took no action.
I did appear on trial on May 4th and the

63
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:13,201
trial ended in early June,
but on June 17th I woke up in a hotel

64
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:17,170
room in London.
I was working with another client at the

65
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:22,171
time and they woke up early at 5:00 AM
and I opened up the New York Times Web

66
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:29,680
web edition and I read a story about
Matt Myers,

67
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,630
the president of tobacco free kids who
had come forward to the media with

68
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:38,800
evidence about how Robert Mccallum,
the number two official in the

69
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,380
Department of Justice,
was involved in attempting to get him to

70
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,550
change his testimony.

71
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,410
And I then read basically the same
account that I had experienced back on

72
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:52,411
April 30th Matt Myers had the insight to
know that he should do something with

73
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:58,381
this information about what had occurred
in terms of the attempt to tamper with

74
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,260
his testimony.
And at that point it was straight

75
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:07,261
forward to come forward to the media to
speak to congressional representatives

76
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:12,100
about what happened.
And my own role received media attention

77
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:14,530
as well.
But to this day I'm still struck by the

78
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:19,531
fact that I didn't come forward on April
30th when in the back of my mind I knew

79
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:24,610
something had occurred.
The reason I tell you this story is

80
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:28,420
because I think a lot of our fail you
did notice happens when we're busy.

81
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,970
It happens when we don't know exactly
what's happened,

82
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:34,980
what's happening,
but I think it's our job as the

83
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:36,550
executives,
as leaders,

84
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,330
as professionals,
to act when we're pretty sure that

85
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:44,740
there's something wrong.
It's our job to notice and to not simply

86
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,980
be passive when we can't quite figure
out the evidence.

87
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:53,070
It's our job to to take steps to figure
out what's going on and to act on,

88
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,390
on critical information.

89
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:57,620
Yeah.
