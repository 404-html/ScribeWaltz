1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah.
Preparing for an earthquake is

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,180
multifaceted,
multi dimensional.

3
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,190
And the first thing really is being
aware.

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,200
Uh,
yes,

5
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:21,420
I've said that earthquakes and occur
anywhere,

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,730
but they're more likely some places than
others.

7
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:27,330
So you know,
basic awareness of where your house,

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,620
where you work,
uh,

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,810
where you are relative to the faults
that might cause an earthquake.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,870
That's a matter of public education.
Um,

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,470
but once you know what you're a risk
might be,

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,160
uh,
you have to bake some sort of personal

13
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:47,790
judgment or if you're a government,
some sort of social judgment about the

14
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:51,300
level of risk that you're willing to
accept it is going to be.

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,920
And if you're willing to accept or only
willing to accept a low level of risk,

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,930
then there are a number of things you
need to do.

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,400
You do to ensure that major
infrastructure is resilient,

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,560
that our water lines are power lines are
built in such a way so that they won't

19
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:11,010
break that bridges and highways one fall
down,

20
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:16,370
that fire stations will remain standing
so that the fire personnel can respond

21
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,660
and that hospitals remained standing,
um,

22
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,040
with respect to individuals in their
homes.

23
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,960
Uh,
if you're in an earthquake zone,

24
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,690
ensuring that your building is up to
code,

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,120
if a code exists,
um,

26
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,310
ensuring that you follow that code and
even little things like keeping the

27
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:37,200
knickknacks away from the edge of the
shelf,

28
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,930
keeping your dishes way back.
Those are the sorts of things that can

29
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:44,931
make the difference between sort of a Ho
hum boy was at an interesting event to

30
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:47,910
something that was a disaster.
Um,

31
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,250
and these were all written down.
You can go to the fema websites,

32
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:52,920
you sgs websites,
there were a whole list of these things.

33
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,080
The problem arises when first you don't
have building codes,

34
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,510
uh,
or those codes aren't enforced.

35
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:04,710
That was a situation Haiti,
where you don't have the national or

36
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:08,880
social wealth to actually consider this
something you can do.

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,970
I mean they're the,
I don't mean to bring up Haiti

38
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:14,580
constantly,
but the issue there was that there were

39
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:19,500
so many sort of day to day problems
facing a Haiti culture in Haiti

40
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:20,334
government.

41
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,810
That's something that might happen.
Uh,

42
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,730
really can't get on the radar screen.
And you could argue the right or wrong

43
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:29,640
to that,
but that basically is a situation and

44
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:31,740
sad to say that's tap us throughout the
world.

45
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,890
Um,
so you know,

46
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,820
the basic things really quite easy to do
if you've got the money to do them and

47
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:41,880
if you've got the public awareness to do
them and if you've got the political

48
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:44,490
will to do them.
If you're dealing with the Commons,

49
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:47,230
if you're dealing with infrastructure,
uh,

50
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,280
where you don't have the political will
or the wealth,

51
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,430
uh,
there are a number of things that the

52
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:56,910
community is trying to do.
There's a lot of concentration on

53
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:01,911
building small scale community awareness
so that the awareness of disaster,

54
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,930
the awareness of potential disaster I
should say,

55
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,180
uh,
occurs almost at the household level and

56
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,750
enabling people to make decisions but
also giving them sort of the simple

57
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:16,570
things that they,
that they could do on a day to day

58
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,404
basis.

59
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,130
Not just for earthquakes but for floods,
for landslides.

60
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,270
Uh,
and for that matter,

61
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:24,910
for longer term issues like sea level
rise and climate change.

62
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,710
Uh,
you know,

63
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:29,230
one of the,
one of the key things that we're doing

64
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,980
at our institute and elsewhere is trying
to,

65
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,050
to bring the knowledge we have about
earth processes.

66
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,330
You're said dynamic planet.
It's fun to look at.

67
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,180
We enjoy doing that,
but it affects people.

68
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,780
And one of the things we're trying to do
is to bring that knowledge,

69
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,830
not just throw it over the fence so that
policy makers can use it.

70
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,000
Because,
you know,

71
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:53,980
there's none of a feedback and that kind
of a system.

72
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,840
Uh,
we really,

73
00:03:55,841 --> 00:04:00,760
scientists need to understand social and
cultural constraints on using the

74
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:02,320
information.
And in fact,

75
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,630
even the utility of the information that
they provide.

76
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,830
And if I may say,
I think the social scientists and

77
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:13,210
governments and ngos need to know what
they don't know,

78
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,550
and that's a difficult task.
Uh,

79
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,590
but to be honest,
it's an interesting and important thing

80
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:22,060
to do and we're getting better at it.
