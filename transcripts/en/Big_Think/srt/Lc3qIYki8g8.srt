1
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,920
Well,
America is,

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,590
has a wonderfully rich artistic legacy.
Uh,

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,800
it's predominantly European,
uh,

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,990
even though it's unfashionable to say
that,

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,500
but it's a,
a mix of European cultures that doesn't

6
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:22,140
happen in Europe.
And then by the time they got to the

7
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:24,150
west coast,
they were suddenly being hit with,

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,150
with native American,
uh,

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,490
with Asian,
with Latin American and oceanic

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,630
traditions too.
And so the American arts are in a funny

11
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:35,100
way,
a meeting place,

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,230
uh,
of world culture onto which are the kind

13
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:43,470
of a European DNA.
Everything else has been grafted.

14
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:45,600
Perfect example of this is jazz,
you know,

15
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:48,920
which takes this s four square European,
uh,

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,520
kind of music and then begins to
syncopate it to African poly rhythms.

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,870
And you know,
this,

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,501
uh,
you know,

19
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:59,430
and if you look at the way that the AF,
the African arts largely as they came

20
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:01,710
through the Caribbean and through
American slave culture,

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,160
completely transformed with the American
European arts are,

22
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,990
you know,
I think that what we are here as a

23
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:08,770
meeting place,
a kind of laboratory of,

24
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:10,500
of,
of human existence.

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,270
I mean,
there's a really interesting thing,

26
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,100
and I've really never heard anybody say
this.

27
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,510
If you look at the last hundred years of
the arts,

28
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,750
there has never been a place it,
all of human history that has had as

29
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:27,810
much happen as the United States has
during the last hundred years.

30
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,740
And it's ranged from classical music to
jazz,

31
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:36,690
to rock and roll to hip hop,
from abstract expressionist painting to

32
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:38,640
film,
to comic books.

33
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,571
Um,
you know,

34
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:41,120
to a newspaper,
uh,

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,270
you know,
cartooning,

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,710
uh,
novels,

37
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:45,060
poetry,
drama,

38
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,220
TV,
et Cetera,

39
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,060
et cetera.
I haven't even begun to exhaust the

40
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:48,501
arts.
I mean,

41
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:53,501
just in music loud.
And I do believe that in some funny way,

42
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,040
this unbelievable diversity of
expression has come out of the fact that

43
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,900
we were the first big society in
history,

44
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,250
uh,
which let the individual be free to

45
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:12,600
pursue with the individual wanted.
And that's why it's good not to have a

46
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:16,020
cultural policy.
The people should create their own art

47
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,110
in that ways that they want to do it.
And so,

48
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,070
uh,
I'm a huge fan of American art,

49
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:25,830
even though I have often criticize
aspects of American culture.

50
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,430
There's something happening in American
culture.

51
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,980
It's never happened before in all of
human history,

52
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,300
and it's exciting.
