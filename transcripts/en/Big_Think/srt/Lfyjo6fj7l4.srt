1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,513
Mm,

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,710
at a 100 mile run in San Diego and I was
running,

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,450
I was running this race as part of a six
person relay team with friends and he

4
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:18,740
was running the entire race by himself
and the run was unsupported so you have

5
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:21,530
to bring your own supplies.
So we had,

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,150
you know,
we overdid it a little bit.

7
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:25,790
We had a tent and we had misuses and
food.

8
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:29,240
I mean we were ready for like in case we
had to stay there a week and he had a

9
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:32,690
folding chair,
a bottle of water and a bag of crackers.

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,040
And I just thought to myself like,
who is this guy?

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,410
Never seen anything like it.
And during the race I kept an eye on

12
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:43,730
them and around mile 70 he weighed
probably 260 pounds,

13
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:45,770
which is quite large for an ultra
runner.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,510
He had broken all the small bones in
both of his feet and a kidney damage.

15
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,360
And he finished the race.
So when it was done,

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,420
I googled them to fascinating life story
and I decided literally to cold call

17
00:00:58,421 --> 00:01:02,150
them and I flew out and met with them.
And after sitting with him for a couple

18
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:05,510
of minutes,
I realized that I could learn so much

19
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,770
from a guy like this and what makes them
tick and various buckets in my life

20
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:13,550
would be so much better if a little bit
of what he had rubbed off on me.

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,070
I asked him to come live with my family
and I for a month.

22
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,520
So at the time that I invited seal to
come live with us,

23
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,340
I had an 18 month old son.
I was married,

24
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,320
still am two more kids since.
And I had sold a couple of businesses.

25
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:30,290
I was in a great place professionally in
my life,

26
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,060
but I was also in a routine and routines
are great but they can also be a Rut.

27
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,280
And I found that I just wasn't getting
better.

28
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,300
I was doing the same thing every day.
Like so many of us wake up,

29
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,370
go to work,
come home,

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,810
have dinner,
repeat.

31
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,310
And I just wanted to get off autopilot
and I thought that he would be a great

32
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:54,290
way to get in good shape,
but also to just mix up my routine and,

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,470
and get better.
The first day that seal came to live

34
00:01:57,471 --> 00:01:59,420
with me,
he asked me to do.

35
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,980
He said,
how many pull ups can you do?

36
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,540
And I'm not great at pull ups.
I did about eight just getting over the

37
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,750
bar eight and then started to take 30
seconds and do it again.

38
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,050
So 30 seconds later I got up on the bar
and I did six struggling and instead.

39
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:14,990
All right,
one more time.

40
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:18,920
We waited 30 seconds and I barely got
three or four and I was done.

41
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,730
I couldn't move my arms done.
And he said,

42
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:24,500
all right,
we're not leaving here until you do 100

43
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:26,840
more.
And I thought there's no what we're

44
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:29,450
going to be here for quite a long time
because there's no way that I could do

45
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:33,260
100.
But I ended up doing it one at a time

46
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,350
and he showed me,
proved me right there that,

47
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:37,550
you know,
there was so much more.

48
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:39,920
We're all capable of so much more than
we think we are.

49
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,630
And it was just a great lesson.
Was actually the first thing that we did

50
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,300
a.
It was just a great lesson and we had so

51
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,370
much more than our reserve tank than we
think we do.

52
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,990
One of the things that seal said to me,
and it's in the book and one thing that

53
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:55,970
people have said that really resonated
with them,

54
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,230
he would say that when your,
when your mind is telling you you're

55
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:02,740
done,
you're really only 40 percent done.

56
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,590
And he had a motto,
if it doesn't suck,

57
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:09,010
we don't do it.
And that was his way of every day

58
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,300
forcing us to get uncomfortable to
figure out what our baseline was and,

59
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,650
and what are,
you know,

60
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,910
what our comfort level was and just,
you know,

61
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,160
turning it upside down.
The 40 percent rule,

62
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,530
maybe it's give or take a look at a
marathon.

63
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,800
Most people hit the wall at a marathon
at mile,

64
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,640
anywhere from 16 to 20.
And you know,

65
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,910
99 percent of the people in this country
that run marathons finish and they all,

66
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,720
predominantly all of them go through
this,

67
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,410
hit the wall.
So where does that extra 50 or 60

68
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:43,240
percent or whatever the number is come
from.

69
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:44,860
I mean,
it's their brain saying,

70
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:46,450
I'm done,
I don't want to continue,

71
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,370
but there will saying,
you know what,

72
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:51,070
let me get to the finish line.
So we all have that will.

73
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,920
It's just a matter of how do we apply it
to not just the once a year marathon,

74
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:02,130
but through our daily lives and make it
apply to a variety of things.
