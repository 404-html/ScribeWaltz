1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,131
Yeah,
I mean,

2
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:08,000
I think,
you know,

3
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:13,001
Kubler Ross did a,
an enormous service to medicine and to,

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,990
you know,
to the world at large by drawing

5
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:19,010
attention to the importance of,
of basically,

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,660
um,
reactions to dying and then to death

7
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:25,520
itself.
However,

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,570
her insights or whatever her,
her ideas,

9
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:34,571
I think about what exactly happens,
have not turned out to be very helpful

10
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:37,250
because they don't turn out to be very
accurate.

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,950
Um,
and so what,

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,550
what I think about,
um,

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,340
the trajectory of grief really is
informed very much so by many colleagues

14
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:54,050
who have now done work looking closely
at that,

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,780
um,
process in different kinds of

16
00:00:56,781 --> 00:01:00,830
situations.
And I think that I put it together in a

17
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:03,650
slightly different way than,
than maybe some other people do.

18
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:05,570
But,
but I think that,

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,030
um,
what actually happens when someone dies

20
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,261
that you're,
again,

21
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:13,190
that you're very close to.

22
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,750
That's what really what we're talking
about here.

23
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:15,860
Because,
um,

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,980
you don't go through such a dramatic
process when it's someone that,

25
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,450
you know,
but so this is someone very,

26
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:25,310
very close.
So what happens,

27
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,750
um,
how I understand what happens is that we

28
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:34,910
have to start with what is that love
relationship to start with.

29
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,420
And the,
you know,

30
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,250
love is something that we all feel and
that we're,

31
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,720
we're biologically probably programmed
to feel.

32
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:47,150
And in,
in psychology or psychiatry,

33
00:01:47,151 --> 00:01:50,780
we talk about a love relationship as an
attachment relationship.

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,200
And so the attachment system is a
biological system that actually curves

35
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,670
and other animals,
not only in humans and it,

36
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,850
it begins even before we're born.
So baby can recognize its mother on the

37
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:06,170
very first day of its life.
And then of course,

38
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,930
you know,
you get that very strong attachment

39
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:11,750
relationship between an infant and it's
caregiver.

40
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,810
Usually it's mother and other people in
it's environment.

41
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:17,150
And then as the child grows,
grows older,

42
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:18,950
there may be a couple of other people
too,

43
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:21,500
which it's very,
very attached.

44
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:24,530
And,
and actually what starts to happen also

45
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,420
as a child gets older is that the child
starts to learn how to be a caregiver

46
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:34,730
because of course the mother is the
caregiver early on.

47
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:37,400
So,
so as we get older,

48
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:42,350
and by the time we're adults,
we are caregivers for the people that we

49
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,240
take care of us.
So what happens when someone dies is

50
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:50,360
that we lose not only the person who's
taking care of us,

51
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,630
but also the person who,
a person who we put a lot of energy and

52
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,840
a lot of ourselves into taking care of.
And actually it turns out that for

53
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:05,110
adults,
if you make them decide,

54
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:06,430
is it more important,
you know,

55
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:08,800
if you make them choose,
is it more important to take care of

56
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:11,170
someone else or to be taking care of
yourself?

57
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,180
Do you have any idea what they'd say?

58
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,250
So basically they,
they will always say,

59
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:23,580
most of the time say that it's much more
important to feel good about taking care

60
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:25,530
of someone else.
So now,

61
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,080
you know,
now let's go back to the bereavement

62
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:33,081
situation because what's happened is
someone has died who's very important to

63
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:36,510
you to being a sort of,
it's the person who,

64
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,300
um,
you turn to when you're under stress or

65
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:43,680
the person who's kind of behind you,
cheering for you when you're,

66
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,430
when you're trying something new or
having confidence in you when you're

67
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:50,190
doing something.
And that's very important,

68
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,010
but you're,
but this is also the person that you do

69
00:03:53,011 --> 00:03:57,480
those things for and that you try to
protect and help in their life.

70
00:03:57,481 --> 00:03:59,490
So when they die,
by definition,

71
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,210
you failed as a caregiver.
So one of the things,

72
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:07,590
so basically the two things that happen
when someone dies is that attachment

73
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:09,390
system gets very activated.

74
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,860
And so does the caregiver system.
And what does that mean in everyday

75
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:16,410
life?
Would that means that you start to

76
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:18,150
think,
how am I going to manage without this

77
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:20,670
person?
And then you also think,

78
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,260
why didn't I prevent this death?
I could have done,

79
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,640
you know,
I should have done something to make it

80
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,474
better.
I should have,

81
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,370
you know,
take the World Trade Center.

82
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,180
A lot of people had the thought,
why didn't I stop this person from going

83
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:34,680
to work that day?
You know,

84
00:04:34,681 --> 00:04:38,850
even though it was not rational thought,
these are not rational thoughts.

85
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:40,800
Of course you're going to manage without
this person.

86
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:42,150
Of course you didn't,
you know,

87
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:45,210
do something to lead to this person's
death.

88
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:47,280
But they're automatic instinctive
thoughts.

89
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,330
So that's the first thing that happens.
And so you start to have these different

90
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:54,690
kinds of problems to solve and that's
really acute grief.

91
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,510
That's what you start to think about.
And you start to think a lot about,

92
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,030
you know,
you try to find the person for both

93
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,660
reasons in your mind because we have,
um,

94
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,750
we have,
we think a very special place in our

95
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:10,050
minds for the person who we're so
attached to.

96
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,710
And so what we have to do is we have to
gradually come to terms with the fact

97
00:05:16,561 --> 00:05:21,561
that that person is gone forever and
that information is very difficult.

98
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,213
Okay?

99
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,510
Very difficult to accept.
And so we don't accept it right away.

100
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
In the beginning,
we,

101
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:36,340
we feel a sense of disbelief.
And we also,

102
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,750
um,
have that,

103
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,830
you know,
people will,

104
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,580
will feel like they're going to see the
person walking into the room that

105
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:47,350
somehow they have that feeling.
And so they are slate between facing it

106
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,680
and then setting it aside.
And you get this kind of oscillation

107
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:54,160
during acute grief and gradually,
um,

108
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,360
the,
the,

109
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,140
the,
you find some way,

110
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,700
and people do this differently to but to
think about the fact,

111
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:04,340
okay,
they're gone and that it's natural for

112
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,450
people to die.
And you know,

113
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:10,451
you come to terms with that emotionally
as well as kind of cognitively or in

114
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:15,800
your thoughts.
So you have two basic forms of grief and

115
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:20,801
you have this oscillating trajectory
that eventually leads to a place where,

116
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,210
where it's in the background and where
you just kind of revisit it from time to

117
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:29,370
time in your life.
Huh?
