1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:09,150
The ceiling of it emotion is a process
that is distinct from having the emotion

2
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:13,530
in the first place.
So in order to understand what is an

3
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:15,510
emotion,
what is it feeling,

4
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:19,650
we need to understand what is an emotion
and an emotion is the execution of a

5
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:24,390
very complex program of actions,
some actions that are actually movements

6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,420
like movement that you can do,
change your face,

7
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:28,360
for example,
in,

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,590
in fear a or movements that are internal
that happened in your heart or in your

9
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:38,760
gut and movements that are actually not
muscular movements,

10
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:43,380
but rather releases of molecules,
say for example,

11
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:46,140
in the endocrine system into the
bloodstream,

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,160
but it's movement and action in the
broad sense of the term.

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,450
And uh,
an emotional consists of a very well

14
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:59,451
orchestrated set of alterations in the
body that has as a general purpose,

15
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:06,290
uh,
making life more survivable by taking

16
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:10,920
care of a danger or taking care of an
opportunity either or,

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,720
or something in between.

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,200
And it's something that is set in our
genome and that we all have with a

19
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:23,631
certain program nature that is modified
by our experience.

20
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:28,890
So individually we have variations on
the bathroom,

21
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,340
but in essence your emotion of joy and
mine are going to be extremely similar.

22
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,000
We may express them physically,
slightly differently and it's of course

23
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:45,480
graded depending on the circumstance,
but the the,

24
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,720
the essence of the process is going to
be the same unless one of us is not

25
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,210
quite well put together and is missing
something.

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,230
Otherwise it's going to be the same.
It's going to be the same across even

27
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:02,910
other species.
You know there's a way that we may smile

28
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:07,911
and the dog may wag the tail,
but in essence we have a set program and

29
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:13,410
those programs are similar across
individuals into species.

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Then the feeling is actually a portrayal
of what is going on in the Oregon is

31
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:27,270
when you're having an emotion,
so it's really the next thing that

32
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,314
happens.

33
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,950
If you have adjusted emotion,
you would not necessarily feel it.

34
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,460
To feel an emotion.
You need to represent in the brain in

35
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,760
structures that are actually different
from the structures which lead to the

36
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,850
emotion.
What is going on in the organism when

37
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:49,851
you're having the emotion so you can
define it very simply as the process of

38
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,760
perceiving what is going on in the
organism,

39
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:58,761
when you are in the throes of an emotion
and that is achieved by a of structures.

40
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,210
Some move the chair in the brainstem and
some of which are in the cerebral

41
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:06,460
cortex,
namely the insular Cortex,

42
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,600
which I like to mention,
not because I think it's the most

43
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:12,090
important.
It's not.

44
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,030
I actually don't think it's the number
one structure,

45
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,630
a controlling our feelings,
but I like to mention it because it's

46
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:24,490
something that people didn't really know
about and many years ago,

47
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:28,150
which probably now are going close to 20
years ago.

48
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,830
I thought that the incident would be an
important platform for feelings.

49
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,270
That's where I started and there was a
hypothesis and turns out that the

50
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:41,740
hypothesis is perfectly correct and 10
years ago we had the first experiments

51
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:46,741
that showed that it was indeed so.
And since then a countless.

52
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:51,751
Studies have shown that when you are
having feelings of emotion or feelings

53
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:56,050
of variety of other things,
the insula is active.

54
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,370
But it doesn't mean that it's the only
thing that is active and there are other

55
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:02,290
structures that are very important as
well.

56
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,540
Well,
is he emotion opera?

57
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,980
Very often when you think about how you
react to the world,

58
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:15,940
uh,
you know,

59
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,940
something is happening to you there.
You're simply going along and your being

60
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:25,890
confronted by different things,
not necessarily very important or

61
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,900
significance for your ultimate life,
but you are constantly reacting to the

62
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:34,510
world.
You're thinking about the world in your

63
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,540
acting on the world.
And emotions are engaged when the stakes

64
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:47,790
outside of your organism are fairly high
in positive or negative directions.

65
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,620
And this of course comes from ancient
times in biology when you were

66
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,860
constantly being subject to potential
threats and to potential opportunities.

67
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,120
The threats were obvious,
for example,

68
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,950
predation,
uh,

69
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,260
or inclement weather or,
um,

70
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:14,670
physical environments where you would be
like having a precipice,

71
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,030
a or a hole on the ground.
Uh,

72
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:21,400
the opportunities are also very easy to
see.

73
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:25,780
They have fundamentally to do with food
and with sex.

74
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,890
And so the motions were placed there in
evolution is incredibly smart devices

75
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,620
that rather than having you think
through the problem,

76
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,280
would deliver a solution and make sure
that you would act right.

77
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,760
It's in a way a contribution to a sort
of on auto pilot that we've inherited

78
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,370
through all these millions of years of
evolution.

79
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,610
So if there is an opportunity,
emotion is going to make sure that you

80
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,890
at some level know that it's there and
that you're going to have the tendency

81
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:09,320
to act on it.
And if there is a threat,

82
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:14,321
you're going to be alerted to it.
And even before you're alerted to the

83
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:16,160
threat,
as such,

84
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,900
you're going to be placed in
circumstances that are likely to make

85
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:23,840
you either freeze or run away from the
danger.

86
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,190
Okay?
So this is a level of response to the

87
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:32,840
world that is automated.
It's largely nonconscious.

88
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,160
I mean,
it happens,

89
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,530
nonconscious.
Then you'd take consciousness of it

90
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,030
because once it's happening,
once you start feeling what is happening

91
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,940
and connecting the feeling to what
you're perceiving,

92
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:47,010
then you realize how hard there's the
danger or ha,

93
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,460
here's the next lunch.
Um,

94
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,720
and so there is a level in which you
will have a way in which the entire

95
00:06:56,211 --> 00:07:01,190
process then is made conscious and
enters your mind flow.

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,680
Uh,
and uh,

97
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,940
even at this level,
you can see that the influence on one's

98
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:12,370
behavior is astounding and it's by and
large,

99
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,560
extremely useful.
It has of course its downsides because

100
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:20,270
you may be responding to things that are
better not respond to either on the

101
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:23,780
negative and positive side,
and that you should not take the bait.

102
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,340
You should not,
for example,

103
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:29,690
fall for every opportunity and you
should not allow yourself to be made

104
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:30,680
angry,
angry,

105
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:33,650
for example,
or fearful when there is no cause for

106
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:33,980
it.

107
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,590
Um,
but there is a,

108
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,520
a way in which by and large,
the influences very positive,

109
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,640
uh,
and then it,

110
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,830
it,
the,

111
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,860
the experiences of emotion also have a
way of modeling what your going to do

112
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:53,330
next.
Because unlike say,

113
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:57,320
a squirrel,
a who is not going to think much about

114
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,730
his or her experiences of emotion.
We do,

115
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,450
and we have,
because we have feelings because those

116
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:10,451
feelings can actually stay in memory in
terms of the elaborations that we make

117
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,610
about the feelings,
for example,

118
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:17,090
using language.
Then we have a possibility of using

119
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,280
feelings of certain emotions for future
planning and that makes a huge

120
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:23,630
difference.
So,

121
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,440
uh,
for a little animal that doesn't have

122
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:28,980
much mind,
uh,

123
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:34,310
and no advanced planning,
it's a way of keeping alive for animals

124
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,810
like us.
It's a way of keeping alive sometimes,

125
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:43,811
but an even better way of constructing a
view of the world and making sure that

126
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:47,440
that view is taken into consider

127
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,900
when we plan future events.
