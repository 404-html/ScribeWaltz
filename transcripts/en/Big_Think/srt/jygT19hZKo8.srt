1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,480
Um,
we hired somebody to help us with the

2
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:18,820
business that was just,
I should have,

3
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:20,510
you know,
when you say you should listen to your

4
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:24,350
instincts.
And we were feeling like we were,

5
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,680
I don't want to say overwhelmed,
but we know we needed a consultant for

6
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:31,010
something and we knew we needed a
consultant but weren't really sure how

7
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:33,560
to address it.
And somebody had recommended somebody

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,020
and we both felt,
you know,

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,740
there was something off.
And then it turned out to be very,

10
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:43,080
very off.
And I'll,

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,490
I'll look at it that it was a learning
experience and it could have been a lot

12
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:48,050
worse.
And you know,

13
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:51,740
we caught it at the beginning and now
it's almost done.

14
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:54,320
But it's the newest mistake.
I don't,

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,930
and I think he might not hear it is the
worst mistake.

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,790
I guess.
Maybe because he was toxic.

17
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,750
I mean,
that was the worst.

18
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:03,290
It was just someone who lied and cheated
and you know,

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,400
and it happens.
I mean,

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,273
it's human nature.

21
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,570
Sure.
A lot of mistakes,

22
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:09,090
but nothing like big or bad.

23
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,921
Yeah.
I mean we,

24
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:14,921
we usually catch them at a certain,
I mean the good news is when you're

25
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:17,110
relatively small or yours,
make mistakes,

26
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:21,900
so relatively small as well.
And when you're big it can be colossal.

27
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,020
And so as a young,
very supple company we can recover from,

28
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,180
but everyone makes mistakes.
I think the real question is do you make

29
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:35,181
the same mistake twice?
I think it's is important.

30
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:38,460
I think,
um,

31
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,770
probably should have done,
do more due diligence.

32
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,210
I think it was just,
we were,

33
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,900
the business was moving very,
very fast and frantically,

34
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:48,970
we know we needed somebody and we were
like,

35
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,870
alright,
let's just do it.

36
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,361
Well,
we've,

37
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,100
we've made,
we've made higher.

38
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:56,360
We've had hires that have been sort of
got responses which have been great and

39
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,650
others that have not.
And we've had other hires that weren't

40
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:04,140
necessarily a gut response,
but they were hired nonetheless and

41
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,640
again,
terrific ones where we weren't

42
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:08,380
necessarily,

43
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,200
you know,
the lesson after two,

44
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:12,550
three weeks,
what you have.

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,770
And we probably should've reacted,
uh,

46
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,820
more quickly than we actually did

47
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,200
for a company of our size.
The thing that I think is most crucial

48
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,730
in terms of what we do is hurting
somebody that culturally is a good fit.

49
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,450
And if they're smart and they fill the
position in a,

50
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,960
in a manner for which they have
experience or we feel is appropriate,

51
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:35,794
et Cetera,
et cetera.

52
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:41,100
Having the cultural fit and the passion
for the business is probably the biggest

53
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:43,830
hurdle because we're only 20 people of
which,

54
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,150
you know,
10 of those are working sort of right

55
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:51,151
out of our office in New York City.
And I think that's the most crucial

56
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:54,130
aspect of,
of where we are for this size today.
