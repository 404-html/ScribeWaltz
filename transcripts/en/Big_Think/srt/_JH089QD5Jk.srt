1
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,520
I'm just curious,
what would life look like if it had

2
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:14,360
evolved from viruses instead of
bacteria?

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,510
Maybe life did evolve from viruses and
we just don't know it.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,411
Doo,
Doo,

5
00:00:18,411 --> 00:00:19,190
Doo Doo,
Doo,

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,023
Doo,
Doo Doo.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,990
However,
it sure looks like a bacteria went off

8
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,250
on their own.
And you know,

9
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:30,251
when I talking some more about me in my
book undeniable,

10
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:34,400
which I like to think of as a primmer,
a primer on evolution,

11
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:39,170
I speculated that viruses should have
their own domain of life.

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,190
The VIRA,
which in Latin would be second

13
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:46,440
declension now and uh,
in Latin,

14
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,190
apparently they did not have a plural of
virus.

15
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:53,270
They never needed one.
They never used it in the way we use it

16
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:55,190
today.
So I,

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,920
I don't know if life evolved from
viruses,

18
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,820
but in my own experience,
I am thoroughly charmed by the science

19
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:06,821
fiction story and drama to strain where
the compartmentalization of the chem

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,040
chemicals needed for life was done with
crystals rather than with membranes.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,450
And it's science fiction,
everybody,

22
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,050
but bacteria are different from viruses
in that bacteria have these separate

23
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,400
structures,
whereas viruses seem to be a single

24
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:30,590
molecule.
What'd you might think of as a single

25
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:35,210
molecule.
And so viruses are more akin to proteins

26
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,700
then they are at a bacteria,
but proteins are created by bacteria.

27
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:45,701
So it is very reasonable that there was
some ancestor to viruses and bacteria so

28
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:52,121
that they have in common a common
chemical ancestor proving that seems to

29
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:54,950
me it should,
it should be possible.

30
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,260
When I was growing up,
people celebrated and questioned and

31
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:05,261
thought hard about the Miller array
experiment or Array Miller experiment

32
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,500
done by these two scientists who tried
to create the conditions of the

33
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:16,931
primordial earth in a big glass flask.
And uh,

34
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:22,310
apparently the one thing they didn't all
the way figured out was sulfur,

35
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,870
which now people generally believe would
have come into the earth's atmosphere

36
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:27,980
from volcanoes.

37
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,760
When I was in school at Cornell
University,

38
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:36,761
I walked into the space sciences
building when Carl Sagan was very active

39
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:41,420
and uh,
teaching classes and stuff and they had

40
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:46,250
the early Miller experiment running.
It was the big glass flask with these

41
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:51,251
electrodes sparking because it was
presumed or it is presumed that in the

42
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:57,020
ancient atmosphere there was lightening
and this electricity could cause

43
00:02:57,021 --> 00:02:58,940
chemical changes that would happen very,
very.

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,440
And so the idea is that you would look
for or try to create molecules

45
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,450
that through their natural existence
created copies of themselves.

46
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,830
And so that was the goal.
It turns out that creating amino acids,

47
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,670
these are biological molecules that have
a carbon with a double bond and an

48
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:29,530
oxygen on the side that turns out amino
acids aren't apparently that hard to

49
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:34,030
create.
And we find them in asteroids and we

50
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:39,031
find them all over the earth and
scientists or chemists have been able to

51
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:44,161
create amino acids that have the same
pattern but don't exist in nature or we

52
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:45,064
haven't found them.

53
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,490
And living systems instead,
they're very similar,

54
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:50,980
but they're not that.
We don't find them in nature.

55
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,670
So all this makes me think that it is
reasonable that someone could create

56
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:01,600
something akin to these primordial
atmosphere,

57
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:06,070
primordial condition.
It's on earth experiments that would

58
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,410
make molecules that replicated
themselves.

59
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,330
And we would find that the,
maybe there is a common ancestor to both

60
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:16,150
viruses and bacteria.
Whoa.

61
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,690
Would that molecule be dangerous?
Would it be like a super virus or the

62
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:23,820
super bacteria?
Uh,

63
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,710
intuitively I don't think so cause we're
all here.

64
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:27,970
Uh,
we all,

65
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,650
whatever happened,
happened and we,

66
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:31,780
it didn't kill us.
So,

67
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:34,720
uh,
maybe you'll be the guy that figures out

68
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,940
the early,
early Miller and the next step,

69
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,110
the next step of early Miller,
the next step of self replicating

70
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:46,111
molecules with primordial components.
It is a very compelling idea.

71
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,770
Keep us posted.
