00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,240
Arianna,
I wanted to open up by talking a little

2
00:00:10,241 --> 00:00:14,680
bit about the introduction to your book,
so you write about this collapse that

3
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:18,280
you suffered,
that really made you reevaluate your

4
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:19,690
life,
your priorities,

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:25,170
and I'm curious how mindfulness came out
of that because you write a lot about

6
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:26,680
health,
sleep,

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,050
exercise,
and you could have very well,

8
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:30,400
you know,
taken a vacation,

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,560
gotten some sleep,
and then moved on.

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,790
Why did you decide to stop and focus on
mindfulness as well?

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,140
For me,
this collapse eight years ago when I

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,020
collapsed,
literally from burnout,

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,730
sleep deprivation,
exhaustion,

14
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:50,260
hit my head on my desk,
broke my cheekbone and find myself

15
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:54,750
coming to in a pool of blood of my own.
I that,

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,710
that moment really made me reevaluate a
lot of my life.

17
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:00,790
And,
uh,

18
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,580
in the course of my life,
I had always been interested in

19
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:05,410
mindfulness,
in meditation.

20
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,870
My mother taught me to meditate when I
was 13,

21
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,730
living in Athens,
Greece.

22
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:13,170
That was quite exceptional at the time.
Um,

23
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,200
I went to India and comparative religion
before I went to college.

24
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,590
I've meditated on and off all my life,
so I've always been drawn to that aspect

25
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:28,501
of life who had changed eight years ago
is that I realized that I didn't want

26
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:33,790
this to be sort of episodic
journeys,

27
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,050
but to integrate them into my life on a
daily basis.

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,770
And um,
I started the science which is pretty

29
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:44,210
incontrovertible.
And,

30
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,310
and then I became fascinated with how
despite all that we know scientifically,

31
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:55,510
behaviorally how hard it is for us to
still change,

32
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,760
right?
And the,

33
00:01:56,761 --> 00:02:01,761
and that's really a big part of thrives.
That how can we move from knowing what

34
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:06,991
is best for us to actually doing what is
best for us and to realize there are no

35
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:12,181
trade offs between leading and effective
live with what you produce,

36
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:15,580
results and,
and get stuff done.

37
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,640
And also being mindful and,
and taking care of that deeper dimension

38
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,910
of ourselves.
So when we talk about mindfulness today,

39
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,890
um,
how would you describe its main tenant?

40
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,940
So what do we mean when we say we need
our lives to be more mind?

41
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:36,010
I love actually what I'm John Kevin has
said about mindfulness,

42
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,740
which is that it's really heartfulness
as well as mindfulness.

43
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:45,820
It's really being fully present each
moment of our lives,

44
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,290
a mind and heart and body of cars.
And then what follows is that

45
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:56,680
recommendation that thoughts are going
to come,

46
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,080
you know,
we're not going to do star Bar,

47
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,840
but we don't really have to follow them
wherever they go.

48
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,260
And that's where for me,
breathing and consciously inhaling and

49
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,220
exhaling,
um,

50
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,280
is such an essential part of mindfulness
because I use my breath to return to

51
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:23,410
that centered place in us and let the
thoughts come and go instead of

52
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,250
following every thought,
sort of slavish Lee,

53
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,090
wherever it wants to go.

54
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,850
The other thing is that there has been,
as you know,

55
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:35,851
this avalanche of new scientific
discoveries that have validated ancient

56
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,730
wisdom.
So she lost her purse and spiritual

57
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:44,731
teachers have always known this things,
but now we have modern science

58
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,020
validating them.
For me,

59
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:48,960
some of the most important work is very
true.

60
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,970
Davidson at the University of Wisconsin
who is actually used modern methods like

61
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,460
Mris and lasers on,
uh,

62
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:01,810
on,
on the brains of Buddhist monks who've

63
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:06,811
meditated for years to see some
incredible results on the brain itself,

64
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,730
you know,
on gamma waves that show how that,

65
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:17,731
the plasticity of the brain is
extraordinary and we can actually affect

66
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,600
how our brain functions.
Um,

67
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,350
my being more mindful and taking time to
meditate and doing all these things.

68
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,560
In your book,
you refer a lot to steve jobs.

69
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,410
That's kind of someone who really took
this to heart,

70
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,350
um,
and managed to,

71
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,880
you know,
put,

72
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,150
put things like mindfulness ahead of
other things that people normally linked

73
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:46,000
to success and ended up succeeding more
so than almost anyone else.

74
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,600
In your mind,
is it possible to achieve that kind of

75
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:52,510
success?
We can call jobs a genius if you want.

76
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,610
Um,
without mindfulness,

77
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,170
is it actually an essential component or
is it something that you can take or

78
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:00,004
leave?

79
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,220
I think geniuses are so rare that I'm
sure there are many ways to be a genius

80
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,730
know by definition.
It does not conform to a standard

81
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:15,550
deviation.
So I'm talking about

82
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,160
all of us,
you know,

83
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:23,161
the rest of us who are not certified
junior says what makes for a life that

84
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:28,600
is both more meaningful,
um,

85
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,980
and uh,
and more effective.

86
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:36,670
I like to use that word because we all
want to be effective at whatever we are

87
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:41,671
doing for the vast majority of people we
know for certain,

88
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,140
um,
that mindfulness and Hans has everything

89
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,800
they enhanced performance.
Uh,

90
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,770
there is no trade off between being
mindful and being effective.

91
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,310
It also enhances our own experience of
life because if we just define live

92
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:06,410
purely in terms of success,
reduced to these two metrics of money

93
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:10,790
and power,
we're missing out on what for me is the

94
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,700
essence of life,
which you cannot really experience

95
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:17,120
without the third metric,
which is like the third leg of the store

96
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,440
in thrive.

97
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,040
I define it as consisting of these four
pillars,

98
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,740
well being,
wisdom,

99
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,330
wonder,
and giving.

100
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,060
And that's really what a complete life
is.

101
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:34,061
And very often we've seen people who
reach a level of success and then begin

102
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:39,761
to integrate a giving.
Our wonder by there it maybe too late to

103
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:45,281
integrate wellbeing because we now know
that tall that are around health and

104
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:52,301
immune system take if we live in in ways
that are consistently stressful and

105
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:56,270
wisdom,
which has to do with decision making.

106
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,610
Again,
I've caught a lot of people in the book

107
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:02,930
acknowledging like Bill Clinton,
who said that the most important

108
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:07,700
mistakes I made I made when I was tired.
So the connection between exhaustion,

109
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,240
sleep deprivation,
etc. And bad decisions is huge.
