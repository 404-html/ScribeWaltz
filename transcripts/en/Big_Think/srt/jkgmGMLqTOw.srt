1
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,030
They want you to buy in her life.
My favorite example of this ridiculous,

2
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,960
which is Nascar.

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,440
Here's this,
you know,

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,380
it's,
it's somewhat legitimate because here's

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,530
actual,
an actual sport behind this brand.

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,420
There's actually a product that people
can get.

7
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:33,080
It's new.
It's,

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,570
it's,
it's got a lot of different angles to

9
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:38,880
it,
but NASCAR sales romance novels and ask

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,760
ourselves packaged meats.
Nascar is this massive lifestyle brand

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,440
that wants to find all kinds of touch
points to draw you further into the

12
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:50,360
NASCAR lifestyle.
Um,

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,410
so from a consumer perspective,
uh,

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,140
you know,
what brands do you like?

15
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:57,860
How are they drawing you in so that you
spend more of your money with them?

16
00:00:57,861 --> 00:00:58,750
Is it apple,
you know,

17
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:00,770
would you,
would you buy an apple product even if

18
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:05,150
it wasn't as good as something else?
Is it a certain brand of clothing?

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,240
I'm Thomas Pink makes,
makes great shirts,

20
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:12,500
but they also spray a certain linen
scent into every one of their stores.

21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,720
Why?
Why not just let the linen smell like

22
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:15,231
linen?
I mean,

23
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:16,910
there's,
there's certain marketing tactics these

24
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:21,911
brands use to try and generate a feel
sensory feel of psychological feel,

25
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,360
a belonging and community and ritual and
that that's,

26
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,150
that that's for the consumer.
It's that kind of sense of community

27
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,120
that,
that brands are after with lifestyle I'm

28
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,150
pitches.
Would that feel of being part of a

29
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:38,290
community around a brand.
Apple is another good example.

30
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,410
Nascar,
I mean these,

31
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:42,170
these,
these communities that bubble up around

32
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:44,860
popular brands and they tried to capture
that and then

33
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,520
sell,
sell you more products.

34
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:02,970
BMW,
Yoga,

35
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:03,690
wear

36
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,490
for clothing or Cheetos,
lip balm.

37
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,140
But,
but you know,

38
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,610
this,
this lifestyle stuff,

39
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,020
it does begin to.
It's corrosive to the,

40
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,050
to the sense of where our communities
are formed.

41
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:16,830
Are Our communities formed around brands
like apple now and Nascar?

42
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,090
Yes,
absolutely.

43
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,530
Absolutely.
You should.

44
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:20,041
They,
should,

45
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,000
they are,
they have,

46
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:26,001
they kind of become more virtual and
more online and brands are set up to

47
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,340
kind of put tolls around those
experiences.

48
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,900
And also,
you know,

49
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,860
also true.
I think,

50
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,040
um,
the,

51
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,933
the,
the,

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
the damage to how we relate together as
people and how we form relationships.

53
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:44,220
And think of ourselves even in terms of
our identity and our self esteem or

54
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:45,020
aspirations.

55
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,590
It is largely influenced by marketing.
Now more important than ever.
