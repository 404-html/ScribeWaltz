1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,060
Unfortunately,
I think everyone thinks they're funny

2
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:10,380
maybe.
And so few people actually are,

3
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:13,290
I think there's a certain type of bully
humor,

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,530
bullies throughout history and including
people who have become some of the most

5
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:20,910
powerful people in the world.
You know,

6
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:25,911
they just use their humor to make other
people feel small and to be like every

7
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:30,630
joke they they make is at someone's
expense.

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,080
And um,
almost bragging about how much more

9
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:39,081
powerful they are then the other person.
And that to me is not the greatest sense

10
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:44,250
of humor to have because um,
while it's fun to slam your friends,

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,490
I think,
um,

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,670
you really don't have a lot of empathy
for the,

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,750
for the bully who's using humor.
I think the instinct to be self

14
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,990
deprecating starts when you're young
and,

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,610
and you know,
you,

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,480
you don't take yourself too seriously
when you're not popular in the world and

17
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:03,210
your peers don't seem to be taking you
seriously.

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,040
You know,
I remember in high school for some

19
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:10,041
reason I just heard that there was a
huge dude who was,

20
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,600
who really didn't like me,
who wanted to beat me up as far as I was

21
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:16,710
concerned.
I had never met him,

22
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,770
but it was just one of those things
where he had found someone smaller than

23
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:27,441
him to pick on.
And so I remember just using humor to

24
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,820
disarm him and like he got in my face
one day and I just was like,

25
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,830
come on man.
I started,

26
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:37,020
I started acting like really huge and
tough.

27
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,011
I'm like,
come on,

28
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:39,900
I'll take you down.
Come on Bro.

29
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:44,880
Come at me Bro.
And he just started laughing and was

30
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:45,390
like,
Ha,

31
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,360
you're funny man.
And then after that we were friends.

32
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,450
I was getting mugged once and um,
I just ended up talking to the guy for

33
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:57,330
20 minutes and I'm trying to make him
laugh.

34
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,560
And at the end of it he was like,
ah,

35
00:01:58,561 --> 00:01:59,820
you're too nice of a guy.
All right,

36
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:02,100
I'll see you later.
That's sort of skill,

37
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,240
um,
can really come in handy when you feel

38
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:11,190
as if the world is against you in a way
to not take yourself seriously.

39
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:12,360
I think the,
the,

40
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,710
the world then has empathy for you.
You always see it when you're taking a

41
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:18,420
public speaking class.
They always say,

42
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:20,820
start off with a joke.
Um,

43
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,073
you know,
it's,

44
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,880
people don't want to have lives where
they're sitting there being bored by

45
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:28,530
people all the time.
And you know,

46
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,650
when,
when you're in charge of a company,

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,640
people usually hate their boss because
they're mean all the time.

48
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:38,880
You know,
humor is a great tool to use to just get

49
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:40,320
people on your side.

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,400
Mm,
okay.
