1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,100
Definitely do not get sucked into the
mindset that these things are inherently

2
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:08,340
top heavy or front end costly or
anything.

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:12,330
It's absolutely not true.
It was possible to do it much more

4
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:15,780
efficiently than a lot of people told us
was the case.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,840
When we surveyed the landscape of what
was out there in this particular sector,

6
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:24,480
even of it stuff,
and we dug around a little to sort of

7
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:28,740
investigate what kind of costs labor,
what goes into this.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,160
We were pretty stunned to find out what
people were spending on the front end to

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,360
engineer these things,
put them up.

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,600
We had a really hard time figuring out
what people were spending all that money

11
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:42,480
on to create,
we think very bad products.

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,870
What is possible for a young person with
an idea in terms of executing it today

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,340
even more than five years ago,
certainly more than 10 years ago in

14
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:56,730
terms of the speed with which you can
engineer things,

15
00:00:56,731 --> 00:01:00,900
the software that's available in an open
source way for you to construct these

16
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:02,190
things.
Suffice to say,

17
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:07,191
I think if people knew what it took,
what it costs us to set crowdrise up,

18
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,610
they'd be staggered.
I think it's like fractional compared to

19
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:14,490
some of the other big name things that
you've heard about.
