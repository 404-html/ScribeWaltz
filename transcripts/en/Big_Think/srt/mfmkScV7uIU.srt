1
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,980
It's odd that I've written two novels
out of 12 about Americans who leaves

2
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:19,450
this country and go and live in Canada
and stayed there.

3
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,760
Um,
although,

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,600
uh,
the characters who do that are very

5
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:29,950
different and their reasons for doing so
are also different.

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,190
Uh,
the reasons are political and the case

7
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:35,380
of Johnny,
we'll write the narrative of a

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,720
peripheral and meaning.
Um,

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,900
he does hate this country.
That's not the case for Danny Boucher.

10
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,040
Lupo and his dad,
they're fugitives.

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,290
They're running away.
It's not their choice,

12
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,600
uh,
to go to Canada.

13
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,260
Although it does become Danny's choice
to stay.

14
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,390
Um,
I couldn't do that.

15
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,610
I couldn't do it primarily as a writer.
I think if I'm going to continue to pick

16
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:14,310
on my country in some way as a writer,
uh,

17
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,700
I better live here.
I better be here firsthand.

18
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm not as an expatriate.
Um,

19
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,720
so I would disagree with the Ketchum
character,

20
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,140
uh,
in last night in twisted river when he

21
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:34,141
tells Danny that he should leave the
country and stay away.

22
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,350
Uh,
I,

23
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,940
I would disagree with that.
Um,

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,310
in my case,
in my case to,

25
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,770
unlike Danny,
I have three children and four

26
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,570
grandchildren.
I'm not going anywhere.

27
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,200
Um,
I live part time in Toronto because my

28
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,450
wife is Canadian.
Um,

29
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,490
but I'm,
uh,

30
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,770
I'm an American and I,
I always

31
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:03,310
will be.
I remember thinking in the last years of

32
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:08,311
the Vietnam War that I would never see
this country as divided again as it was

33
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,210
in those years.
But I was wrong.

34
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,960
I think,
um,

35
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,350
we as a people or more divided today,
um,

36
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,860
I think back in the latter years of the
Vietnam War,

37
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,340
it was chiefly that war that divided us.
I don't think it's fair or enough to say

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,320
that we are divided today because of,
or only because of the wars in

39
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:42,810
Afghanistan and in Iraq.
I think there are other deep political

40
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:49,110
and cultural rifts in this country.
A Conservative,

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,400
liberal riffs,
religious and not religious rifts.

42
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:01,770
I think there are any number of
differences among Americans that a

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,320
divide us,
um,

44
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,320
angrily,
uh,

45
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,680
and sharply.
Um,

46
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,190
and um,
you know,

47
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:14,851
boy,
I,

48
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:17,450
um,
uh,

49
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,810
I,
I really,

50
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:21,570
um,
have the highest hopes,

51
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,730
uh,
for,

52
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,710
uh,
President Obama.

53
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,100
I,
I'm a,

54
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,120
I'm very excited about him,
but he has inherited such a mess,

55
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,120
such a turmoil that
I hope people

56
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,660
will give him time
to sort it out and to undo at least some

57
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,070
of the damage that George W Bush did to
this country.

58
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,760
And I'm,
I think I'm already too old to

59
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,720
realistically imagine that even if Mr
Obama is hugely successful,

60
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,280
that he can actually undo all the
damage.

61
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,590
Um,
George W dot Bush did to this country's

62
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,650
reputation to the way we are seeing a
outside of this country to the way other

63
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:39,321
people in the world,
a CIS maybe that can be recovered or

64
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,610
that reputation that we once had,
can be regained that good reputation.

65
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,090
Uh,
maybe it will be regained in my

66
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,020
children's lifetime,
but I,

67
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,700
I don't expect
to see it

68
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,730
happen.
There is,

69
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:59,550
of course,
a lot of anti Americanism around the

70
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:04,220
world that is simply a hostile,
uh,

71
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,490
and vehement.
Uh,

72
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,080
and I'm motivated
by the desire to see any democratic way

73
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:16,770
of life.
I'm destroyed.

74
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,130
Um,
but there's another kind of anti

75
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:22,610
Americanism that we have,
um,

76
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,050
contributed to.
Uh,

77
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,033
and,
uh,

78
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,540
it,
it,

79
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,880
it embarrasses me.
I'm,

80
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,230
I'm,
I am sick of seeing,

81
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,090
um,
this country's a bully,

82
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,600
patriotism,
uh,

83
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,560
used as a smokescreen and as a cover up
for things we haven't done right.
