1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,003
Yeah,

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,510
there are two possible ways to extend
your life with action that you take

3
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:16,590
today.
One is to do things that allow you to

4
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:21,591
maintain your health for a longer period
and the other is to act to hyphen that

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,760
referred so that the time when therapist
come along,

6
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:30,780
which can rejuvenate you and give you
another leaf of life,

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,620
come along in time for you.
Even if you are going downhill.

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,810
Those two things are additive,
so to speak.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,050
They're independent criteria.
Now it turns out that the first

10
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:42,990
criteria,
and there's not much we can do unless of

11
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:47,991
course you are unusually for particular
age related problem like you know some

12
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:51,780
people come down with type two diabetes
and the 13th no drugs for that.

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,060
If you are the sort of normally healthy
person who has natural lifespan is going

14
00:00:57,061 --> 00:01:02,061
to be her more than there is nothing to
speak of that we can do that will extend

15
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:06,990
your life by an appreciable amount or at
least that is proven to have jobs to be

16
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:07,824
able to do that.

17
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,190
So we have to look at number two and
number two,

18
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,490
the situation is completely different.
It doesn't matter who you are,

19
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:19,260
whether you're a scientist or a
broadcast or a journalist or a general

20
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:21,060
member of the public,
it doesn't matter who you are.

21
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:25,910
You can make a difference by
contributing to the enthusiasm and

22
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,980
society for this work,
by changing the mood of the fatty and

23
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:35,910
thereby changing the funding environment
so the work will be done more quickly.

24
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,050
Oh,
I personally,

25
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:39,810
for example,
don't get enough sleep because I'm

26
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:41,520
traveling all the time.
I'm on the road.

27
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:46,521
I'm trying to get this stuff to happen
and from a purely health point of view,

28
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:48,990
that's probably bad to me.
It's probably shortening my life,

29
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,910
but I'm pretty sure that I'm bringing
forward the day when the therapist will

30
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:56,490
arrive by a larger amount that I'm
filling in in my life,

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,180
but even in my own personal selfish
turned on probably winning.

32
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,480
And of course I'm not only doing it for
selfish reasons.

33
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,080
I'm doing it to save your life as well.
