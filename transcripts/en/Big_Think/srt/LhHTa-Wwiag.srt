1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,913
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,540
sick one hero I would mention
as Galileo and the reason,

3
00:00:15,321 --> 00:00:17,870
the reason for that and the reason I
think,

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,320
at least to my mind,
uh,

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:24,370
he's the greatest scientist,
is it the way we do science now is to

6
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:32,501
actually have ideas that we can test
with experiments and it's this,

7
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,810
it's called the scientific method.
So critical to making science more than

8
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,650
philosophy.
And I think in earlier civilizations,

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,950
the Greeks,
the Romans,

10
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:48,770
the greatest minds of philosophers,
uh,

11
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,120
like just sort of intuitive things,
you know,

12
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,060
here's the way things must be,
uh,

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,600
and of course that's a recipe for making
a lot of mistakes and for having a,

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,500
a false impression of the world.
And what Galileo did was to say,

15
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:10,010
okay,
I have an idea,

16
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:14,360
but I think the way to go is to do
experiments and,

17
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,010
uh,
to test the ideas.

18
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:21,011
And that I think is,
is the bedrock upon which a modern

19
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:24,350
science is built.
Also.

20
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,300
I mean,
he,

21
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,120
he took a lot of heat for what he did in
his lifetime,

22
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,870
uh,
from the Catholic Church and uh,

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,070
and he was operating under a pretty
extreme circumstances.

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,750
And given those circumstances,
I think you performed pretty darn well.
