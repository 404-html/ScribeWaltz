1
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,050
Well,
management is focused on efficiency and

2
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:19,691
results.
Leadership is focused on adjusting the

3
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:24,890
change,
long term goals,

4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,750
uh,
on what are the B I and they were both,

5
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:31,730
by the way,
there really are three categories.

6
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:35,210
They are both distinguished dramatically
from administration.

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,760
So there's really administer
administration,

8
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:40,400
management and leadership,
not just leadership and management.

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,630
And an awful lot of our people,
including many of our people in top

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,750
offices are extremely confused about
this and have administration all

11
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:55,250
confused with management and leadership.
And that's a big problem that we have

12
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:56,084
right now.

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:02,530
Okay.
