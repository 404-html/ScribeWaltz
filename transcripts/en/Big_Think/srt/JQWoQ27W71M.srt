1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,833
Yeah.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,080
Noncommunicable diseases are the
diseases that you and I are most

3
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:16,560
familiar with.
There are things like diabetes and heart

4
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:21,561
disease and unfortunately I think that
if you run your hand over the planet,

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,570
you'll see that in the poorest countries
there's extremely little that's being

6
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:31,110
done across these dimensions.
These diseases are not getting the

7
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:36,111
attention that they deserve and yet they
are becoming a larger and larger piece

8
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:42,150
of the puzzle of public health.
So in Rwanda and Kenya and Ethiopia and

9
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:44,190
a number of countries where I've worked
over the years,

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,230
we've seen large numbers of new type one
and type two diabetes coming through the

11
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:51,120
door.
Just a couple months ago,

12
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:56,121
I was out at a health center where a man
who was suffering with type one diabetes

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,280
was actually living at the health center
because he didn't have the authority to

14
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:04,590
provide himself with daily injections of
insulin.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,280
Of course,
this would never happen in the u s or in

16
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,300
a rich country.

17
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,930
He'd get his needles and he'd get his
insulin and he'd be able to inject

18
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:16,290
himself at home.
But where there is care that's given,

19
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,090
it's given without very much instruction
or very much knowledge of these

20
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:24,540
diseases.
One of the perhaps best interventions

21
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:28,860
that we can make as a world today in the
area of public health is around these

22
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:31,800
noncommunicable diseases.
We've actually got to start taking a

23
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:33,960
look at heart disease and poor
countries.

24
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,920
I know that in China for example,
heart disease has become one of the top

25
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:40,680
killers in Rwanda,
in sub Saharan Africa.

26
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,750
Uh,
heart disease is a major killer,

27
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:45,990
but it's a bit of a silent killer
because people haven't attracted over

28
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:50,880
the years it hasn't been as interesting,
nor has it attracted as much donor

29
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:54,030
dollars as something like aids,
tuberculosis or malaria.

30
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,630
And yet it's still claiming a huge
number of lives and a lot of

31
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,450
productivity.
Even though we don't have the best of

32
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:03,630
baseline data,
we do know that the impact is enormous,

33
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:08,100
and we know that with changing diets and
poor countries with urbanization,

34
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,220
with increase in smoking and basically
bad rich country habits,

35
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,580
people are going to be getting sicker
and sicker earlier and earlier,

36
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,730
and now is the time to really prevent
this disease,

37
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:24,570
which is going to be the next wave of
pandemic that hits the way

38
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,620
[inaudible].
