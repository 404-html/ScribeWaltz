1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,933
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,390
the methods of developing drugs is sort
of set up so that you know,

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,010
you,
you try to control for a similar group

4
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:18,230
of people and you give them a similar
pill,

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,820
you know,
but the deal is,

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,280
um,
we don't know anything about their

7
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:23,780
genetics,
you know,

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,950
so maybe they have these certain enzymes
in their body that like,

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,110
really,
you know,

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,270
turn this drug over and turned it into
the active metabolite,

11
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:33,950
for example,
that helps you.

12
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:39,320
Or maybe you're a bad metabolizer and it
builds up in your liver and causes

13
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:44,240
problems.
I'm the deal is the pharmaceutical

14
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:47,240
companies would rather have,
um,

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,080
have their market not limited by 66
percent.

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,070
They would just like to sort of create a
drug for everybody,

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,740
throw it out to the mass,
the masses.

18
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,760
And I'm,
if it improves symptoms by five percent,

19
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,110
well it's a drug and it's done its job.
Um,

20
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,540
but it actuality,
whenever you look at it across the

21
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,910
population,
there's a significant amount of people

22
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:15,911
that are harmed by that drug.
The FDA tries to eliminate that as much

23
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:18,010
as possible.
Um,

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,940
but you know,
it doesn't always work.

25
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,170
I think that there are certain drugs
that are,

26
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,730
uh,
that we should not be taking.

27
00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:28,860
Absolutely.
Uh,

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,710
in 2009,
the FDA approved only 26 drugs,

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,990
uh,
70 percent of those were me too.

30
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:38,560
Drugs,
drugs that were going off patent and

31
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,890
needed to be remarketed as you know,
the next purple pill,

32
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,500
for example,
in order to create,

33
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,680
you know,
a $400 a month blockbuster drug,

34
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,270
a in exchange for a $4 a month generic.
Um,

35
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,700
I think that that is a very,
very,

36
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:57,910
very shady practice and it's harming our
health,

37
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,740
uh,
in exchange for,

38
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,950
um,
creating a whole industry of

39
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,820
profitability off selling snake oil and
marketing gimmicks.
