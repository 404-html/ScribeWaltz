1
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,590
Well,
the American theater is lousy with

2
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:14,340
hidden gems,
but I think in particular there are a

3
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:16,980
lot of place.
What used to be,

4
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:18,720
well,
they're still called wellmade place,

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,430
the thirties and forties that fell out
of fashion when the fashion and American

6
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:28,431
theater turned towards more personal
expressionistic playwriting at Tennessee

7
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:32,520
Williams really marks the big change in
direction here.

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,450
Uh,
there's still a lot to be said for the

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,900
wellmade witty,
clever three act comedy.

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,450
Uh,
uh,

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,760
there's a playwright named sn Bearman,
Sam Bearman,

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,350
who wrote these kinds of,
of social comedies that are actually

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,090
extremely sharp and,
and,

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,360
and still quite provocative.
Uh,

15
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:57,270
he has a play called biography,
which is about to be produced off

16
00:00:57,271 --> 00:01:00,900
Broadway that I'm going to see that I've
actually seen that produced an excited

17
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:01,790
by it.
Uh,

18
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,540
John Ruetten,
another purveyor of wellmade boulevard

19
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,200
theater that's actually much more
challenging and interesting than you

20
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:10,860
might expect.

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,770
There's a wonderful play called the
voice of the turtle three character play

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,970
that has never had a modern production
on the east coast so far as I know,

23
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,190
uh,
the British playwrights,

24
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,120
terence Radigan in particular who,
who are also totally unfashionable

25
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:28,140
because of their,
their being rooted in traditional ways

26
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:31,350
of play construction.
I'm not saying that this is the best or

27
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:34,500
the only way to write a play.
I like Tennessee Williams as much as the

28
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:37,950
next guy and Sam Shepard and,
and all sorts of different ways of

29
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:42,951
writing plays,
but I don't think that that what worked

30
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:46,560
in the thirties and forties should be
disregarded simply because it is no

31
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:49,410
longer fashionable.
And that's something that I sort of

32
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:53,370
crusade for in my own writing.
I look for productions of playwrights

33
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:54,204
like that.

34
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,770
David cromer from Chicago I think is the
most gifted young director in America.

35
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,760
He had a real setback.
He just made his Broadway debut last

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,990
month with the what was supposed to be a
repertory production to Neil Simon plays

37
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:13,900
and they closed it after the first one
opened and before the second one got

38
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,940
open.
That's not going to stop him.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This is a guy who is his imagination
just oozes out of his pores.

40
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,460
He did an off Broadway production of our
town,

41
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,320
uh,
last season.

42
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:28,750
It's still running in which he played
the stage manager.

43
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,530
Nowadays,
everybody seen our town.

44
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,940
Your high school did it.
You probably did it when you were in,

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,060
in high school.
It is an utterly familiar play and

46
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:41,320
cromer without distorting it,
without transforming it,

47
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:46,321
beyond recognition made an absolutely
new and fresh and every moment of it was

48
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:48,580
alive.
He did the same thing with the

49
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:52,510
production of the glass menagerie that I
saw in Kansas City last year.

50
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,380
The same thing with the production of
William enjoys a picnic that I saw in

51
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:58,920
Chicago two years ago.
Uh,

52
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,650
I got onto him because I travel in.
Most other critics don't.

53
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,030
And so I was aware of him earlier than,
than he was generally known in New York.

54
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,120
And now he,
he is at the top of the list of

55
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:13,120
directors whose work I will travel to
see.

56
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,740
He excites me.
