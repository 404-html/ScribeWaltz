1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,010
Well there is,
there is no doubt that the whole

2
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:19,011
discussion globally about how to deal
with the climate crisis is still,

3
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,680
uh,
for most people,

4
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:25,690
the most essential part.
And it's,

5
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:30,691
it would be very unfortunate unless we
find ways to deal seriously with the

6
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:35,460
climate crisis and to present it
because,

7
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:36,450
uh,
that,

8
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,420
eh,
unless that happens,

9
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,500
we certainly are not going to see
sustainable development as we look

10
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:48,501
ahead.
I think,

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,830
Eh,
basically when you look at all the

12
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:55,770
elements that,
that are on the table and in the

13
00:00:55,771 --> 00:01:00,390
discussion even linked up to the climate
change discussion,

14
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,410
all the key issues linked to the
sustainable development concept itself

15
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,580
are part of that discussion.
So it's not as if something has been

16
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:19,251
completely lost as we focus on climate,
because in the whole area of adaptation,

17
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,980
uh,
of,

18
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:27,120
uh,
all the sectors that need to be involved

19
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,160
to deal with,
uh,

20
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,580
reducing the impact of on our climate,
we touched most issues which are

21
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:37,530
relevant in a sustainable development
context.

22
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,240
Well,
I think whether you look at the,

23
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:45,570
the,
the question of,

24
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:48,820
uh,
the way our democracies,

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,350
most countries are today.
Democracies,

26
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,510
although not all,
uh,

27
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,590
democracy means public participation.
And it means at the same time elected

28
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,040
representatives and a democratic
institutions that can help safeguard the

29
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:13,621
way that people live together and the
way we live in relationship with the

30
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:18,730
surrounding world and our environment.
So whether you look at it at national

31
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:23,731
level or at the global level,
there is this direct link between public

32
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:29,221
participation and engagement and the way
that leaders who have been elected,

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,410
uh,
or who are at least in any case,

34
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:34,780
responsible for the future of their
people,

35
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,990
how they can act together and,
uh,

36
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:43,180
have addition and,
and method of moving ahead in a

37
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:45,670
consistent and sustainable manner.

38
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,930
I think it's true to say that,
um,

39
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,650
a lot of politics and the positioning
and different,

40
00:02:56,651 --> 00:03:00,940
uh,
national interests and perspectives have

41
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,050
entered into this global and very key
issue.

42
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,650
Uh,
this happens in many cases were

43
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:13,651
important issues are at stake.
So it's not something I'm only specific

44
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,770
for the climate issue.
But here you have major powers and you

45
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:23,200
have major sectors,
uh,

46
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,020
businesses,
uh,

47
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,940
which have been used to having a strong
influence,

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,811
uh,
in,

49
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:33,811
in many countries.
And they all are positioning themselves

50
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:38,270
and pushing for their own interests,
uh,

51
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,320
even short term.
So there is a challenge to people across

52
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:49,621
the world to look beyond this and the
challenge to leaders as we saw happening

53
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:52,930
in Copenhagen,
by the way,

54
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,560
that they have to put their heads
together and feel responsible as a team

55
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,140
across borders,
not just,

56
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,053
uh,
do,

57
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,070
uh,
politicking in their own national

58
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:06,700
framework.
