1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,100
Okay.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,270
No,
I think it's easy to create a straw man

3
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:11,130
to attack game theory.
Uh,

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,870
and if you literally think that the
payoffs are you written down are

5
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:17,530
completely right,
uh,

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,820
and that the other play and all the
players are identical,

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,140
uh,
you will come up with a really stupid

8
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:23,270
answer.
Uh,

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,113
that is,
uh,

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,950
this leading,
uh,

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,740
and that I think is a,
uh,

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,690
is a poor application of gain through.
And that's also why we call the book the

13
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:32,210
Rd strategy.
Uh,

14
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,100
there is a science behind it,
but sometimes it's used,

15
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:38,940
uses a dialogue.
It's providing a common language so that

16
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:42,900
we understand the reason why we think
somebody is going to take this strategy

17
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:46,890
is because they see all of these
different options playing out in this

18
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:48,450
way.
Do you agree with that?

19
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,300
Where is our,
our conclusion falls from our

20
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,670
assumptions.
So now we can understand,

21
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,260
do we have a common set of assumptions?

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,820
But this article pointed out something
else that I think is even more

23
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:03,450
important,
that there's multiple levels of game

24
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:07,230
theory.
And I like to think of us as metagame

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,113
theorists,
uh,

26
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,550
or it's not just about solving a
particular game.

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,800
It's about making sure you're playing
the right game.

28
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,850
And so,
uh,

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,600
now how do you go about designing a
game?

30
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,900
And you could think about that.
You can change the rules of the game.

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,710
You can change the players in the game,
you can change the payoffs in the game.

32
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,090
You can link one game to another game.
So you need to understand some game

33
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:33,240
theory to figure out when I'm doing my
game design,

34
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,420
are these changes likely to help me or
likely to hurt me?

35
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,260
And I think in the end,
I'm not going to be so precise to say

36
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:44,160
it's going to be 7.36,
5% improvement,

37
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,610
but it's a good idea to link these two
negotiations.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,760
What isn't a good idea to link these two
negotiations?

39
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,760
And that's the level at which I think we
can be

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,460
very helpful.
