1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,070
Nowadays,
it's incredibly hard to stay focused.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,620
There's so many distractions that are
around us at any given moment.

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,960
Um,
your pocket vibrates at any given

4
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:14,850
moment.
A cause bigger,

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,370
getting 10 new emails and on social
media there's all these new

6
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:21,820
notifications and the phone is ringing
and your kids need help and your

7
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:24,920
colleagues are coming up because you are
working in an open office plan and

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,520
they're asking you to chime in on some
memo.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,480
Maintaining focus nowadays is harder
than ever before,

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,540
but in some ways it's way more critical
to,

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,110
one of the things that we know about the
most productive people and the most

12
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:43,111
productive companies is that they create
ways to enhance their focus.

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,060
They,
they manage their mind in such a way

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,590
that they're able to focus on what's
important and ignore distractions much

15
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:53,290
better.
And the way that they do this is by

16
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:57,700
what's known as building mental models,
essentially telling themselves stories

17
00:00:57,701 --> 00:01:02,350
about what they expect to see,
engaging in this kind of inner dialogue

18
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,610
about what they think should be
happening that allows their brain almost

19
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:10,510
subconsciously to figure out what to pay
attention to and what to ignore.

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,690
One of my favorite examples of this is a
big study that was done of nurses in

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,530
Nicu as some researchers from a group
named client associates went into some

22
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:25,090
hospitals because they wanted to figure
out why some nurses were so good at

23
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:29,950
paying attention to the right things,
whereas others got distracted by all the

24
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:34,060
noise and bustle around them.
And what they found is that the best

25
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,570
nurses in Nicu is,
which is the neonatal intensive care

26
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:42,520
unit who are handling these babies.
The nurses who are almost had a sixth

27
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:46,360
sense or an esp about figuring out which
babies were sick and were getting

28
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:49,480
sicker.
We're the ones who were constantly

29
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:52,240
telling themselves stories about what
they expected to see as they were

30
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:57,241
walking around the hospital.
So one of my favorite interviews from

31
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:59,800
this study was with a nurse named
Darlene.

32
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,440
Darlene said that what she would do is
that she always was keeping a picture in

33
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:09,910
her brain of what she thought that the
perfect baby should look like.

34
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,830
And so she would walk through the unit
and she would notice when babies didn't

35
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:17,140
kind of match that picture in her brain.
Right.

36
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,750
And they would match.
They would mismatch that picture and

37
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:23,050
kind of odd ways.
Like she might be walking past a crib

38
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,460
and she might expect a baby to be crying
because babies cry all the time.

39
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,310
And so if a baby was being uniquely
silent,

40
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,370
she would go over and she would try and
figure out what's going on.

41
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:37,360
Like why is this baby being so quiet now
to all the other nurses are quiet baby

42
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:40,570
seems like a good thing.
It seems like that baby is happy and it

43
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:43,630
doesn't need any attention.
But to Darlene because she has this

44
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:47,890
picture in her head of what the perfect
baby should look like when she sees a

45
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:51,070
quiet baby,
she thinks that doesn't match the

46
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:51,730
picture in my head.

47
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,210
I need to go pay attention.
And so she'd walk over and she'd see all

48
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:58,360
these things that are all small issues
on their own,

49
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,820
right.
The maybe the baby's blood was taken

50
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:04,750
from its heel and instead of a dot of
blood on the bandaid,

51
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,580
if there's a little bit of a bigger
splotch,

52
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,840
um,
maybe the,

53
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:09,610
the baby's temperature is a little bit
elevated,

54
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:13,120
but nothing that like is out of place.
Nothing that's worrisome.

55
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,650
But for Darlene and nurses like this who
keep this picture in their head,

56
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:20,500
this mental model of what should be
occurring,

57
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,500
all of those things don't jive with the
story inside their head.

58
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,740
And so as a result,
their attention is grabbed by it and

59
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:31,270
they start saying to themselves,
why?

60
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:33,550
Why is this baby bleeding a little bit
more than I expected?

61
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,400
Why is its temperature off just a few
degrees?

62
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,610
And in this case,
they discovered that the baby was

63
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:42,850
incredibly sick.
Now there was not a lot of evidence that

64
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:43,684
it was second.
In fact,

65
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,660
if they had waited half an hour,
45 minutes more,

66
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,970
the baby actually probably would have
passed away.

67
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,510
But because Darlene noticed all of these
things because the baby that she was

68
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:55,330
seeing in real life didn't match the
picture in her head.

69
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,080
She acted immediately.
They started,

70
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,870
they started the child on antibiotics.
The sepsis infection in its system was,

71
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,650
was stamped out,
but the only reason that Darlene was

72
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:10,450
able to notice these warning signs,
the only reason she sort of had this esp

73
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:14,620
or sixth sense for something going wrong
was because she had a strong mental

74
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,230
model.
She had a picture in her head that she

75
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,510
was comparing reality too.
Now,

76
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,510
not all of us work in Nicu is right.
We don't work in hospitals.

77
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,980
We're not dealing with life or death
issues,

78
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:29,190
but think for a minute about what it's
like when you walk into a meeting and

79
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:33,450
your boss asks you an unexpected
question or you're,

80
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,110
you're,
I'm sitting there and you're,

81
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:39,340
you're juggling the kids and dinner and
suddenly your phone vibrates and it's

82
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:42,340
this email that's,
that causes the spike of panic.

83
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:48,210
Our instinct at a moment like that is to
react immediately to type something that

84
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:52,960
we end up regretting later on or to
answer our boss and blurt something out

85
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,610
and we think to ourselves afterwards,
God,

86
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:56,710
I could've put that so much more
eloquently.

87
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,900
Why are some people so much better at
maintaining their focus and not reacting

88
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,150
and not getting distracted by all these
things?

89
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,190
It's because ahead of time they've
envisioned what they expect to it to see

90
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,710
they've envisioned what they expect to
occur.

91
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,920
So on the subway,
when they're riding to work,

92
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,410
they think about what is this day going
to be like?

93
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,320
I know that I'm going to this meeting.
What do I expect to occur at that

94
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,450
meeting?
And so when they walk in and their boss

95
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:25,330
asked them some unexpected question,
they their brain,

96
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,680
almost subconsciously,
he says,

97
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,460
I didn't expect that question to occur.
This isn't matching the picture in my

98
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:33,970
brain of what I anticipated.
So I need to put that question off.

99
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:36,790
I need to to say,
can we take that offline and I'll answer

100
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,460
that later.
Or they have a picture in their brain of

101
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:42,400
what it's going to be like to to deal
with the kids and to make dinner.

102
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,130
There's some type of expectation and so
as a result,

103
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:47,560
when their pocket buzzes and an email
comes in,

104
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,330
they can say,
I can't handle this right now.

105
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:52,690
I need to give myself five minutes and
I'll deal with this later.

106
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,420
I use this all the time.

107
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,890
They used to be that when I would ride
the subway into work,

108
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,210
I would spend that time reading the
paper or I would try and get caught up

109
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:02,871
on,
you know,

110
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:07,871
memos or or something else.
What I do now is I put everything away

111
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,660
and I spend that 30 minutes just trying
to envision what is this day going to be

112
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:18,890
like because I know that the more that I
have thought through what's about to

113
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:22,430
occur,
the more that I have a strong vision in

114
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:25,280
my mind of what I should expect and
anticipates,

115
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,260
the more my subconscious is going to be
able to decide this is what you should

116
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:33,110
focus on.
This is what you can safely ignore.

117
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,450
I'm trying to train my brain by just
doing a couple of minutes of thinking

118
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:43,451
through what's about to occur to make
better decisions about where my focus

119
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,080
should actually be.
Go.
