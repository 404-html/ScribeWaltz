00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,790
What I love about this notion of
multitasking gives people brag about how

2
00:00:03,791 --> 00:00:05,530
good they are at it.
In fact,

3
00:00:05,531 --> 00:00:08,260
it's a lie,
it's a lie we're telling ourselves over

4
00:00:08,261 --> 00:00:10,830
and over again.
I have a friend named Janice Marturano

5
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:15,370
who is a former executive at general
mills and she now teaches meditation to

6
00:00:15,371 --> 00:00:18,550
corporate executives all over America
and all over the world and she pointed

7
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:21,910
out to me,
multitasking is a computer derived term.

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,810
Computers have many processors.
We have only one processor.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,830
We literally neurologically cannot do
more than one thing at a time.

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,470
So every time you think you're
multitasking,

11
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,800
essentially that's a short way of saying
you're doing many things poorly.

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,140
What I've learned to do,
and it's hard,

13
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,200
it's to try to do one thing at a time.
So if I'm on the phone,

14
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,400
I turn off my computer monitor and
actually listen radical as it may sound

15
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:47,110
to the person to whom I'm speaking.

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,500
If I'm working on a story at work,
writing a story,

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,970
I shut down my email and try to actually
focus on what I'm doing.

18
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:59,710
And what I found is that I moved through
my tasks in a much more rapid way and a

19
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:02,230
much more effective way,
and I'm doing a better job now.

20
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:04,780
I'm not gonna lie to you.
There are times when we have to

21
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:07,000
multitask.
There's no question about it.

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,570
Things get so hectic in my office,
and I'm sure in the lives of anybody

23
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,550
who's watching this,
we're multitasking becomes,

24
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,890
uh,
impossible to avoid.

25
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,220
I found myself walking down the hallway
the other day with a glass of water

26
00:01:18,221 --> 00:01:22,270
hanging out of my mouth,
and I'm typing away on my blackberry and

27
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:25,330
walking at the same time.
So I'm a huge hypocrite on this score.

28
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:27,940
There's no question about it,
but I do my best to avoid it because I

29
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:30,730
know I do my best work when I'm only
doing one thing at a time.
