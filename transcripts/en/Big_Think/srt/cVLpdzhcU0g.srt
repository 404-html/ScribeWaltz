1
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,430
What is the best sort of life for a
human being?

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,720
Socrates claimed in 400 BC that a man
lives a happier life if he's just,

3
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,910
even if he's thrown starving into prison
for the rest of his life,

4
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,660
then if he's unjust and he celebrated
and honored all of his days and his

5
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:37,830
never caught for his crimes,
could that possibly be correct?

6
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,340
If not,
why not?

7
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,920
And what difference should the question
make to us?

8
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:46,570
Now?
What moves the human heart?

9
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,120
Shakespeare's characters throw us into
the depths of lust,

10
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,250
envy,
greed,

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,960
pride,
ambition.

12
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:02,010
What are those characters have to say
about the way that we act or that we

13
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:06,900
behave or that we believe?
And if so,

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,110
what difference would it make to read
about them in Shakespeare?

15
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,540
Why Shakespeare,
who is Elizabeth and English is very

16
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:18,541
difficult for us who speak moderating
which to understand Thomas Hobbs road in

17
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:24,151
1651 a book called Leviathan,
one of the two or three most influential

18
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:30,871
works in the history of thinking about
government and politics in Western

19
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,810
society.
He was writing from the midst of a

20
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:39,811
raging civil war and he argued that
unless we gave all the power,

21
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,080
unless we surrendered all ultimate
control to a legitimate king,

22
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,390
that we would all rob and kill each
other.

23
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:54,670
Was He right about that?
Is that the way things actually work and

24
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,770
is the question relevant to us today
when we no longer believe in kings?

25
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,350
Hello,
my name is Jeff Brenzel and I'm the dean

26
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:07,960
of undergraduate admissions at Yale
University.

27
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,900
I lecture from time to time in the
philosophy department at Yale and my

28
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:19,901
work in philosophy centers around ethics
and also the history of the ideas that

29
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:24,080
we've had about something we'd like to
call human nature.

30
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,730
Speaking of human nature,
one of my personal heroes,

31
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,820
aristotle claimed that by nature
everyone seeks to know everyone desires

32
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:39,330
to know.
For the purposes of this talk,

33
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,390
I'm going to assume that you are already
an intellectually curious person and

34
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,680
that you're not only chasing after
knowledge as hard as you can.

35
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,090
You're also trying to build up the skill
sets and acquire the kind of capacities

36
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:56,620
and abilities that you're going to need
to become a better learner overall.

37
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,920
If these things are in fact about you,
then here's my advice in a nutshell.

38
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,790
Make a choice in college to read some
old books,

39
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:19,110
even a substantial number of old books.
My argument will be that reading the

40
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:25,831
right old books in the right way is
better than reading only new books,

41
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,660
much less using only new ways of
learning that have nothing to do with

42
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:34,810
books at all.
But let's be careful about what I'm

43
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:39,220
claiming and what I'm not claiming.
I'm not claiming that you should read

44
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,370
only all books,
uh,

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,730
or that old books are better because
they're old.

46
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,060
Uh,
or that you should never read any new

47
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:54,061
books or that new books are worthless.
Only that you should read and learn how

48
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:59,491
to read some old books,
but which ones would those be?

49
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,550
How do you learn how to read them in the
right way?

50
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,570
Why should you read them in college and
how could doing that change your life

51
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:10,444
for the better?

52
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,200
How is that going to make you smarter?
And Moreover,

53
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:21,130
how's it going to make you wiser?
The dialogues of socrates,

54
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,330
Aristotle's ethics,
oedipus rex,

55
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,380
the city of God,
Leviathan,

56
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,050
Dante's inferno,
King Lear,

57
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:35,830
Paradise Lost Warren piece.
There are a lot of these books,

58
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,180
but why spend a significant amount of
your time on books that by definition

59
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,190
are outdated?
Why not go after the books that bring

60
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:52,210
everything up to date?
Don't we know everything those people

61
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,850
already knew and much,
much more.

62
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,780
So a little personal background here.
I went off to university in 1971 no one

63
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:05,110
in my family had ever graduated from
college,

64
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,300
much less a place like Yale.
I had never visited across the state

65
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:12,010
line.
I never reviewed,

66
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:17,130
had even been on an airplane before.
The one that swept me off to uh,

67
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,520
to new haven,
Connecticut.

68
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,910
Now when I actually showed up at Yale,
I applied in total ignorance and almost

69
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:29,620
by accident to a special freshman year
program called directed studies.

70
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,880
So what is directed studies and directed
studies?

71
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:38,881
You take three full year courses in the
history of Western thought and

72
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:42,970
philosophy and literature and in
politics,

73
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,080
you start with what the classic Greeks
had to say,

74
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,090
and then you roll forward with the
centuries until you end up about a

75
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,090
century behind where we are right now.
There is no textbooks,

76
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,870
there's no summaries,
there's no cliff notes.

77
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,690
You read only the original works.
And it was both the single most

78
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:09,470
difficult and the single most
transforming educational experience that

79
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:12,830
I've ever had.
About 15 years ago,

80
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,070
I came back to Yale after founding
companies managing organizations,

81
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,010
uh,
and after earning a phd in philosophy.

82
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,670
And I'm having the opportunity there
today to teach in this very same program

83
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,510
that I took over 30 years ago.
So I've gotten to know these classic

84
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:35,990
works fairly well,
have become familiar with them.

85
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,980
Uh,
I've seen their effects on students,

86
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,520
um,
and I've had the chance to stack them up

87
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:48,140
against my own life experience and stuff
that I've read from lots of modern

88
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:52,310
books.
So here I am ready to give you some good

89
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,190
reasons to look into the classics
yourself.

90
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,090
Now,
the first thing to point out is

91
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:06,500
something that I think you already know.
There are a lot of books out there and

92
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:11,400
you don't have much time.
The Library of Congress has over 20

93
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,310
million volumes.
That's the largest library in the world.

94
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,030
That's not counting the journals,
the publications.

95
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,720
It's not counting the Internet.
It's not counting the blogs.

96
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:25,920
It's not counting with wikipedia is not
counting the entire Google plex.

97
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,470
Meanwhile,
down here on the personal level,

98
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,490
I'm 58 years old.
I've been a pretty strong reader for

99
00:07:32,491 --> 00:07:34,470
about 40 years.
Uh,

100
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:36,930
back home,
I've got a personal library of about

101
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:38,940
2000 books,
volumes.

102
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,710
And if you do the math,
that's about 50 books times 40 years,

103
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,070
50 books a year.
It's about a book a week.

104
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,510
I hope you can see the problem.
My problem,

105
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:55,950
which is also your problem,
which is we ain't gonna make it through

106
00:07:55,951 --> 00:07:57,420
the library of Congress.

107
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:03,410
Not only that,
we're not going to get to 99.99,

108
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,690
nine,
9% of everything that's ever been

109
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:08,780
written.
You know,

110
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,560
Mahatma Gandhi said,
live as though you'll die tomorrow,

111
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:19,070
but learn as though you'll live forever.
Gandhi was as aware as you and I are

112
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,330
that we're not going to live forever.
And of course,

113
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,810
um,
that means that you are going to have to

114
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:31,590
be extremely picky about what you choose
to read.

115
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Even if you live according to Gandhi,
you literally have no other choice.

116
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,010
But now it seems I've only made my job
harder because I've got to persuade you

117
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,000
that with this precious time that you
have for learning and study,

118
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,930
which is dwindling all the time,
uh,

119
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,600
that you're going to take some of it and
devote it to things that are.

120
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,120
Um,
so let's focus on the principle of

121
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:03,120
necessity.
And that means the principle of having

122
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:06,480
to make these difficult and time
consuming choices.

123
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,520
I'd like to give you five reasons,
five rough and ready criteria for

124
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:23,401
identifying a classic of literature or
philosophy or politics.

125
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,350
Now,
no one or two of these criteria are

126
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:28,420
going to be decisive,
but I think if you put them all

127
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:30,640
together,
they're going to prove actually to be

128
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:35,641
quite useful first.
The work addresses a permanent universal

129
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:40,270
concern about the human condition.
From the philosophical perspective,

130
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:45,070
it has something to say about the way we
should live from a literary perspective.

131
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,100
It helps us imagine different ways that
we could live and from a political

132
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:53,920
perspective or an historical
perspective,

133
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,220
it helps us remember ways that we have
lived.

134
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,970
So that's Martin number one of a classic
Martin.

135
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:03,940
Number two is that the work has been a
game changer.

136
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:09,510
It changed perspective or shifted
perspective on those issues both for the

137
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:14,740
earliest people who read the book and
also for those who came later.

138
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,160
Martin.
Number three is that the work has

139
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,250
stimulated or provoked or responded to
many other important works.

140
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,210
Martin.
Number four is that many generations of

141
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:32,860
the very best readers and the most
expert critics have rated the work

142
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:36,040
highly is one of the best and most
important of its kind.

143
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,460
Even if those reviewers,
those experts didn't agree on anything

144
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:46,420
else and even if they took our head a
violent argument with the work itself.

145
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,450
Martin,
number five is that the work usually

146
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:54,451
does require a strenuous effort to both
engage it and understand it.

147
00:10:55,090 --> 00:11:00,090
But rewards that great effort in
multiple ways and very highly.

148
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,670
Before we think about what these
criteria rule in,

149
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,320
let's think about what they rule out.
Let's say that you run up to me with a

150
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:18,210
novel that you picked up just last week.
You waving in the air and you say,

151
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,330
Professor Brenzel,
I've got a great book here for you.

152
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,380
It's an instant classic,
even better than Moby Dick,

153
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,160
maybe even better than moby Dick.
What am I likely to respond?

154
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,290
Well,
it may be in fact very good and your

155
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,720
recommendation may persuade me to read
it,

156
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:40,320
particularly if I have a high opinion of
you as an expert reader.

157
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,390
Your new favorite book May in fact
become a classic someday,

158
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,500
but
it hasn't changed.

159
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,020
The game is yet for other writers and
readers,

160
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,140
it hasn't provoked or influenced lots of
other works.

161
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,220
How could it,
you don't know how experts and other

162
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:02,860
readers are going to evaluate it over
time.

163
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,400
You're not even sure how you're going to
see the book over time,

164
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:12,090
but let's remember the critical problem
that we all have way too many books and

165
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:14,890
not nearly enough time.
So,

166
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:19,630
where are you likely to get the biggest
bang for your reading dollar and for

167
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:23,620
your reading hour,
something published last week or

168
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:28,621
something that stood the centuries of
tests by tough readers and that has in

169
00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:32,170
fact spawned a great deal of what you'll
be reading today.

170
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,950
So I'm sort of defining a classic as an
old book.

171
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,770
It's been through generations of
readers,

172
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,960
big game,
changing ideas,

173
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,570
uh,
and something that you can expect to

174
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:46,090
find to be a considerable challenge to
tackle.

175
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,540
So let's flush it out with just a few
examples,

176
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,820
uh,
before we talk about what good it's

177
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:54,190
going to do.
You to read such a book in a college

178
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,024
course.

179
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,010
Socrates was a philosopher who lived in
Athens,

180
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,580
ancient Greece about 400 years before
the birth of Christ.

181
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,810
You've probably heard his name,
even if you know nothing else about him,

182
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:17,010
you may also know that the other
citizens of Athens put him to death.

183
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,070
Uh,
because he went around asking a lot of

184
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,350
challenging questions,
needling people,

185
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,540
irritating them,
uh,

186
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,730
with questions about their actions and
their beliefs that they didn't care to

187
00:13:26,731 --> 00:13:28,080
answer.
Well,

188
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,680
it's a remarkable fact that for the past
24 centuries,

189
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:37,190
very few thinkers in the western
tradition have been able to avoid having

190
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:41,280
to come at some point to grips with
socrates and his life and his death.

191
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,790
It's even more interesting that
socrates,

192
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,600
so far as we know,
never actually wrote down a single word.

193
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,530
He strolled around the town,
uh,

194
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,390
embarrassing prominent people with his
questions.

195
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,330
He liked to say that the only
superiority that he ever claimed was

196
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:03,350
that he was absolutely certain that he
was ignorant,

197
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:08,010
but he found that people believe that
they knew all kinds of things and in

198
00:14:08,011 --> 00:14:10,050
that he was superior to them.

199
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,440
Now,
one of the young aristocrats who got a

200
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:15,190
big charge out of,
uh,

201
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:20,270
following socrates around the town was a
young wrestler named Plato,

202
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,600
maybe the first scholar athlete.
So Plato wrote a series of dialogues

203
00:14:27,121 --> 00:14:32,121
after socrates died that featured his
hero and the principal role,

204
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,980
the early dialogues,
uh,

205
00:14:34,981 --> 00:14:39,981
do seem to reflect for us this business
of walking around asking these difficult

206
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:44,670
questions that no one can answer.
Later in the later dialogues,

207
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:49,970
Plato begins to use socrates as a
mouthpiece or as someone who represents

208
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,600
the kinds of new questions that plato
himself began to ask under socrates

209
00:14:56,601 --> 00:15:01,601
inspiration to give me some indication
of how expert readers over time have

210
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:06,410
understood Plato's thought and its
central importance in the tradition.

211
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,600
The great 20th century philosopher and
mathematician Alfred North Whitehead

212
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:17,530
once said that all of western thought is
nothing more than a series of footnotes

213
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,900
to Plato.
Quite a claim and remember that it was

214
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:27,710
Plato's encounter was socrates that
inspired all of Plato's thought.

215
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,680
Now,
Plato's single most important dialogue

216
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
with socrates is the hero is a dialog
called the republic.

217
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,140
And in it,
Plato tries to formulate to basic

218
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:46,250
fundamental and universal questions.
What's the best sort of life for a human

219
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:48,350
being?
And beyond that,

220
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:53,380
what's the best society for producing
the conditions under which human beings

221
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,340
could live that kind of life?
These two questions give the book the

222
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:01,500
first mark of greatness that I was,
um,

223
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:05,840
that I was discussing,
which is the republic addresses

224
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,180
permanent and universal questions.
Ones that might puzzle you as much as

225
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:12,980
they did socrates.
And Plato.

226
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,460
The book opens with a really terrific
argument about justice,

227
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,290
whether it's the just or the unjust
person who gets the better of it in

228
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,950
life.
Software confronts a very sarcastic and

229
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:35,150
very aggressive young man named
[inaudible] who attacks the common

230
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:40,151
notion that justice is a virtue.
Listen then says through civicus I

231
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:44,480
proclaim that might is right.
And that justice,

232
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:47,180
as you call it,
is whatever happens to be in the

233
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:51,050
interest of the stronger.
There are different forms of government,

234
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,860
but they all make laws according to
their own interests.

235
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,810
Everywhere.
There is only one principle of so called

236
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,350
justice,
which is that justice turns out to be

237
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,000
whatever happens to be in the interest
of the stronger.

238
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,140
So have you ever heard someone make this
argument before?

239
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,990
That might makes right?
The justice has no fixed meaning that

240
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:22,280
what is considered just in a society is
just whatever the people running the

241
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:23,840
society say it is.

242
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,730
I'd be surprised if you hadn't,
because it's a universally recurring

243
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:32,270
argument,
not only throughout the dorms have any

244
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:35,200
good colleges down through time,
uh,

245
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,780
but also down through the centuries in
the debates of the very best

246
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:43,010
philosophers.
Now I can't do justice in this short

247
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:48,011
talk to even this relatively simple
opening framing argument of the republic

248
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,250
for Simica Socrates.
But essentially socrates tries to answer

249
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:59,251
it through civicus by pointing out that
we distinguished between good rulers and

250
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:02,280
bad rulers.
Just like we distinguish between good

251
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:06,990
shepherds and bad shepherds or good boat
captains and bad boat captains.

252
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,950
The good shepherds act in the best
interests of the sheep and the good boat

253
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:16,320
captains act in the best interest of
their boats and passengers.

254
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,720
So a ruler,
if he's right,

255
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:21,480
we named a ruler or she's rightly named
a ruler,

256
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,810
is someone who acts in the best interest
of the subjects and the bad ones don't

257
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,740
throw synagis calls this drivel.

258
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,780
He points out that the shepherd hardly
cares for the sheep.

259
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,780
He simply fattening them for the
slaughter.

260
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,190
Consider further,
most foolish socrates.

261
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:49,191
He says that the just is always a loser
and comparison with the unjust.

262
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,150
First of all in private matters,
wherever the unjust is the partner of

263
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:56,760
the just,
you will find that the unjust man always

264
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,910
gains more and the just man always gets
less.

265
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,320
Next in their dealings with the
government when there is an income tax,

266
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:09,060
the just man will pay more and the
unjust man less on the same amount of

267
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:11,910
income and when there is anything to be
received,

268
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,540
the one gains nothing.
The other gains much

269
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,470
okay.

270
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:25,470
By this standard for semigloss goes on
to say the best life is actually the one

271
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:30,751
to be had by the absolute tyrant who can
take anything that he wishes by force

272
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,560
and make everyone else pay honor and
obedience.

273
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,300
So not only is being a tyrant the best
kind of life,

274
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,640
all people would become tyrants if only
they could know.

275
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:48,790
Socrates at this point,
Knox through simic is down with some

276
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:52,690
verbal and logical tricks that I'm not
going to take you through in this talk

277
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,010
and outwitted through Simica stocks off
from the conversation,

278
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,000
not to return.

279
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,690
The young friends of socrates are not
satisfied with this outcome.

280
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,320
And they take up the core question,
but in a much harder for them.

281
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:15,430
They asked socrates to prove to them
that the just person is always happier

282
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,670
and always has a better life than the
unjust person.

283
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,460
No matter how poor,
deprived,

284
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:25,520
disgraced,
or reviled the just man might be.

285
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,130
And no matter how wealthy,
honored,

286
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:32,090
and completely unharmed an unjust man
might be.

287
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:37,780
So the rest of the republic is Plato is
attempt to answer this question along

288
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:41,870
with a number of other questions.
In the course of it,

289
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:45,680
he draws a surprisingly compelling
picture of human psychology.

290
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,910
He,
on the nature of knowledge,

291
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,740
he presents a proposal for the ideal
state and he polishes it all off with a

292
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:57,370
theory about enlightenment and about the
ultimate nature of reality.

293
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,160
Along the way,
he speculates about the relations

294
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:04,090
between men and women,
how to raise and educate children to be

295
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:09,091
good citizens and the right way for
human beings to investigate questions of

296
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:10,084
all kinds.

297
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,490
Now,
Plato himself had a brilliant student

298
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:15,070
named aristotle who for my money,
uh,

299
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,400
actually surpass plato and a number of
different ways,

300
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,980
but was certainly heavily influenced by
Plato.

301
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:26,110
So let me just give you a very quick
notion of how things play out and the

302
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:30,580
history of thought for Plato's and
Aristotle's thinking and in fact,

303
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:35,581
for your own
first,

304
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:39,910
they're thinking stays very much alive
in Greece,

305
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:44,911
in Rome for 400 years until the coming
of Christ and beyond that for many

306
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,660
centuries more if you happen to be a
Christian,

307
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,060
what you think of is Christianity.
The very concepts and ideas that form

308
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:59,530
the basis for Christianity actually turn
out to owe a great deal to plato and

309
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:02,710
Aristotle.
Virtually everything that Christianity

310
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:05,860
teaches about God,
about human nature,

311
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,920
about human fulfillment arises from what
the historians of religion like to call

312
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,720
the marriage of Jerusalem and Athens.

313
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,410
That is the marriage of Greek and Jewish
thinking.

314
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,070
One big moment for this process comes
about eighth centuries after Plato and

315
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,040
Aristotle for centuries after Christ,
when a man named Saint Augustan writes a

316
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:33,100
truly monumental work in the history of
Western thought.

317
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,920
A real classic,
the city of God.

318
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:41,430
He writes this book just as the Roman
Empire is collapsing around his ears

319
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,500
from invasions of barbarians.
Augustan was very influenced by platonic

320
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:51,430
thinking,
even though he wasn't all that familiar

321
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:55,510
directly with Plato's works,
and he sets the course of Christian

322
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:58,360
thinking for a very long time.
In fact,

323
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,600
if you're knowledgeable about the
history of Christian doctrine or

324
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:03,220
Christian theology,
uh,

325
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:07,090
you'll know that augustine is
influential right up to the current

326
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:12,091
moment.
Then another 800 years after Sandy

327
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:16,860
Gustin,
a priest around the year 1215 named

328
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:21,870
Thomas Aquinas rediscovers,
many of the last works of Aristotle.

329
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,760
To put this very briefly,
he puts together the thought of

330
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:32,530
Aristotle with the thought of Augustan
comes up with a new synthesis for

331
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:35,890
Christian thinking,
and it turns out to be a game changer.

332
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,410
The result is for the most part,
what the Roman Catholic Church teaches

333
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:44,500
to this very day,
Saint Thomas Aquinas,

334
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:49,310
the primary Orthodox theologian of
Catholicism.

335
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,800
Meanwhile,
the Italian poet,

336
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:56,210
Dante,
who lives one generation after aquinas

337
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,900
reads aquinas is influenced by his work.
And as one of the three or four greatest

338
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:08,081
poets ever to live,
presents us with his own view of human

339
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:09,590
nature,
fulfillment,

340
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,730
and human destiny.
When he writes his three epic poems

341
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:15,980
about Hell,
Purgatory and heaven,

342
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,970
uh,
you've probably heard of Dante's

343
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,880
inferno.
So now fast forward another 250 years

344
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,790
and we come to about the year 1500
Martin Luther in Germany.

345
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,510
Now,
luther gets very angry about a lot of

346
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:34,670
things that are happening in the
Catholic church.

347
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,180
He goes back and rips aquinas apart.
He trashes aristotle and he returns for

348
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:46,601
his inspiration to the game changing
works of Saint Augustine and Saint Paul.

349
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,320
By doing this,
luther also starts a process that

350
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:55,490
splitters Christianity into a million
pieces,

351
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,703
game changers.

352
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,510
Another hundred or so years after
luther,

353
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,040
we have John Milton.
Milton is an English poet.

354
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:12,050
He takes his inspiration from the
reforming of Christianity,

355
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,130
the Protestant reformation,
and he writes the greatest epic poem in

356
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:18,830
the English language.
Paradise lost.

357
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,510
It gives his own picture of the
Protestant picture of human nature,

358
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,030
human history,
human destiny,

359
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,620
God's will.
So if you happen to be a Catholic and

360
00:25:30,621 --> 00:25:35,360
you believe that the Catholic Church
teaches the same thing always in

361
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:37,940
everywhere and has from the very
beginning,

362
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:43,690
or if you're an evangelical Protestant
and you believe that all of your own

363
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:49,450
views come directly from a plane,
a straight forward reading of New

364
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,610
Testament texts.
In either case,

365
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:56,990
you could not be more mistaken.
The very teachings of the Catholic

366
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,620
Church or the very ways that a
Protestant Christian interprets the

367
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:05,621
words of the Bible and scripture results
from speculations and collisions taking

368
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:11,780
place among ideas that involve plato,
aristotle,

369
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,300
Augustan,
Aquinas,

370
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,640
St Paul,
Dante,

371
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,130
Martin Luther,
and Milton.

372
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,360
Here's a very small example of something
quite specific.

373
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,110
Many Christians believe that Satan,
the devil,

374
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:31,670
was once a great arcane joe in fact,
that he was the highest of all the

375
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:36,590
angels and that his name was Lucifer,
and that he rebelled against God in

376
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:39,500
heaven before the creation of the entire
world.

377
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,960
Later,
he successfully tempted our first

378
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:45,810
parents and Adam and eve to eat an apple
in the garden of Eden.

379
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:51,260
There's actually remarkably little in
the Hebrew scriptures about Satan and

380
00:26:51,631 --> 00:26:55,080
what's there does not happen to include
these beliefs.

381
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:00,000
The same as we imagine him is actually a
much later invention.

382
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:05,210
And he's not thought of as either a
fallen angel or even fully identify with

383
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:11,061
the serpent in the garden who tempt Adam
and eve to taste the fruit until four

384
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:16,581
centuries after the life of Christ.
Augustan has a lot to do with who Satan

385
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:22,620
becomes and the picture that you
yourself may have in your mind of a

386
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:26,310
rebel angel,
a war in heaven between the good angels

387
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,900
and the bad angels.
Well,

388
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:32,250
that's something that John Melton,
imagine for us when he published

389
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:35,190
paradise loss in 1667,

390
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,120
socrates and Plato and aristotle exert
influences in many other threads or

391
00:27:48,681 --> 00:27:52,670
conversations or discussions that are
taking place in the western history of

392
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,260
ideas.
For instance,

393
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:59,470
the encounter was socrates enters very
strongly into soren kierkegaard is work

394
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:03,350
in the 19th century.
Kierkegaard is the Godfather of

395
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:05,140
existentialism.
Uh,

396
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,800
ultimately kierkegaard produces all
these other philosophers like heidegger

397
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:14,801
and Sartre.
Socrates also provoked and gave shape.

398
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,690
Um,
in an encounter,

399
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,970
a philosophical encounter,
uh,

400
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
gave shape to Friedrich Nietzsche's
thought also in the 19th century as

401
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:30,011
Nietzsche actually seeks to try to undo
a what he considers to be the disaster

402
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,580
that socrates has bequeath to Western
civilization.

403
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So you simply cannot study the history
of western thought without running into

404
00:28:41,031 --> 00:28:44,660
Plato and socrates just around about
every corner.

405
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,680
You can't,
uh,

406
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:52,190
read a thinker who hasn't been
influenced himself or herself by these

407
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:56,030
ideas in some way,
as well as the way that they actually

408
00:28:56,031 --> 00:28:57,710
pose the original questions.

409
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,140
What's the best sort of life for human
being?

410
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,830
Uh,
and what's the best kind of society in

411
00:29:03,831 --> 00:29:08,420
which that sort of life can be lived.
So the republic is still what I would

412
00:29:08,421 --> 00:29:12,740
call a living book.
It's still fuels and counters.

413
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,740
It's still provokes us,
provokes,

414
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,290
uh,
students in my classroom.

415
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,810
I think just as much as socrates
provoked them,

416
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,490
uh,
in the streets of ancient Greece.

417
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,590
Uh,
it has something to teach us.

418
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,330
It has something to connect us very
deeply to the ideas of many others.

419
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,090
Uh,
it's something that's made our society

420
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:37,330
in some very deep respects what it is.
He might say that Plato,

421
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,940
uh,
and his inspiration,

422
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:42,280
soccer teas are the opposite

423
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,350
of outdated thinkers

424
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,540
on this.
Um,

425
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,640
rather a quick dash through the
centuries.

426
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,480
Uh,
I've not forgotten the question that I'm

427
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:59,940
supposed to answer,
which is,

428
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,990
so what,
why does it do you any good to know

429
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:08,170
these things?
What's all this about strenuous effort

430
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,050
and what's that got to do with something
being a classic?

431
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,560
Aren't there any classics that are easy
to read,

432
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,210
uh,
or to cut to the chase and regarding all

433
00:30:17,211 --> 00:30:21,340
of the strenuous effort?
Why do I really have to dig in to

434
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:25,420
Plato's Republic at all?
Why can't I just hear about it from you?

435
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,540
Or why can't I read the cliff notes
version?

436
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,650
Or why can't I find a summary or a
digest or look on my neighbor's notes?

437
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,160
Um,
why won't wikipedia tell me everything

438
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,700
that is truly important for me to take
away from the book?

439
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:43,900
Why can't I take the,
take advantage of the fact that all

440
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:47,530
these other people have read it or
commented on it and used it for some

441
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:49,960
purpose or another?
What's the takeaway?

442
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,470
Well,
the 20th century philosopher and critic

443
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:55,210
Mortimer Adler,
uh,

444
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,050
put it this way,
the path of true learning is strewn with

445
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:01,270
rocks,
not roses,

446
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:06,460
but I am still saying he goes on that
the great books can be read by every

447
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:08,680
person.
In one sense.

448
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:11,110
Of course they are the most difficult to
read,

449
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:16,470
but they are in another sense the most
readable both for the less and the more

450
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:21,490
competent reader because they are the
most instructive.

451
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,940
What Adler is,
uh,

452
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,890
is trying to tell us here,
um,

453
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:31,950
is that uh,
just because something is difficult

454
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:36,610
doesn't mean that the time you spend
with it is not worthwhile.

455
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:41,380
And in fact that any amount of time that
you spend with one of these kinds of

456
00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:46,381
works will actually be more valuable to
you then the same amount of time that

457
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:49,210
you spend on homework of lesser quality.
But,

458
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:53,080
uh,
what Adler wants us to understand a is

459
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:54,940
the principle of no pain,
no gain.

460
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:58,340
And in fact that in the case of,
uh,

461
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,120
works of the mind that,
uh,

462
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:05,050
whatever the pain you experience,
whatever time and study that you're

463
00:32:05,051 --> 00:32:08,920
going to give to these works,
these works pay a greater return.

464
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:10,960
You might say they have a higher
interest rate,

465
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,900
uh,
then the ordinary stocks and bonds that

466
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:16,120
you're going to be exposed to and the
rest of your courses.

467
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,640
So what I'm going to do now is to try to
give you five takeaways,

468
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,230
uh,
that is five valuable things that are

469
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:31,300
specific to you,
uh,

470
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:36,330
that you can pull out of these books and
take away with you to the other things

471
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:39,440
that you're studying and also to your
own life.

472
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:45,080
Number one,
the value of forgotten ideas.

473
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:48,920
Some old ideas are not actually
outdated.

474
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:54,050
The entire period that we call the
European renaissance actually consisted

475
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:58,910
of people rediscovering a bunch of ideas
from the ancient world and giving them a

476
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:03,440
new application.
So point number one is some of these old

477
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:06,260
ideas are actually valuable.
Number two,

478
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,740
the value of making connections between
ideas.

479
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,700
There is less new under the sun than
what you might think.

480
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:19,030
And seeing the connections that tie one
thinker to another in a tradition,

481
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:24,050
uh,
also gives you a measure of how far

482
00:33:24,051 --> 00:33:29,051
we've come on some problems and what
problems seem to have heavily resisted,

483
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,510
uh,
the attempts of human beings to give

484
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:33,344
them answers.

485
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,410
Um,
the one that we've been considering from

486
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:38,810
time to time through the course of this
talk is one of those,

487
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:41,060
what's the best sort of life for a human
being?

488
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:45,350
This is a question that you'll be asking
yourself as you try to figure out things

489
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:48,050
like where am I going to get a job?
Where am I going to live?

490
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:50,540
Who am I going to marry?
How am I going to raise my children?

491
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,780
Um,
these are questions that are permanent

492
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:58,810
aspects of the human condition.
You're also going to discover that this

493
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:02,610
is not the kind of question in which
science has suddenly dl,

494
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,930
you know,
delivered a fantastic new answer.

495
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,940
People have been asking and answering
this question for a long time and

496
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:15,920
looking at some old thinkers can see you
can help you see the connections between

497
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:19,280
the ways people originally asked these
questions and the way we do.

498
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,940
But also give you a perspective on
what's been solved,

499
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,970
which in some of these cases is very
little.

500
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,890
Um,
and uh,

501
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:31,670
what remains for you to consider an
actually,

502
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,210
um,
determine by the way that you live your

503
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:38,090
own life.
The third thing is that great books of

504
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:43,091
the past are going to engage you with a
number of great minds who don't share

505
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:47,360
any of your assumptions.
Just as we were talking about with

506
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:49,010
Plato,
it's a different culture,

507
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:50,810
a different morality of different
religion,

508
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:55,070
a different politics call this,
the value of strangeness,

509
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:59,270
which is not only an additional
perspective on what you believe,

510
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,910
uh,
but I'm going to claim is also a primary

511
00:35:01,911 --> 00:35:06,911
source of human creativity.
The fourth value is quite frankly,

512
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:10,400
the value of building up your
intellectual muscle power.

513
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:15,170
You don't get to be a better wrestler by
a wrestling all the little kids in your

514
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:18,110
neighborhood and beating them up and
sending them home crying.

515
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,810
Uh,
if you're going to be a better wrestler,

516
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,500
you're going to have to get your own
nose bloody by going up against people

517
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:28,430
who are bigger and stronger and better
than you are.

518
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,320
So finally,
five,

519
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,800
there is the value of forming better
judgments.

520
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,520
Once you've encountered with the best of
all and wrestle them to the ground,

521
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:44,400
you're going to be much better position
to make your own good discerning

522
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:49,401
judgments about where to spend your
precious time without having past

523
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:54,471
generations of experts to do the reading
you might say ahead of you and post the

524
00:35:55,621 --> 00:36:00,621
signs without knowing how a book is
going to influence other books and,

525
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,860
uh,
without,

526
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,170
uh,
yourself being able to figure,

527
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,310
um,
what the,

528
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:06,091
um,
uh,

529
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:09,420
what the views are going to be of this
book in the future.

530
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:14,400
Uh,
you will be able to tell junk from gold

531
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:18,060
trash from something that's worthwhile.
Why?

532
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,960
Because you'll know when you're actually
up against,

533
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,070
uh,
uh,

534
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,670
a real mind.
You will have experienced the best that

535
00:36:26,671 --> 00:36:27,504
we know.

536
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:38,050
So let's dig down a little bit into the
value of some old and outdated ideas.

537
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,200
A man named malthus in 1798 published a
classic work in political economy.

538
00:36:44,961 --> 00:36:48,770
It's called an essay in the principle of
population.

539
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,650
Now,
the basic idea is that populations can

540
00:36:51,651 --> 00:36:55,730
only grow up to the point where they
necessarily collapsed because of limited

541
00:36:55,731 --> 00:36:58,310
resources,
a famine and disease.

542
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,330
But the essay explores the ideas and a
lot of very interesting ways.

543
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,620
And actually it was a major influence on
Charles Darwin and the development of

544
00:37:06,621 --> 00:37:10,640
the theory of evolution.
Despite the game changing nature of this

545
00:37:10,641 --> 00:37:13,550
work,
economists and scientists of the

546
00:37:13,551 --> 00:37:16,790
industrial age have generally held that
malthus was fraud.

547
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,640
Why?
Because he predicted we were all going

548
00:37:19,641 --> 00:37:23,950
to die back in the 18th century.
He thought that we were going to outrun

549
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,630
the food sources with our population,
uh,

550
00:37:26,631 --> 00:37:29,870
and that nothing could stop a headlong
rush over the cliff.

551
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:36,250
What he did not take into proper account
were the game changing aspects of human

552
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:41,420
ingenuity and creativity that would find
a way around resource bottlenecks.

553
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:46,520
Now during the oil shocks of the 1970s.
And if you go back and look for this,

554
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,160
uh,
you'll see that the ideas of malthus

555
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,710
came very much back into view.
Why?

556
00:37:51,711 --> 00:37:55,880
Because people were seeing resources
begin to run out.

557
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:01,180
The world's population had doubled over
a period of about 30 to 60 years and it

558
00:38:01,671 --> 00:38:03,680
was going to going to be set to double
again.

559
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:07,760
So Thomas Malthus and his ideas about
what happens when you increase the

560
00:38:07,761 --> 00:38:12,080
population past the carrying load came
around for more currency.

561
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,960
Today.
If you google the name Malthus,

562
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:18,470
you're going to get over 3 million hits
on the Internet.

563
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:24,730
His fundamental ideas are once again at
the center of debates about peak oil,

564
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,120
environmental damage,
global population,

565
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:34,640
the prospects for global catastrophe,
Malik doozy and ideas are everywhere and

566
00:38:34,641 --> 00:38:39,641
his work being invoked as people wonder
if the world is about to prove mouth

567
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:41,440
this right in the end.

568
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,353
Okay,

569
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:52,710
here's another example of old ideas
being mined for new insights in ancient

570
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:56,830
Greece.
Aristotle wrote a book called when the

571
00:38:56,831 --> 00:38:59,800
comic can ethics or for short the
ethics,

572
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,600
it's actually a book about human
happiness and about what it takes to be

573
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,950
a happy person.
Now,

574
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:10,951
we don't ordinarily associate the idea
of ethics with a work on happiness.

575
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:14,740
We think about ethics as being things
like moral obligations,

576
00:39:14,741 --> 00:39:16,310
duties,
um,

577
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,970
what were,
what were called upon to perform.

578
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:23,971
Despite our desires to do other things.
Aristotle had a different perspective on

579
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:29,650
this.
He was an original proponent of the idea

580
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:33,850
and you may have heard this idea that
virtue is its own reward.

581
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,480
Then in fact,
the things that make you an excellent

582
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,760
parent,
th th the the things that make you an

583
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:44,761
excellent citizen are also the things if
pursued consciously and done well,

584
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,910
make you a happy human being.

585
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,200
In other words,
that there's a dedication to excellence.

586
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,500
We're excellence consists of the virtues
that are required for us to live well

587
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,940
and do well with one another.
Uh,

588
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,130
that is the foundation for human beings
to be happy.

589
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:11,730
This goes these days by the name virtue
ethics and philosophers and

590
00:40:12,071 --> 00:40:16,750
psychologists all over the world are
studying what makes for human happiness.

591
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:21,430
Aristotle actually has something
extremely contemporary to contribute to

592
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:23,680
that debate.
So again,

593
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:28,860
reading these works gives you a very
different sense of what progress

594
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:33,070
consists of in one whole area of human
thought.

595
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:38,340
And even our notion of progress might
mean when we start to talk about

596
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:42,760
something like human happiness are,
they're really new messages coming from

597
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:43,923
the,
uh,

598
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,990
from the cosmos about what it takes to
be happy.

599
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,063
Okay.

600
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:56,930
My third value or take away,
uh,

601
00:40:56,931 --> 00:40:59,780
involved what I call the value of
strangeness.

602
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,540
Now,
this one's a little harder to explain.

603
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:06,200
So let me use an analogy.
You've probably traveled.

604
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,500
People like to travel.
Some people travel a great deal.

605
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,410
What do people feel like they learned
from traveling,

606
00:41:12,411 --> 00:41:17,411
particularly travel to another society?
One of the things that good travelers,

607
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:23,090
people who have done this well and spend
enough time in a foreign society to

608
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:28,091
really learn something about it,
they generally say that they're struck

609
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,640
by the ways that,
that society is different from our own.

610
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:36,950
And they're struck by the kinds of
answers that people give to questions

611
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:37,941
that,
uh,

612
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:40,880
we suddenly discover.
We've made a lot of assumptions about

613
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:45,620
that is we've made an assumption about
our lifestyle or an assumption about

614
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:48,920
what people want out of life or an
assumption about how people are going to

615
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:53,921
get those things that actually isn't an
operating in this other society at all.

616
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,360
And of course it might make us stop and
think,

617
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,110
is our way of doing this actually the
best way of doing it?

618
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,020
Might I pick up some ideas from this
other place?

619
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:07,370
Well,
great books can have some of this same

620
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,400
effect through the value of strangeness.
Let's consider two women writers for a

621
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:17,570
moment.
And if you've been paying attention,

622
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:21,500
you might have noticed that I haven't
talked about any women thinkers or

623
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:24,230
writers up to this point.
And in that regard,

624
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:27,260
it's important to remember that until
very recent times,

625
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:32,150
very few women had access to the kinds
of educations or were given the kind of

626
00:42:32,151 --> 00:42:36,060
encouragement to engage in this kind of,
uh,

627
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,930
thinking or this kind of work or this
kind of reading,

628
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,760
uh,
as they are today.

629
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,740
So you might say,
ah,

630
00:42:42,741 --> 00:42:45,240
it's only very recently,
uh,

631
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:50,260
that women have entered a,
this long conversation.

632
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,620
Uh,
why?

633
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:56,650
Because they were excluded from Jane.
Austin was a brilliant novelist and what

634
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:03,200
Jane austen wrote about were the manners
and the ways of life and the,

635
00:43:03,201 --> 00:43:06,170
uh,
marriage and family arrangements of

636
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,760
English country gentry of the late 17
hundreds.

637
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:16,120
Now it's very unlikely that you're going
to have much knowledge about the ways of

638
00:43:18,081 --> 00:43:22,670
life that were current among the English
gentry in the late 17 hundreds.

639
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,680
And,
uh,

640
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:28,010
that is just what makes encountering
them valuable and what makes

641
00:43:28,011 --> 00:43:33,011
encountering Jane austen herself
valuable for she knows this world and

642
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:37,730
these people inside and out.
And she's an exceptional,

643
00:43:37,731 --> 00:43:42,380
clever and devastating observer of the
human heart.

644
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:47,830
You come to know both the world that
these people occupied and the ways in

645
00:43:48,411 --> 00:43:53,411
which they occupied this world in a way
that nature that no other author,

646
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:56,570
uh,
is ever going to reveal or take.

647
00:43:56,571 --> 00:43:58,490
Another example,
Emily Dickinson.

648
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,550
Now,
Emily Dickinson was one of the two or

649
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:04,820
three master poets that the United
States has produced.

650
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:10,510
She had an even more narrow and an even
stranger world to show us consisting

651
00:44:11,241 --> 00:44:15,860
primarily of the workings of her own
mind and her emotions,

652
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,070
which were exceptionally focused and
intense.

653
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:24,820
It was Dickinson or virtual reckless who
said partying is all we know of heaven

654
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:32,140
and is all we need of hell.
She also said one need be a chamber to

655
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:35,940
be haunted.
And also this,

656
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:41,790
an ear can break a human heart as
quickly as a spear.

657
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:47,870
We wish the ear had not a heart.
So dangerously near Reading Emily

658
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,440
Dickinson,
we'll introduce you to a mind and a

659
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:55,350
heart that simply does not work well.
Have you hearts.

660
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,560
It doesn't work like mine,
but she knows yours and she knows her

661
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:05,160
own as well.
Thoughts like Dickinson's and like

662
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:09,720
Austin's can dislodge us from the
everyday world.

663
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,550
Uh,
the things that we're familiar with,

664
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,330
um,
and the ways that we tend to find it

665
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:20,280
natural to think,
but isn't that the value of an education

666
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,950
and isn't one of the most practical
things,

667
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,180
um,
uh,

668
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:24,871
that,
uh,

669
00:45:24,871 --> 00:45:27,120
that the world is seeking the world of
business,

670
00:45:27,121 --> 00:45:29,580
the role of law,
world government,

671
00:45:29,581 --> 00:45:32,280
the role of the arts,
even the world of academia,

672
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:38,030
aren't they seeking for people who take
up new and strange and different and

673
00:45:38,311 --> 00:45:40,860
creative perspectives?
In other words,

674
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:45,600
isn't this takeaway from these great and
classic works maybe among the most

675
00:45:45,601 --> 00:45:47,490
practical things that they have to have

676
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:48,383
offers?

677
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:58,430
My fourth value involved a building your
muscles and your reading skills and the,

678
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:58,991
uh,
the,

679
00:45:58,991 --> 00:46:02,130
the ways that you're going to tackle
increasingly difficult material.

680
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:05,220
Now,
I don't think this one requires

681
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:08,340
illustration so much as it does a
reminder.

682
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,860
As we said,
you don't get to the Olympics by

683
00:46:10,861 --> 00:46:15,861
training with weaklings and these works
have survived in part because they've

684
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:17,790
ripped,
been written by geniuses.

685
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:20,310
That is,
we know that these are mine's worth

686
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:25,311
wrestling with because so many have the
good news is that does not mean that you

687
00:46:25,831 --> 00:46:29,160
have to be a genius to understand them.
Thank God.

688
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,170
Or I wouldn't have made it very far
myself.

689
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,420
Uh,
you've heard the saying,

690
00:46:33,421 --> 00:46:37,140
she got to where she is by standing on
the shoulders of giants.

691
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:42,590
So here are the giants master the skills
that it takes to get up on their

692
00:46:42,811 --> 00:46:46,740
shoulders and you're going to see quite
a distance.

693
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,830
Um,
you'll see more than they saw.

694
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,200
Uh,
you'll also be prepared,

695
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:55,200
better prepared to grapple with lesser
works,

696
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,880
uh,
that don't stand

697
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:57,763
this tall.

698
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,600
So for the fifth value,
I said that to the extent that you

699
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:09,540
encounter engage classic work
successfully,

700
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:14,580
you'd be a better judge of modern works.
And my example here has to be

701
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,140
Shakespeare.
Now,

702
00:47:16,141 --> 00:47:19,710
many of the greatest critics and readers
of world literature,

703
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:23,040
including across cultures and across
boundaries,

704
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,250
have had the same basic view of
Shakespeare.

705
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,500
And that is whatever his flaws,
uh,

706
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:33,940
whatever the weaknesses and whatever the
strengths of other writers.

707
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:39,270
I know one no literary giant has ever
written more profoundly or more

708
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:45,751
inventively or more imaginatively about
the human condition than Shakespeare.

709
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,950
Harold Bloom,
the great literary critic critic where I

710
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,710
work and teach here at Yale,
uh,

711
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:57,970
called one of his books on Shakespeare,
the invention of the human.

712
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,390
And he meant by this,
that Shakespeare with these characters

713
00:48:01,391 --> 00:48:06,391
like falstaff and hamlet and king lear
quite literally created around the year

714
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:12,490
1600 our modern sense of what it means
to be a human being,

715
00:48:12,491 --> 00:48:14,230
acting and thinking in the world.

716
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:17,640
Many of his hundreds of memorable
characters,

717
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:23,040
men and women either vividly or
unexpectedly respond to their life

718
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:27,300
situations in ways that we couldn't
predict or typecast,

719
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,200
uh,
or they open up new perspectives on what

720
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:36,201
truly motivates each of us.
So once you have successfully engaged

721
00:48:36,901 --> 00:48:38,400
Shakespeare and his,
uh,

722
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:42,270
in his comedies and in his tragedies,
you're going to very quickly since,

723
00:48:42,271 --> 00:48:46,950
and other writers,
whether or not they're capable of doing

724
00:48:46,951 --> 00:48:49,620
the same thing,
and if they are,

725
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,570
you're going to be drawn on to read
them.

726
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,800
And if they're not,
you can safely set them aside because

727
00:48:55,801 --> 00:48:58,100
you've got a better standard,
uh,

728
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,820
against which to make your choices.

729
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,240
Let's say that you're persuaded of these
five valuable things that I say you can

730
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:13,830
take away from these work if you include
some of them on your course schedule in

731
00:49:13,831 --> 00:49:18,831
college.
Could your life be better personally if

732
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:22,080
you invited some of these authors into
it?

733
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:25,830
And how so?
So think about it like this.

734
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,280
I shared an experience a number of years
ago when my son got involved.

735
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:35,370
Uh,
and I got involved as well in the boy

736
00:49:35,371 --> 00:49:36,780
scouts.
Uh,

737
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:37,950
we hiked,
we camp,

738
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,610
we make friends.
Um,

739
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:43,020
W we had lots of families and the troop,
lots of other,

740
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,640
uh,
other adults on the trips.

741
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:46,440
Um,
uh,

742
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:48,150
it was all fine.
It was wonderful.

743
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:53,730
But then we came to a point in the
development of these young men and their

744
00:49:53,731 --> 00:49:57,900
skills where we were prepared to
introduce them to something more

745
00:49:57,901 --> 00:50:01,410
adventurous.
And we planned a two week wilderness

746
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,830
expedition,
something that we hadn't come close to

747
00:50:04,831 --> 00:50:06,750
doing a with these young men before.

748
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:09,100
I was very excited.
Uh,

749
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,930
it was something that I had done and I
wanted my son to have the same

750
00:50:12,931 --> 00:50:17,931
experience as I had had.
So let me get this straight.

751
00:50:18,241 --> 00:50:21,540
He said,
we'll have to carry twice the weight on

752
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:24,660
our backs that we ever have before,
including the food.

753
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,090
The food is going to be pretty bad.
We're going to have to purify every

754
00:50:29,091 --> 00:50:31,850
single drop of water.
We drank a,

755
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:35,660
we'll have to figure out our own trail.
It's going to be in rugged mountains.

756
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:38,510
We'll probably spend some time getting
lost.

757
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:43,670
What exactly am I going to get out of
this that I can't get from the hiking

758
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:47,990
and camping that we've already done,
which I've liked perfectly fine and

759
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:50,120
which we did without all this pain and
hassle.

760
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,360
Smart boy.
Good questions.

761
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,700
So I finally said,
you know,

762
00:50:56,150 --> 00:51:00,110
I don't think I can really tell you what
you're going to get out of this.

763
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:04,370
You have to experience it for yourself.
And then you'll know.

764
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:07,610
So I guess I'm just asking you to trust
me on this.

765
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:13,940
So my son Paul certainly had some
skeptical company among the other scouts

766
00:51:13,941 --> 00:51:16,130
and the troop.
And sure enough,

767
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:20,210
a few days into this expedition,
things began to deteriorate.

768
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:23,000
We had some lousy weather.
Uh,

769
00:51:23,001 --> 00:51:24,530
there's blisters,
uh,

770
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,420
people are hungry.
Uh,

771
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:30,740
the boys are a ragging on each other.
No one's really getting along.

772
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:32,330
Um,
and,

773
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:33,470
uh,
my son,

774
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,990
uh,
is looking at me with those all knowing

775
00:51:35,991 --> 00:51:40,991
eyes of a 16 year old.
But then the boys started to toughen up.

776
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:46,190
The weather cleared.
We got higher up in the mountains.

777
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:50,180
They started to rely on each other more.
They figured out how to break camp

778
00:51:50,181 --> 00:51:53,830
efficiently.
And so one day we get to a,

779
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,240
a really terrific climb,
uh,

780
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:58,580
during which there was a fair amount of
complaining.

781
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,380
Uh,
it was a brutal effort.

782
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,640
And when we emerged from the,
from the tree line,

783
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:07,850
we're on top of the highest peak in the
region.

784
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:10,290
We were exhilarated.
Uh,

785
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:14,210
the boys were exhilarated and my son
came over to him and he said,

786
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:16,700
Hey dad,
I said,

787
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:17,241
what?
He said,

788
00:52:17,241 --> 00:52:18,380
this is fantastic.
I said,

789
00:52:18,381 --> 00:52:19,610
I know,
and he said,

790
00:52:19,611 --> 00:52:23,720
I just want you to know I get it.
And I said,

791
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:25,670
what do you mean?
And he said,

792
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:31,420
this is by far the most fantastic thing
that we've ever done together.

793
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:38,710
So what did we learned by virtue of
taking a much more arduous,

794
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:45,820
a much more difficult journey than we
had taken up to that point in our

795
00:52:46,611 --> 00:52:48,800
scouting experience?
Um,

796
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,980
well,
he's now got an experience of the

797
00:52:51,981 --> 00:52:53,380
outdoors,
uh,

798
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:55,670
that's given him a permanent,
uh,

799
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:58,160
a permanent interests that he can pursue
in life.

800
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,890
Uh,
and of course there was also the element

801
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:05,060
of the experience that revolved around
the connection that he and I made

802
00:53:05,061 --> 00:53:07,700
together by virtue of having the
experience together.

803
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:12,530
So remember what Adler said in one
sense.

804
00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:15,800
Of course the great books are the most
difficult to read,

805
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,770
but they are in another sense the most
readable,

806
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:24,400
both for the less and the more competent
because they are the most instructive.

807
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:30,690
And that's the key word.
Obviously I do not mean says Adler most

808
00:53:30,691 --> 00:53:32,850
readable in the sense of with the least
effort,

809
00:53:32,851 --> 00:53:36,420
even for the expert.
I mean that these books reward every

810
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:39,570
degree of effort and ability to the
maximum.

811
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,580
So here's something else to think about
and it's something,

812
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:47,220
uh,
that Adler has to say and it goes beyond

813
00:53:47,221 --> 00:53:50,320
the five takeaways that I gave you for,
um,

814
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:53,490
things that you've,
things of value that you can derive from

815
00:53:53,491 --> 00:53:56,730
these books.
You're going to encounter a lot of

816
00:53:56,731 --> 00:53:57,540
things,
uh,

817
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:02,250
in your life that you need to know and
things that you need to learn about that

818
00:54:02,251 --> 00:54:05,580
aren't going to change you much at all.

819
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:08,280
Um,
you've learned many of these things

820
00:54:08,281 --> 00:54:10,380
already.
You learned how to drive a car.

821
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:13,500
Uh,
but that didn't change who you were as a

822
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:18,060
human being.
I'm suggesting to you now that you're

823
00:54:18,061 --> 00:54:21,720
going to be in the same position with
relation to these works.

824
00:54:21,721 --> 00:54:26,700
We've been talking about in this lecture
as the scout who's done the weekend

825
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:28,170
hiking,
uh,

826
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,200
taking the day trip,
uh,

827
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,450
maybe cook breakfast,
uh,

828
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:35,760
at the camporee and so forth.
Um,

829
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:40,740
remember how I said at the beginning
that aristotle said it's our nature to

830
00:54:40,741 --> 00:54:45,510
want to know things well,
just as it's our nature to work,

831
00:54:45,511 --> 00:54:48,150
to play,
to find a mate to live in society.

832
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:52,380
Um,
remember how I said that wisdom is

833
00:54:52,381 --> 00:54:55,590
something different from knowledge?
Well,

834
00:54:55,591 --> 00:54:59,550
here's my final thought for you.
And it's a deep paradox of learning.

835
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:05,690
You don't necessarily know what you are
looking for until you find it.

836
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:11,280
And it's the effort of finding it that
actually turns you into a different

837
00:55:11,281 --> 00:55:16,200
person than the one who set out on the
journey to begin with.

838
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:21,270
And that's why reading these great works
is very similar,

839
00:55:21,271 --> 00:55:25,140
in fact,
to the experience that my son had of a

840
00:55:25,141 --> 00:55:30,141
wilderness expedition after never having
attempted anything more than what you

841
00:55:30,181 --> 00:55:35,181
can get on the low lying ground.
So when you finally do achieve a,

842
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,110
a radical new perspective,
when it's not just a matter of taking in

843
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:44,250
bits of information and knowledge,
but it's a matter of changing how you

844
00:55:44,251 --> 00:55:48,300
put them together.
And also it's a matter of changing who

845
00:55:48,301 --> 00:55:51,060
you are as a result.
Um,

846
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:55,050
you will see a different value in these
things.

847
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,700
And for instance,
these books,

848
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:59,160
uh,
and you're also going to see yourself in

849
00:55:59,161 --> 00:56:04,161
a new light.
So I give you the only answer that I

850
00:56:05,951 --> 00:56:08,940
really can,
the best answer I know

851
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,240
why.
Read these books.

852
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,200
It's the same answer I gave my son.
You climb up into the mountains,

853
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:22,040
you make your most strenuous effort.
Uh,

854
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,860
you give it everything have.

855
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:26,050
And what's your reward?

856
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,360
It's the view.
It's the view.

857
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:32,400
Thank you very much.
