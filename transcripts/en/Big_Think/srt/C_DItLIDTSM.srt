1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,540
Yeah,

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,710
got very,
very little to do with the construction

3
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:20,420
of the welfare state economic model.
That was one element of the economic

4
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:24,410
model that was fundamentally flawed.
We are the fixed exchange rate policy

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,790
and that was untenable.
We try to defend the fixed exchange rate

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,130
with interest rates up to 500 percent.
That was ridiculous.

7
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,860
It was a failure,
but we were so

8
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,200
indoctrinated.
We had lived with a fixed exchange rate

9
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:48,201
regime all our lives since the early
thirties and we could not imagine that

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,430
was something wrong with the fundamental
element of our economic policy.

11
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,170
When that was abolished,
the economy took off and we've had much

12
00:00:57,171 --> 00:01:00,140
more flexible situation since then and
today.

13
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:04,280
It is one of the fundamental assets of
our economy that we are flexible enough

14
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,040
to set interest rates according to our
own needs,

15
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,500
high interest rates if you have
overheating innovation and can stimulate

16
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,230
by low interest rates when recession is
that threatening,

17
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,180
and I think that was one of the main
elements of the shocks that we

18
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:23,630
experienced in the late eighties.
We had a shock from the financial

19
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:27,320
markets and as you know,
financial markets destabilized.

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,870
They don't stabilize ID stabilize
economies,

21
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,070
the destabilized our economy,
we could not do anything about it

22
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:38,510
because we did not have in our
possession the interest rate weapon

23
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,760
because we had a fixed exchange rate
regime and I think that was a much more

24
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:44,970
important explanation.
