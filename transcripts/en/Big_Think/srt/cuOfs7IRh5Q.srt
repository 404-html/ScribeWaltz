1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,640
So there's a great book by Michael
Waltzer called what it means to be an

2
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:11,190
American,
and one of the things that he says is

3
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:14,370
that for centuries,
really from the time of the Greeks,

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,080
political philosophers believed that the
only way to have diversity in a society

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,360
was for it to be an empire or a
dictatorship.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,420
If you wanted a democracy,
it had to be homogenous.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,000
One ethnic group,
one racial group,

8
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:30,660
and especially one religion.
And then he ends that section and he

9
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:35,280
begins the next section with the line
until the United States of America.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,880
We are the first mass scale,
religiously diverse democracy,

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,720
and I think that's a remarkable thing.
And when a religiously diverse democracy

12
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:48,330
works well,
it's a sight to behold.

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,320
You have low levels of prejudice.
You have strong social cohesion,

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,250
you have high levels of social capital,
you have respect for different identity

15
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:58,470
communities.
You have the narrative of a diverse

16
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:02,040
society that binds that society with a
sense of unity.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,480
And a lot of what interfaith youth core
is about is helping America continue to

18
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:10,230
be a religiously diverse democracy that
we all ought to be proud of.

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,380
What strikes me most about the founding
fathers and a set of important figures

20
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,440
before the founding fathers,
people like Roger Williams and the

21
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:21,780
people who drafted the flushing
remonstrance,

22
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:26,781
that's 140 years before the founding
fathers was that this set of characters

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,540
imagined a religiously diverse democracy
and a big part of that is the separation

24
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:36,990
of church and state and as a part of
that of course is to protect the state

25
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:41,610
from the church and to protect religious
communities from undue interference by

26
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:46,611
the state and it is also significantly
about the welcoming of contributions

27
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:52,050
from diverse religious communities and
so it's not like the founding fathers

28
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:57,051
were principally very devout people,
but they recognize the importance of the

29
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:01,320
civic contributions of religious
communities and they certainly wanted

30
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,580
those communities to flourish.

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,320
Let me give you a couple of examples of
this.

32
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,290
So Benjamin Franklin,
when he lived in Philadelphia,

33
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,530
made proactive donations to the building
funds of every religious community that

34
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:16,050
he could find in Philadelphia.
Different communities of Christians,

35
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,840
a Jewish community,
and he built a hall,

36
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,130
said the pulpit of this hall will be
open to the preaching of anybody.

37
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,230
If the grand mufti of Constantinople
wants to send somebody preaching about

38
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,690
Islam,
this pulpit is here for his service,

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,420
right?
That's not just freedom of religion,

40
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,290
that's welcoming the contributions of
diverse religious communities.

41
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,530
George Washington,
when a Jewish leader in the late 18th

42
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:45,340
century says to him,
what's going to happen to,

43
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,710
to my community,
to us Jews now that we have a new

44
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,150
nation,
a constitution,

45
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:55,260
and you are the president.
And George Washington writes in a famous

46
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,680
document in American history called a
letter to the Hebrew congregation of

47
00:02:58,681 --> 00:02:59,620
Newport,
Rhode Island.

48
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,560
He writes,
this government will give to bigotry,

49
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,450
no sanction and to persecution.

50
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,650
No assistance made the children of the
stock of Abraham sit and safety under

51
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:12,100
their own vine and fig and let there be
none to make them afraid.

52
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,810
So there is this sense that these
different religious communities are

53
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:21,811
going to help make up the civil society
that is the United States of America.

54
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,380
I think about it as a,
as a potluck nation.

55
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,810
And of course,
that's a play on a,

56
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:30,600
on the term melting pot.
Uh,

57
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,690
and what I don't like about the melting
pot is obviously this notion that,

58
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,230
that you have to kind of melt away your
identity or your distinctiveness.

59
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,270
I think what makes America strong is not
that different communities melt away

60
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:46,390
their identities.
It's that they bring their identities to

61
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:49,690
the common table in the way we think
about a potluck,

62
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,150
right?
And a potluck is boring if everybody

63
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:54,130
brings wonder.
Bread and peanut butter.

64
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,430
A potluck is wonderful and nutritious
and festive when people bring the

65
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:03,280
various dishes that are distinctive to
their identity.

66
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,350
That's how I think about interfaith.
America is a variety of communities.

67
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:10,960
A variety of orientations around
religion,

68
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,450
as I said,
from atheist to Zoroastrians,

69
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,770
are contributing the best of who they
are for the comments.

70
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,320
If different communities don't
contribute,

71
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,910
the nation doesn't feast.
