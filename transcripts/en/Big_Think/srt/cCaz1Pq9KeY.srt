1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,930
It's
fairly neat.

2
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,190
It's both the head of state and the head
of government.

3
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:14,180
And that's pretty rare.

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,400
I mean,
the head of the government,

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,890
the head,
the head of government,

6
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:21,891
we expect to fulfill a litany of duties
and we get in there and do a,

7
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:23,791
b,
c,

8
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:24,540
d,
e,

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,620
whatever.
The,

10
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:28,170
how to stay is special.
The head of state is,

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,280
is,
is ideally a reflection of our better

12
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:34,740
selves.
A heightened version of the common man

13
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:38,280
or a woman.
This person that kind of embodies all

14
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:41,370
that America should be.
And you know,

15
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,380
to George Bush,
to his credit,

16
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:48,381
he doesn't stint on,
on who he is.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,160
I mean,
he puts it out there to be embraced or

18
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:54,510
rejected.
And,

19
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:55,860
um,
um,

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,650
and that's what's so weird is that,
that the Bush administration,

21
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:03,850
this is a side point,
but

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,050
okay.

23
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,110
The Bush administration is visionary.
I mean,

24
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:13,760
no one can ever claim that there was
anything incremental about this

25
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:15,770
administration.
It was,

26
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,730
it's been a visionary administration
with terrible eyesight.
