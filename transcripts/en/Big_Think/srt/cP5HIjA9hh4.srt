1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,190
And some of you may be wondering whether
you're actually in a relationship with a

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:09,000
psychopath or whether the youth,
you might've fallen for a psychopath in

3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,220
the past.
And if you are in a relationship with a

4
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:13,830
psychopath,
a what you can do about that.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,340
Now,
uh,

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,260
psychopaths do have certain
characteristics.

7
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:22,260
Certain tells a,
to use a poker analogy,

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,740
a that they display in relationships.
Um,

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,650
they tend to play on our pity a lot.
Okay?

10
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:33,420
So they tend to excuse they're
misdemeanors and bad behaviors,

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,850
um,
through something that would be on their

12
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:38,490
control.
They couldn't help doing it because you

13
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:40,530
know,
something had happened and you know,

14
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:45,150
there's always an excuse for it.
And all those psychopaths don't feel

15
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:48,630
emotions like us.
They are masters at pushing those

16
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:52,010
emotional hot buttons that elicit
emotions in,

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,860
in,
in others,

18
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:53,890
in us.
Uh,

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,050
sympathy being one of the major,
major motivators.

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,260
Okay.
A psychopath also tend to be very

21
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,310
narcissistic.
Um,

22
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,150
they tend to think that the world
centers around them.

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,090
They're not really attuned to your
feelings.

24
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:11,430
They don't really care about your
feelings.

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,271
Uh,
really,

26
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:13,900
ultimately the world,
uh,

27
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,000
surrounds a,
surrounds them a solid psychopathic,

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,320
also very charming.
They're very manipulative,

29
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,500
especially when they're in a crowd,
especially when they're in company.

30
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,230
Uh,
but behind the scenes when they're alone

31
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:26,460
with you,
they can be very,

32
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,850
very controlling sometimes,
but not always aggressive,

33
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,910
but psychologically controlling as well.
Okay.

34
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,960
So if you're worried about the fact,
if you're worried that your,

35
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:37,531
uh,
you know,

36
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,140
in,
in a relationship with a psychopath,

37
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,140
what can you do about that?
What might be some certain things to,

38
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:44,670
to look out for?
Well,

39
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:48,210
first of all,
the absolute first thing to do is,

40
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,780
uh,
to not go on face value,

41
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:54,240
to not fall for the smokescreen.

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,021
Okay?
Uh,

43
00:01:55,021 --> 00:02:00,021
number one rule of thumb is to don't
judge a person on what they say,

44
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,320
but judge a person on what they do.
Okay?

45
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:08,730
So that's the very first thing.
Look at the evidence of their behavior

46
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,200
and try to judge it objectively rather
than subjectively.

47
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:14,820
Not An easy thing to do.
I admit.

48
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:16,230
If you're in a relationship with
someone.

49
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,990
Secondly,
if you suspect that your partner is a

50
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:22,050
psychopath,
why don't you get a second opinion from

51
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:24,870
one of your friends?
Why don't you confide in your friends?

52
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:27,600
I think my partner is a psychopath or I
think these,

53
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:30,960
are there certain characteristics?
Give me an honest opinion.

54
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,450
What do you really think about my
partner?

55
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,040
Okay.
And a second opinion.

56
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,170
Two heads are often better than one in
this kind of case.

57
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,390
Thirdly,
numb.

58
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:44,391
A golden rule is don't cover for them if
they start getting into serious trouble

59
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:49,710
and they want you to somehow front up
for them or be an alibi or somehow make

60
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,300
excuses or whatever,
whatever.

61
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,770
Don't get tangled up into covering up
for them because as soon as that starts

62
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:57,630
happening,
it's called the foot in the door

63
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:58,500
technique.
A very,

64
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:02,440
very common persuasive technique.
Once you've done something for someone,

65
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,200
you're more likely to do other followup
things for them.

66
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:06,610
And before you know it,
your in,

67
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,080
up to your neck.
Okay.

68
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:10,690
And the fourth thing I would say is buy
my book,

69
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,520
uh,
because all the,

70
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:14,530
uh,
all the signs and all the tricks of the

71
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:15,790
trainer in there.
Uh,

72
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:19,150
and fore warned is definitely forearm
when you're dealing with sign up.
