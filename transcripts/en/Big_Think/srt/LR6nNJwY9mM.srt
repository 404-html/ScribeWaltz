1
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,410
Well,
the violin is,

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,620
for me,
it's one of my voices.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,900
Um,
it's one of the voices that express my

4
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:14,220
thoughts,
my feelings,

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,140
my understandings of different things in
different matters.

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,530
Um,
it tries to communicate

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,880
different messages,
different ideas.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,530
Um,
different discoveries,

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,970
um,
different beliefs,

10
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,280
um,
different interpretations.

11
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:34,170
Um,
many different things.

12
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:38,790
Um,
violence is really for me to voice.

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,850
My violin was made in 1734.
It's made by granaries still jaisal.

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,760
I'm one of the two.
I'm most notable acres for the

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,410
instrument of the violin.
Um,

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,210
and I've had it for a little over 10
years now.

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,640
Um,
it's Italian,

18
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:07,641
it's made like a starter as violent or
other ordinary as violence meeting

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Cremona in Italy and um,
it's difficult to say,

20
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:20,091
you know,
what's the violin and what's me because

21
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:24,630
it's the combination that really makes
it very unique.

22
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,810
Um,
another player playing the exact same

23
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,200
violin,
um,

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,810
would sound very differently.

25
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,110
Um,
I might play another instrument.

26
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,790
I'm not the one that I have,
but might be something else and I would

27
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:43,620
still sound like me also,
but it's really a combination.

28
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:46,920
And also,
I do think that the violent is a living

29
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:48,360
being.
Um,

30
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,590
first of all,
it's extremely sensitive to humidity and

31
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:56,700
to heat temperature changes.
Um,

32
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,010
it's very,
very capricious.

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,340
It's very,
I'm temperamental.

34
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,380
Um,
it's,

35
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,030
it gets grouchy.
It's,

36
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,880
you know,
I'm meant to a good mood.

37
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,290
Takes regular maintenance.
That's like going to violin doctor.

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,000
Um,
but I actually love this instrument and

39
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:21,720
it just feels,
it just feels like this is the partner

40
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,570
that I want.
Um,

41
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,870
and I'm very,
very grateful for having access to such

42
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:29,040
a great instrument.
It is.

43
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,860
It doesn't matter food place on it.
It is a great instrument,

44
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,190
but it's something about this particular
great instrument that I'm just so I'm

45
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,200
attracted to.
And I think it's a lot to do with

46
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,510
chemistry as well.
It's not something you know,

47
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:43,920
that,
um,

48
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,150
one can say as well,
if you put this element into this

49
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:50,970
violent,
then this person's going to like it

50
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:55,971
better is I think just a combination of
known and unknown things that make it

51
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:58,140
very,
very special.

52
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,680
I consider it a partner.
I don't think of it as an extension of

53
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:08,650
myself and people like to think that,
um,

54
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,251
you know,
well,

55
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:12,430
a violin could be like a part of your
body or a part of you.

56
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,380
I think it's a wonderful partner.
Um,

57
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,000
I do give it that little distance that
it's something that lives with that

58
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:19,540
objective.
