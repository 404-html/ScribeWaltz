1
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,210
I think the big difference between Iraq
and Vietnam,

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,610
I said after we lost and withdrew from
Vietnam,

3
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:21,760
they didn't want to follow us home.
I think it's very clear.

4
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:25,480
If you read bin Ladin Sarkar ways are
we're hearing these other people,

5
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,160
they want to follow us home.
They view Iraq as a stepping stone to

6
00:00:30,161 --> 00:00:33,310
America,
so the dimensions of the conflict have

7
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:37,720
changed dramatically.
It's eerie in a way.

8
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:41,320
Some of the comparisons to the early
stages of the Vietnam War and the

9
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:44,230
strategy that was used and the Rumsfeld
strategy,

10
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,290
there were both failed strategies and
they were very similar and so the on the

11
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:53,500
ground that's a little bit eerie.
It was called search and destroy and

12
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:55,540
Vietnam.
They went out and killed bad guys and

13
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:59,230
came back to base.
That was what Rumsfeld was strategy was

14
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:04,231
doing before then we got General Abrams
says the head of the military in Vietnam

15
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:10,561
and they went out and they went out and
they secured areas and they stayed and

16
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:13,900
they allowed the normal life to begin.

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,490
That's the same thing that ha that we
know strategy in Vietnam under general,

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,600
in Iraq under General Patraeus.
We'd go out and we secure an area and we

19
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:28,000
patrol all the time with Iraqi military
and we don't leave.

20
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,590
It caused an upsurge in casualties.
They are now coming way back down

21
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:38,130
because the strategy is succeeding.
That happened with General Abrams to in

22
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,940
the Vietnam War that people ran out of
patience and demanded that we do nothing

23
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:44,800
else,
even though our troops had already

24
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:48,880
withdrawn from the in this war.
The question is,

25
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:52,990
will it get Baghdad clock and the
Washington Clark be the same and that's

26
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:56,590
not clear to me.
Although we have beat back the Democrats

27
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:59,580
effort to set a date for withdrawal is
shorter time ago.

28
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:02,410
It was last week.
I think the other part though that is

29
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:06,490
most heartening to me use America is
very divided about this war,

30
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,630
but none of us are divided in our
support of the men and women who are

31
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:14,950
serving in uniform and unfortunately in
the Vietnam war,

32
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,570
it wasn't like that.
So I'm proud not only of these young men

33
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:22,450
and women who are serving because of the
best of America,

34
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,370
but I'm proud of America in that we are
supporting these young men and women.

35
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,330
No matter how we feel about the war and
whether it's right or wrong.

36
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,270
I think it's.
It's something that's very,

37
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:37,660
very important and one that I can't tell
you how much

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,500
appreciate it.
