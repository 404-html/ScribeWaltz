1
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,930
So one of the great things about a
civilization is that

2
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,090
there's a whole bunch of different
people.

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,830
All the different people have different,
are curious about different things and

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,520
somehow if they all follow their own
curiosity in some way,

5
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,390
great stuff happens.
That's sort of what's happened so far.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,990
I mean,
if you're in a civilization where you're

7
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:37,991
able to support people doing that,
then uh,

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,290
the civilization feels you feel happier
to be in it.

9
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,740
I mean,
when I read about something that,

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,440
whether it's art or biology or
sociology,

11
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:52,430
if I read about something interesting
and I realize that some humans actually

12
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:54,730
spent their whole life doing that and
it's,

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,640
and that we supported them doing it,
I f I feel like that's the,

14
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,220
the,
the pinnacle of civilization that's the

15
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:02,930
best.
So I think,

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,480
you know,
one of the reasons we fund these

17
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,380
experiments,
um,

18
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,610
is because we want to live in a world
where people find stuff out.

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,180
Imagine if you funded nothing in science
and you never found anything out.

20
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,940
How depressing would that be?
I don't know actually.

21
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:27,020
How depressing would that be that that
would be pretty depressing.

22
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:30,440
Or imagine a world in which nobody could
write books or,

23
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,860
yeah,
I think the reason to fund things,

24
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:34,461
and you can,
of course,

25
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,460
you can't argue that any stupid thing
you should fund,

26
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,260
but if there's a whole lot of people who
are interested in doing something and it

27
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:44,480
makes sense and they've worked on it for
years,

28
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,060
it's reasonable to fund it.
I think if you can,

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,030
I mean,
there's some people who believe that,

30
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:51,590
you know,
you should only fund things that make

31
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:54,350
people's lives longer,
but that seems ridiculous.

32
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:59,060
How about making people's lives better?
How about people making people happier

33
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,230
to be alive because they can read cool
stuff in the New York Times or whatever,

34
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,110
wherever in science.
So this,

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,580
so people are somehow moralistic about
the length of people's lives rather than

36
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:13,910
the quality of life or the rather than
the standard of living.

37
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,010
So I think by me doing particle physics,
it raises everybody's standard of

38
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:20,480
living.
That's a,

39
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:21,940
okay

40
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,710
boy,
maybe I shouldn't be quoted that way,

41
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,540
I think.
I think I do that.
