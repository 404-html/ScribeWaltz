Hey Chris,
it's a really cool question about

2
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:15,720
different types of rocket engines and
whether there might be a rocket engine

3
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:17,910
coming in the future that uses very
little energy.

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,660
One of the big challenges of getting
anything into space right now is you

5
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:23,580
need to get it up out of the earth's
gravity.

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,150
And really the only way we had to do
that is with fairly traditional rockets.

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,000
They use either solid rocket fuel or
liquid rocket fuel,

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,360
but it takes a huge amount of energy to
get off the surface of the earth.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,980
Right now we don't really have any
better way to get things off the surface

10
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:41,220
of the earth,
but things change once you get up into

11
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:43,650
space.
And what are the things that I'm really

12
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:45,960
excited about is something called an ion
drive,

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,200
and NASA uses these right now and an eye
on drive generates a tiny little bit of

14
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:52,290
thrust.

15
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,060
I mean,
it's almost similar to just taking your

16
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:57,450
hand and blowing on it.
It's about that much thrust,

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,760
but you can turn an eye on drive on and
you can leave it on for years.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,070
So even though it's a tiny little bit of
thrust,

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,240
some of the fastest spacecraft at NASA
now operates use ion drives.

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,700
One of my favorite missions is the dawn
mission,

21
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,480
which is actually serving the larger
asteroids in the asteroid belt and went

22
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:19,380
out to the asteroid Vesta and vestas is
about 300 miles across.

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,750
It.
Took wonderful pictures of Vesta and

24
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:24,900
then it went onto the asteroid ceres,
which is actually the largest of the

25
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:27,690
asteroids.
It's actually close to 700 miles across.

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,640
And the images it returned if series
were absolutely amazing and it was able

27
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:36,660
to go from one asteroid to another
because it had this ion drive that it

28
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:37,980
could leave on for years.

29
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,840
And even though the thrust is tiny,
keep that thrust going day after day,

30
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,730
month after month,
year after year,

31
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,760
you can get up to many,
many tens of thousands of miles an hour.

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,470
So the way an eye on drive works is it
basically can even use just electricity.

33
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,330
It creates ions by actually ripping
apart molecules into charged particles

34
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,090
and then accelerating them out the back
of the spacecraft.

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,290
And really all you need is electricity.
You can even run this on solar panels if

36
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,330
you want.
So you could actually have an entire

37
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:10,890
rocket engine up in space that is
powered simply by solar energy and

38
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:13,680
accelerating ions out the end of the
spacecraft.

39
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,570
The problem is we don't know how to use
an ion engine to actually launch

40
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,640
something into space.
For that,

41
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,730
you need a lot of thrust.
You need to actually get out of the

42
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:28,230
strong gravity well of the earth.
So right now we sort of have these dual

43
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,710
strategies for rocket engines.
One that gets you up off the earth,

44
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:34,710
and those are pretty traditional.
But then once you get into space,

45
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,200
turn on your ion drive,
leave it on,

46
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,830
get yourself going 30,000 miles an hour,
a little bit at a time,

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,690
and you never need to turn it off.

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,360
Yeah.
