1
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,570
I was raised in western Massachusetts,
I am the child of two southerners and my

2
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:21,191
brother is also southern and my family
is southern way back before the

3
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:25,100
mayflower.
So I was the only Yankee in the family

4
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:27,890
for all generations.
And it,

5
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:30,530
um,
it definitely shaped me and my taste.

6
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:35,531
I was the only little Yankee boy who
liked boiled peanuts and puts a salted

7
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:39,530
peanuts in his coke and I'm liked grits
for breakfast.

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,560
Okay.

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,880
Well,
southerners I think have,

10
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:51,190
um,
a number of traditions,

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,400
one of which is a storytelling.
So,

12
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:58,990
um,
my southern relations when we get

13
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,880
together,
I mean it's just one story after

14
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:01,840
another,
after another,

15
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:06,290
after another Thanksgiving when I go
down to visit my uncle Bob and aunt

16
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:11,291
render and all the cousins are there.
My stomach will hurt for days afterward

17
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:15,430
because it's just so funny and they're
all great storytellers and that's kind

18
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:19,450
of how a family knowledge is passed on
from generation to generation is through

19
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:22,270
stories.
Um,

20
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,081
you know,
I mean,

21
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:25,480
it's a cliche,
but,

22
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,170
um,
there's a certain level of dysfunction I

23
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:34,171
suppose that goes along with being part
of a southern family secrets.

24
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,050
And,
and,

25
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:42,050
and all these entanglements
and there's a,

26
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:46,300
uh,
there's a sort of gentility a courtesy.

27
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,000
I mean,
I was very polite as a child.

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,910
I'm very well mannered as a child and
um,

29
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,450
that's something else that you find

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,810
probably it all started with the,
with the astors,

31
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,260
you know,
in the vanderbilts in New York City in

32
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,900
the gilded age when society was
constructed of layers upon layers upon

33
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,360
layers of etiquette.
I mean,

34
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:20,070
you,
you didn't call somebody on the phone or

35
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:22,500
you didn't text them and say,
let's go grab lunch.

36
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,330
You would have your,
Your Person Send Your handwritten note

37
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,470
over by carriage to your acquaintances
or your friend's house.

38
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,230
And they would receive the note and
respond in kind.

39
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:35,880
And they were just very,
um,

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
many layers to society and how we
behaved and how we reacted

41
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:46,341
appropriately.
Now because New York is an,

42
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,660
always has been sort of the,
uh,

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,650
the design geist from which,
you know,

44
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,890
everything radiates out.
This is sort of the taste center and the

45
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,580
design center of America.
Um,

46
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,660
and certainly was back then,
I think a lot of people emulated a,

47
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:07,710
that stratified sort of concept of
society and um,

48
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,490
Chicago certainly did,
you know,

49
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:13,480
the big families began behaving as New
Yorkers did and then as,

50
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,340
as society spread west and happened in
the west coast as well and down south.

51
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,050
And it's interesting because,
um,

52
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,060
these,
these manners,

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,430
you know,
a lot of them became of course outdated

54
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,280
over time.
Life became more casual,

55
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,460
you know,
casual Friday took over.

56
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,900
But in the south,
what you find is that these,

57
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,590
um,
these manners still remain.

58
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,060
Um,
last Thanksgiving I was driving down a

59
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:47,770
dirt road in Alabama.
Is that a red clay road?

60
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:52,000
Very Narrow d dog,
Alabama,

61
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,770
you know,
where there are alligators in the

62
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:57,730
backyard and this big pickup truck,
like in Ford,

63
00:03:57,731 --> 00:03:59,530
f three,
five was approaching me.

64
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,700
And um,
so it was me and my boyfriend and our

65
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,040
two French bulldogs.
And I'm thinking,

66
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,410
okay,
this is the part where the good old boy

67
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:11,620
pulls the fags over,
shoots him and takes the dogs.

68
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,580
And so as this truck gets closer and
closer,

69
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:16,750
it's got the big headlights,
you know,

70
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:20,860
on the top,
I see the driver is wearing camouflage,

71
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,560
including a camouflage hat.
So I'm thinking,

72
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:24,394
well,
this is it.

73
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,610
We're going to die.
And just as we passed the trucker goes

74
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:30,670
like this
and moves on.

75
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,740
And I realized at that moment it was an
epiphany and I realized the last

76
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,760
gentleman,
these are the last true gentlemen,

77
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,950
are the southern good old boys because
their mamas taught them to behave,

78
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,360
you know?
Yes ma'am.

79
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,310
Thank you ma'am.
No Sir.

80
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,690
Thank you sir.
And that's pretty much how it is in the

81
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,420
shelf.
And that's why I love the south.

82
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,710
I love,
I love this APP.

83
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,140
I don't think I've inherited the um,
you know,

84
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,150
the gothic literary sensibility sort of
almost dated to Eudora welty and

85
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,210
flannery o'connor.
It's a,

86
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:16,540
it's a south that doesn't quite exist as
it did.

87
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,760
Certainly there are pockets,
um,

88
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,320
but because I didn't live in the south,
I didn't experience,

89
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:25,600
you know,
the Spanish moss hanging off the trees

90
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,840
and the sort of sweltering day days in
that sort of drowsy,

91
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,200
you know.
And the sort of sweet tea and um,

92
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,250
I have a deep appreciation for it.
I mean,

93
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:42,440
one of my favorite authors is um,
Carson mccullers and I think I'm,

94
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,640
the member of the wedding is just one of
the most perfect books ever written.

95
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,260
Um,
and it really for me,

96
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:49,960
captures that flavor.
I don't know if you would call it a

97
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:54,070
gothic southern novel,
but it certainly captures that dee dee

98
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,580
just sort of almost the central south
and melancholy quality.

99
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,510
So I myself don't think of myself as a
southern writer,

100
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:06,270
although there are certain things about
me that are definitely a bitter

101
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,920
definitely southern that are there as a
result of,

102
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:10,491
um,
you know,

103
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:12,560
having southern parents and having
southern relatives.
