1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,540
A large percentage of what people will
contribute to something is sometimes

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,570
it's as much a donation in support of a
relationship as it is a donation in

3
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:16,581
support of a cause.
What we wanted to be sure to do was make

4
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:21,711
sure that for the motivated person who's
got a target and a goal that that what

5
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:28,191
we were engineering was an incredible
toolbox for them to use all of our best

6
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:33,720
ideas that we've ever had and even to
source from other people by surfing

7
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:37,230
around in the site,
effective ways of taking their

8
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:39,750
motivation and their energy and you
know,

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,960
leveraging it into really good
productivity in terms of their personal

10
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:47,760
fundraising.
So on the one hand you want to supply

11
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:52,140
the motivated person with everything
they need to do a really good job.

12
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,700
The next ring out is people who might
not have a specific connection.

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,790
So for organizations,
we think one of the things that's really

14
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,080
potent is the idea of in some ways doing
what Obama did,

15
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:09,081
which is take people who are already
donors to you and turn them into small

16
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,090
fundraisers for you.
You know,

17
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:14,250
I mean,
if a person is capable of giving 50

18
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:17,790
bucks themselves,
but it's really easy for them to reach

19
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,670
out to their family and friends and just
on the strength of personal

20
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:22,290
relationships,
say,

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,580
could I get,
um,

22
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,960
you know,
10 more people to donate 50 bucks,

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,730
then they've just multiplied their own
capacity by 10 times.

24
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,790
Anyone who was involved in fundraising
will tell you that that kind of

25
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:39,210
multiplying effect,
it has huge ramifications.
