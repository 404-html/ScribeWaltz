1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:00,903
Yeah,

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,460
yes,
it was there that I

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,680
decided
that even if I wasn't going to die,

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,900
and obviously I didn't.
I'm not afraid of death.

5
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,270
The is part of life.
Most people I have met a particularly.

6
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:37,951
Americans
just are so afraid of death.

7
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,640
Um,
I don't look forward to it at 85.

8
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:47,120
I know it's just a few years away,
but I don't fear it.

9
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,430
I believe in the afterlife,
I believe,

10
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,670
and a reward and punishment and I hope
I'll be rewarded.

11
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,790
I think some of all of that comes from
having served in

12
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,330
war.
Um,

13
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,390
and I think I'm serving in a war and
seeing people die,

14
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,310
um,
also impacts on how you think about

15
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:22,120
other wars.
So I believe,

16
00:01:22,121 --> 00:01:25,840
uh,
that this country has to be defended and

17
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,460
air are just wars.
And certainly World War Two was a such a

18
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:32,820
just war,
uh,

19
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:38,010
but that the Vietnam War was not.
And I thought that we shouldn't be in

20
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:42,190
it.
And I was marching the various

21
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:45,340
demonstrations against it.
Uh,

22
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,500
I,
uh,

23
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:54,510
believed it was wrong and ultimately I'm
a huge majority of the people of this

24
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:57,490
country thought it was wrong.
And,

25
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,670
uh,
they stopped it with their marches.

26
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,290
Well,
I think like most soldiers at the time,

27
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,240
I served in the European theater of
operations and served into campaigns,

28
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,220
one for northern France,
the other for the Rhineland and I fought

29
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,190
in Holland,
Belgium,

30
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,520
Germany.
Um,

31
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,830
I saw people killed.
I was very frightened and often thought

32
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:33,740
I would
probably die,

33
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,510
uh,
in Europe on the battlefield somewhere,

34
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,740
but I didn't.
And uh,

35
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,420
I came out alive.
I was discharged as a sergeant.

36
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,490
Uh,
um,

37
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,950
I think that being in a war and has an
effect on your character

38
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,610
outlook on life.
And,

39
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:03,760
uh,
I don't recommend it,

40
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,490
certainly other ways to build character.
Um,

41
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,730
but it's part of who you are,
what you are.
