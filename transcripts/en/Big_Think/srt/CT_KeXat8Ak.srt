1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,220
Immediately I
went to a day school or prep school in

2
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:13,620
Jeddah,
the only one to an international modern

3
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:16,410
standard in the kingdom at the time.
And he was,

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,250
uh,
essentially recruited into an Islamic

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,280
group by a charismatic Syrian Gym
teacher at his prep school who mentored

6
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:29,010
him and taught him and essentially
indoctrinated him into the Muslim

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,080
Brotherhood.
And that was the beginning of a series

8
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:36,081
of relationships with mentors,
essentially professional mentors that

9
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:40,120
seemed also to have a sort of personal
role in his life of dilemmas.

10
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,730
Uh,
who was a collaborator and,

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,740
and Co founder of,
of,

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,200
um,
the precursor organization to al Qaeda

13
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:52,960
during the anti-soviet war.
Ayman Elza Walker,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,380
relater,
the Egyptian who co founded,

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,440
um,
al Qaeda with him though,

16
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,320
is while he was his deputy,
he was also in a,

17
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,860
in a sort of biographical sense,
also a mentor and a and a,

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,770
uh,
a kind of a patron of Osama.

19
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,840
The overall narrative is,
um,

20
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,710
you know,
maybe not too surprising,

21
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:18,000
but worth just sketching,
which is he's a shy,

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,060
a privileged,
wealthy young man who is recruited into

23
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,420
International Islamic radicalism and his
mentor and doted on primarily at first

24
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:35,481
because of his money and his older,
more ambitious mentors want access to

25
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:37,680
what he has,
not only his own deep pockets,

26
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,770
but also the fundraising world that he
can open up in Saudi Arabia,

27
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,580
but gradually as he,
as he ages and as he matures,

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,240
he either overthrows his mentors,
are slowly separates from them and all

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,960
and develops his own ambition and his
own very full egotistical sense of his

30
00:01:56,131 --> 00:02:00,570
own capabilities.
And I don't think in the end he is a

31
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,800
prisoner of his mentors.
I think in instead he,

32
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:07,680
he sort of grows beyond them.
By and large,

33
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,633
evens watery,

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,440
always has often been a creature of
media and has yearned to be heard.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And this particularly as he came into
his own and decided that he had a role

36
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:31,780
to play in this narrative that he
imagined he had been called into by God

37
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:33,520
and,
and where he was drawn.

38
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:38,521
Also for reasons of his own ambition,
he he loved to.

39
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,950
He had an intuition about a brand
building and about media that was really

40
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:51,340
one of his core talents and one of his
core insights and a source of much of

41
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:54,310
his innovation and achievement and after
nine slash 11,

42
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,760
he had to repress some of those
instincts because it was too risky to go

43
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:04,240
on television as often as he might like.
You can see him when he comes forward.

44
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:07,090
Even after periods of silence,
he comes forward with a video where he

45
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:11,890
comes forward with an audio tape and if
you read through the text of everything

46
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:15,670
he's been saying since nine slash 11
when he does surface to talk or you look

47
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:18,940
at those videotapes,
you have the impression of someone who's

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,370
in hiding but has access to a lot of
media.

49
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,960
He's reading.
He's clearly reading books.

50
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,420
He's clearly as access to the news,
whether it's on the internet or on

51
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:29,140
satellite television and he's and you
all sometimes you always had the sense

52
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:31,180
that he's like watching President Bush
on television,

53
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:32,830
make a speech,
and he just gets.

54
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:33,890
He gets.
He,

55
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,980
I gotta I gotTa talk,
I gotta say something,

56
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,640
bring my media guy,
and then he goes and he makes a speech

57
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:42,700
and he's almost talking back to the,
to the global media.

58
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:46,360
So I do think is there is clearly an
impulse that he has,

59
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,233
um,
uh,

60
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,960
to be heard.
That's how he's always conceived as role

61
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:53,740
as a vanguard,
someone who stimulates a and encourages

62
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:57,820
others not as someone who needs to
control a political organization or be

63
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,700
the boss,
but someone who inspires you.

64
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,890
It sort of confirms

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,400
the little bits of information that were
available about his family's

66
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:13,960
circumstances.
In this period of exile,

67
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,780
the Sama has had at least four or five
wives.

68
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,210
The wives that are known are,
have all returned to their home

69
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:29,211
countries.
I believe almost all of his daughters,

70
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:31,560
if not all of his daughters,
have also returned home.

71
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,370
He has perhaps a dozen or more sons and
of those,

72
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,240
some have returned home and some were
believed like Hamza to be an exile with

73
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:45,450
him if perhaps living with him,
perhaps living near him.

74
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,780
There was an exchange between Osama and
his son,

75
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:53,781
Hamza on the,
on Jihadi websites in late 2001 where a

76
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:58,890
Sama essentially wrote a letter to Hamza
in the form of a last will and

77
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:02,250
testament.
And so Hamza,

78
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,090
along with a couple of other sons,
have clearly been with them.

79
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:11,010
They've appeared in videos before as
young jihadi is even at ages nine and 10

80
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,360
by now,
Hamza,

81
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:15,060
I guess I don't know what the video
shows today,

82
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:17,520
buddy.
I would guess he's about 16 or 17.

83
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,290
Um,
and uh,

84
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,310
so he would have been one of the three
or four that you would have guessed was

85
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,170
roughly wherever Osama's hiding along
the Pak Afghan frontier that Hamza is

86
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:30,900
out there too,
probably a lot.

87
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:33,180
And then Mohammed and a couple others
are out there as well.

88
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,080
I think he's a long time

89
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,230
Afghan,
Pakistan border.

90
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,780
Um,
and you know,

91
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,850
sometimes to try to play a,
sort of,

92
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,830
have this parlor game you could play
with people who watch al Qaeda or the

93
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,550
pay attention to search for bin Ladin.
Suppose someone walks into the room

94
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:55,420
right now and says,
oh,

95
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,130
som has been captured,
or someone just hit them with a

96
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:00,390
Predator,
a gay,

97
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,190
you say,
okay,

98
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,660
interesting.
Don't tell me where.

99
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,000
Put a map up on the wall,
take a pin,

100
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,510
put the pin in the map and you know,
10 people closest to the whole winds,

101
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:10,220
you know,
where,

102
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,440
who can come closest to where he
actually was.

103
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,250
And so where would you put your pin?
And I would probably put it

104
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,460
in northwest zero.
Stand around Mirin shot along the

105
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:24,890
border.
There's a area they're controlled by the

106
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:27,320
[inaudible] clan that he has long roots
in.

107
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,740
There are some risks to him if he stays
in that area.

108
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:33,590
And so maybe it's a little too busy and
a little too trafficked.

109
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,750
An alternative place where,
uh,

110
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:39,530
some other smart people who know them in
intelligence,

111
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,340
they tend to put their pins just a
little bit north of that in Bodger,

112
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,210
but it's basically a general area,
um,

113
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,600
around the,
the federally administrated tribal

114
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:54,110
areas.
Probably more north than south would be

115
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:54,944
my best stuff

116
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,050
very
much

117
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,700
at a couple of levels.
It samas ideology is not very fully

118
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:10,630
formed.
I don't think his analysis or his

119
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:14,950
ideology or his political program are by
any means.

120
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:19,720
His strengths is he has talents,
but ultimately,

121
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,000
um,
this sense of ideology and,

122
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,420
and strategy is,
is not one of them.

123
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:25,720
And,
and,

124
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,390
and,
and ultimately I think al Qaeda will be

125
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:31,240
defeated by the self limiting nature of
his ideology.

126
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:33,640
However,
to the extent that he has ideology,

127
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:37,270
it has sort of two levels.
One is a political sort of terra firma

128
00:07:37,271 --> 00:07:41,660
here and now set of grievances in which
he's trying to give voice to a,

129
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,710
an eclectic array of legitimate
grievances in the Islamic world.

130
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:51,190
And on the other hand,
he has a millenarian view of himself as

131
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,110
leading a preordained war called by God
that will end at the end of time and at

132
00:07:56,111 --> 00:07:59,440
both levels the metaphor of a war.

133
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,910
And the fact of war are central to his
claim on his followers.

134
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:04,840
So,
uh,

135
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,460
when the Bush administration after nine
slash 11 announces a war against him and

136
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:14,050
frames a global war in which he is the
adversary,

137
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,220
it provides exactly the narrative that
he's been.

138
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,210
It reinforces and elevates and
accentuates the narrative that he's been

139
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:27,211
developing and certainly he would
embrace and has embraced the sort of

140
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:34,651
equivalency that the war narrative
provides between himself and say George

141
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:39,070
W dot Bush on the one hand,
the president of the hyper power of the

142
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:41,590
post early post Cold War period.
And on the other hand,

143
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,550
Osama bin Ladin leading the righteous
forces of Islam against the oppression,

144
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,520
uh,
carried out by that hyper power.

145
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:52,690
And so the Bush administration sort of
fairly quickly realized,

146
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:57,691
especially after they turned their
attention from pursuing him and toward

147
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:01,650
invading Iraq,
that maybe it wasn't a good idea to call

148
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:03,440
attention to his.
So they,

149
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:05,310
they,
they've gone through this kind of

150
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,020
bipolar or sort of swings in their,
in their attitude towards the psalm as

151
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:13,800
an adversary trying to not elevate and
by not talking about him,

152
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,560
uh,
but then that only emphasizes the

153
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:18,210
impunity that he seems to enjoy it.

154
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,853
It's,

155
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:30,070
it's an organization with a particular
leader and deputy leader and a bunch of

156
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:33,770
committees and a headquarters sort of.
And some,

157
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:36,200
you know,
it is a continuous organization that was

158
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:40,370
founded at meetings in 1988,
has had the same bureaucracy and the

159
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,230
same leader and deputy leader for 20
years.

160
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:44,120
So there is an organization,
it's called Al Qaeda,

161
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:47,420
has a boss and it has committees that do
finance and media and military.

162
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,790
It's more than that though.
It's also a movement that inspires

163
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,860
followers who are disconnected from
leaders.

164
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,390
It's also a network of likeminded
organizations and it's also a brand that

165
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,990
attempts to attract other organizations
and adherence,

166
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:08,090
whether in groups or as individuals.
So Al Qaeda is I think properly

167
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:11,720
understood a synthesis of these
characteristics today.

168
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,760
Al Qaeda,
the organization is resilient militarily

169
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:21,140
in the sense that they continue to be
able to run medium sized attacks into

170
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:25,430
Europe.
They are struggling politically.

171
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,650
I think they are strategically,
uh,

172
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,310
in,
in a corner that they're not likely to

173
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:34,430
get out of.
I'm very easily.

174
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,120
But the organization a is still a factor
in the security threats faced by not

175
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:49,860
only the United States but also Britain
and Germany and Denmark.

176
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,320
I tend to be the,
I've been my

177
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,920
obvious sort of thoughts previewed the,
the idea that,

178
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:03,030
yeah,
I think they're both right.

179
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:03,880
I mean,
I,

180
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:06,140
I do.
Here's a concrete example and,

181
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,090
and I think it,
it proves the case that they're both

182
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:10,390
right.
Um,

183
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,190
the July seventh subway bombings in
London,

184
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,150
um,
I think you can add the evidence is

185
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:23,370
pretty well now established that that
attack was supported by al Qaeda

186
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:28,371
headquarters in Pakistan and was
supported by the travel that some of the

187
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:33,381
participants in the plot undertook to
meet al Qaeda operatives in Waziristan.

188
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:39,030
And on the other hand,
the plot originated spontaneously in the

189
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:43,950
disaffected lives,
have some Pakistani originated British

190
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:47,550
citizens in Leeds.
So on the one hand you could say that

191
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:52,551
attack would never have occurred without
the independent grassroots individually

192
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,640
alienation of the Pakistan Navy,
Britain in leads.

193
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,430
On the other hand,
it would not have occurred also without

194
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,880
the resilient al Qaeda organization.
You can,

195
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,300
it's like an extra drawing.
You can emphasize one side of that

196
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:10,690
equation or the other,
but both are present in the narrative.
