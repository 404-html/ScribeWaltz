1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,600
When I wrote the book,
I was primarily focused on the,

2
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:15,830
on the business situation because I was
looking at how companies can grow and

3
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:17,540
prosper.
And it seemed that empathy was the

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,730
biggest differentiator.
But you know,

5
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:24,731
what I've been most surprised about is
how much empathy is become a larger

6
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:27,440
trend.
Something that is being focused on at

7
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:32,300
the highest levels of government.
Even a Barack Obama has become our chief

8
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:34,230
empathy officer for the country.
Um,

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,340
and I've,
it's just been amazing to see when he

10
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:41,450
was at the saddleback ranch last year
and Rick Warren asked him,

11
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:43,380
why do you want to be pressed at it?
Uh,

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,080
the number one reason he gave was
because his grandmother had taught him

13
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,680
the value of empathy and he felt that
that needed to be brought back to

14
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:53,970
government and to America.
Um,

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,560
and when he was asked to choose the
supreme court nominee,

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,030
Obama said that he was looking for
someone who first and foremost had a

17
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:03,020
sense of empathy.

18
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,340
And this is a big deal.
People kind of flipped out on both sides

19
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:09,100
of the aisle.
And what does he mean by empathy?

20
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:10,700
What is empathy?
A good thing.

21
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:11,810
Is it a bad thing?
Uh,

22
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,790
your people on the right saying that,
oh,

23
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,530
by empathy,
he means we want someone who's a

24
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:18,980
pushover and that's a sign of what's
wrong with this country.

25
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:23,450
It seems like empathy has gotten a bad
rap over the last 50 years in America.

26
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:27,860
We've kind of confused it with me.
Touchy feely or soft minded.

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,521
Um,
when,

28
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:32,510
what it really means is Jesse intuitive
ability to connect with other people.

29
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,080
And Barack gets that and I think he's
leading us to a different place.

30
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,290
It's a sign of Obama's ability to
connect with people that we don't call

31
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:43,680
him President Obama.
We call him barack.

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,250
The people I know referring to him by
his first name.

33
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:47,180
Like he's one of us.
