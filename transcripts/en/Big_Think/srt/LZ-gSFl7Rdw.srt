00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,500
The most inspiring thing

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,520
you see people stepping forward who
really don't have the capacity,

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,810
they don't have the money,
they don't have the time,

4
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,310
they're barely keeping their lives
together and but they still,

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,370
they still make it happen.
They still say,

6
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:30,540
you know,
it's so important.

7
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:35,541
I have to make the time to,
to engage in the political issue,

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,780
whether it's the war on Iraq or
whatever.

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,690
It's a very impressive.
And there,

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,430
there are so many people do step up.
