1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,720
We might've asked rhetorically on whose
taxes the president,

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,310
President Obama wants to increase the
standard journalistic responses.

3
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:12,880
The rich,
my preferred response is Republicans.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,520
Republican voters are disproportionately
wealthy,

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,060
uh,
and he wants to tax Republicans to

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:24,090
reward Democrats they want to cut
spending in order to reduce the deficit.

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,560
And where would they like to reduce
spending entitlements?

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,540
Who disproportionately benefits from
entitlements the relatively poor who

9
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:39,541
disproportionately vote Democrat.
The Republicans want to punish the

10
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:44,650
Democrats to reward their constituents.
The Democrats want to punish the

11
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:46,420
Republicans to reward.
There's,

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,760
how might we fix this?
Well,

13
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,740
it would be nice,
for example,

14
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,581
if a,
we,

15
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:55,810
the people elected the congress instead
of the members of Congress choosing who

16
00:00:55,811 --> 00:01:00,010
their voters will be.
Gerrymandering ensures that the congress

17
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:02,230
gets to pick its voters around the other
way around.

18
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:07,180
So the probability of being reelected as
an incumbent in the congress is 95

19
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:10,090
percent,
almost as high as it was in the old

20
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:12,790
Soviet Union of being reelected to their
parliament.

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,310
Uh,
we've got a rig system.

22
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,270
We could fix that.
Or there are lots of excellent political

23
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:23,680
science studies on how to design a
redistricting.

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,340
So that it's completely nonpartisan.
It's entirely one person,

25
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,330
one vote,
a subject to geographic constraints and

26
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:34,990
topology.
We could write computer programs that do

27
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:35,890
redistricting.
Now,

28
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:39,730
no member of Congress is going to agree
to that in the short term because that

29
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:42,070
would put her or his hold on power at
risk.

30
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:47,260
But if we were to pass a law that says
starting in 20 years or 25 years,

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,140
this program will be used to do
redistricting.

32
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,940
We would have solved the problem of the
voters not choosing their members of

33
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:58,090
Congress.
And that will go a long way to altering

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,540
the risk of being thrown out of office
if you don't do what the,

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,300
what the people want.
And we'd get much better policy.

36
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,450
But that's very far down the road.
Shorter term.

37
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,900
Also hard to do a,
we could get rid of the electoral

38
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:11,790
college.
It's,

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,790
it's useful to remember that,
uh,

40
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,130
you know,
when people speak about standing by the

41
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:22,510
original constitution and so forth,
being strict constitutionalist,

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,130
the electoral college was designed as a
slavery institution.

43
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,520
We got rid of slavery.
We haven't gotten rid of this slavery

44
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:32,190
institution.
We ought to,

45
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,240
that too would ensure,
uh,

46
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:34,811
that,
uh,

47
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:39,760
presidents would be more responsive to a
still larger coalition and that would

48
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,860
mean doing more of what we,
the people want.
