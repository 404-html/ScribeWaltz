1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,430
If you're graduating right now or you've
just graduated,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,910
I would make a very simple observation.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,550
Okay.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,550
Because I think you're very lucky to be
graduating now because 25 years ago when

5
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:20,150
people graduated and went,
let's say,

6
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:25,151
had a job in investment banking and very
successful careers at,

7
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:30,401
let's say today they're in their middle
to late fifties and they've just retired

8
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,370
and you meet them at a cocktail party.
What do they tell you about

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,910
CEO of an investment bank?
They tell you about the peace corps

10
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:43,910
years and what they did in the Peace
Corps.

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,990
I'm saying,
wait a minute,

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,590
you've just had this amazing life and
you're talking about the peace corps.

13
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,270
And then they say,
yeah,

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,400
and now I'm going to use the rest of my
life to do something meaningful,

15
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,970
made a lot of money,
and my kids are graduated empty nest and

16
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:00,350
I now I'm going to do something
meaningful.

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,690
And I say to myself,
wow,

18
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:07,691
here's somebody who graduated and
basically did something meaningless for

19
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:12,050
a period of time and then decided to do
something meaningful.

20
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,860
And the reason I'm so enthusiastic about
people who graduate today is that we're

21
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:22,871
starting to understand that it's
possible to have meaningful lives all

22
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:26,870
the way along and to be a social
entrepreneur.

23
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:29,600
If you want to put your entrepreneurial
energy in that way,

24
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,670
to do things that in fact do mix market
with mission.

25
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,950
It's in fact a period today where you
can take an avocation and turn it into

26
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:45,641
something that's very intimately
connected with what you do and if you

27
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:47,690
are,
you know,

28
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:52,691
toying with taking a job because it pays
well but you hate it,

29
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,010
don't do that.
Don't ever do that because it is be the

30
00:01:58,011 --> 00:02:00,410
saddest peer.
You're going to wake up every morning

31
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:04,580
unless you really wake up and not only
smile about it,

32
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:08,510
but you tell your spouse or your family
what happened.

33
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:11,870
Then how excited you are.
That's the life you want to live in more

34
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:15,770
than ever before.
Lots and lots of people can do that and

35
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:19,790
so that's why I think graduating today
would be really interesting.

36
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,320
30 years ago,
we were a bit more in lockstep,

37
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,550
obedience,
and you did things because you were

38
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:29,090
supposed to,
an opportunity didn't include making the

39
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:29,610
world a better.
