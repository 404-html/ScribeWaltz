1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,033
Yeah,

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,430
democracy can mean a lot of different
things,

3
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:12,860
but at mit,
a bomb to be a democracy,

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,100
we have to have a system that involves
ultimately the judgment of the people

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,460
and the regular judgment worthwhile.
It has to be a judgment where people

6
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:26,380
after console one another,
I think have a democracy to call them in

7
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:31,381
democracy where people don't have a
respect across their differences for the

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,960
co equal people.
On the other side of issues,

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,010
I don't think that's democracy.
Whatever it may be,

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,520
and I think that whatever form you're
voting is whether you have direct

11
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:45,680
representation,
whether you're have indirect

12
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:48,110
representation with a proportional
representation,

13
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,170
what he would like by districts where
they would like by winner take all,

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,900
whatever it may be.
Whatever your voting system is.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,970
Democracy has mainly worked,
precedes the voting democracy,

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,430
is that deliberation amongst citizens
and involve citizens.

17
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:05,720
Beliefs that what we have to think
matters and should matter to each other

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,830
and our ability and our comfort level
with sitting and talking and also

19
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,990
listening,
trying to persuade others,

20
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,600
but first log in to try to persuade.
Awesome.

21
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:17,090
Really allowed the opportunity.
Really listen to what they have to say

22
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:20,030
is they have dismissing it out of him.
That to me is democracy.

23
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,390
It's difficult.
It's rough and tumble.

24
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,120
It doesn't always get quick and
efficient answers,

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,830
but it is the only thing I think I've
been really do in which people actually

26
00:01:30,831 --> 00:01:32,360
participate in governing themselves.
