1
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,290
I don't think so,
some of the basic outlook as it would be

2
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:20,010
that people are monkeys with large
brains,

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,270
period.
And uh,

4
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,180
that's the way you have to think about
it.

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,030
Um,
it,

6
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:29,910
it,
it does,

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,030
it does make me cynical about human
motivation and it,

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,820
it makes me think,
you just have to be very practical,

9
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,380
very realistic.
I don't,

10
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:41,340
I don't have,
I don't,

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,540
I don't put any,
any faith in a utopian.

12
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,150
A drain was,
I don't think people are basically good

13
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:54,730
or anything like that.
Um,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,650
you know,
the promises of politicians and the,

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,890
and the Bologna that judges spew out and
their opinions.

16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,820
I think when one wants to,
Oh,

17
00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:08,300
uh,
uh,

18
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,670
have a caustic view of,
of,

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,700
of people,
of all people,

20
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,100
you know,
you have to be

21
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,210
no recognize if it's severe problems
with criminality.

22
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,270
We also have problems with a no abuse of
authority and,

23
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,820
and with a mistreatment of all sorts of
people and

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,160
overextension of criminal laws,
excessive criminal sentences.

25
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,040
So the,
the,

26
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,910
the problems are everywhere.
I,

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,200
I very much dislike the extremes of left
and right.

28
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,140
Um,
and anything that is faith based,

29
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:55,450
whether it's religious or whether it's
a,

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,770
I mean they,
you know,

31
00:01:56,771 --> 00:02:00,460
the left there just as religious,
they don't have a god,

32
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,050
my sister's religious in the sense that
it's a,

33
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,120
that is based on faith rather than fact.
So I think we should always be trying

34
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:11,720
to,
you know,

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,930
penetrate to the level of fact.
Now the criticism of this,

36
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:20,810
of the pragmatic position is that it's
not enough to know what the facts are.

37
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,430
I know what the consequences are because
they have to be valued.

38
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:26,230
You can't,
you know,

39
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:30,850
there's a disjunction between,
isn't you can infer a lot from as I

40
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,260
agree with that,
but,

41
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,290
but there is a degree of consensus and
society.

42
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,720
So they didn't actually know the
consequences of,

43
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:42,330
um,
of particular

44
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,530
policies,
uh,

45
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,550
that most people will be brought to
because there's a basic moral

46
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,810
man.
I don't like moralistic vocabulary,

47
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,520
moralistic reasoning.
But obviously there is more,

48
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:04,570
there are people have moral
feelings,

49
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:08,480
they do react to things.
So you know,

50
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,310
if everything was known about abortion,
who gets it,

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,430
why there are other ways of preventing
that,

52
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,810
this and that.
The other thing,

53
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,710
he really understood it.
I think we would

54
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,510
get most people,
not 100 percent,

55
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,150
but maybe 60 percent would think,
yes,

56
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:29,880
this is what and how is she.
