00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,920
Viral Mark Zuckerberg for a day.
First,

2
00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:05,250
I would buy more hoodies in different
colors.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,690
The second I would discuss with my
senior team,

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,640
the practice of edgerank as it impacts
people's personal profiles,

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,060
so visa vi brands were brands are
getting less organic views so they have

6
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:26,280
to pay up to promote.
Hallelujah.

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,580
Take them for all you can.
You deserve that,

8
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:35,270
but I think that it's kind of dangerous
where trixie and biff,

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,530
if they have a baby or if they graduate
from college and they put up their

10
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:44,070
graduation picture,
I think they think that if they have a

11
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,330
thousand followers,
all thousand people can see it and from

12
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:50,370
what I've heard,
and I don't know if it's true,

13
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:53,910
but if it's true,
not 1000 people will see it.

14
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:58,530
Maybe 100 people will see it.
And I think that if trixie and bf start

15
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:03,531
losing confidence that facebook is the
way to post their life story to

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,040
everybody who has voluntarily follow
them,

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,400
that you could be throwing out the baby
with the bathwater.

18
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,260
And if enough people think this way and
they stop using facebook,

19
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,530
then you won't be able to charge the
brands for promoting their posts.

20
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,930
So again,
I'm on the outside looking in.

21
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:28,260
I know how these algorithms work,
if there are any algorithms like that.

22
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:30,600
But I think that's really playing with
fire.
