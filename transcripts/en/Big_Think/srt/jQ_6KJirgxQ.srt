1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,990
One of the things that I think companies
do to a large degree that makes very

2
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:11,991
little sense is the use of focus groups,
so think about what a strange idea is

3
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:17,151
that we take 10 people who know
basically nothing about your project and

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,460
you put them in a room and you let them
talk for awhile and then you take the

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,030
whatever they came up with as a
consequence of these two hours of random

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,520
thinking and you base your strategy on
it to a large degree and,

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,090
and I,
I don't want to say that focus groups

8
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:32,400
are always useless and also
uninformative,

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,750
but I think that taking this data and
then realizing it as extensively as

10
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:38,730
companies do,
I think.

11
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:43,080
I think it's crazy in many ways and the
reason I think companies do it is

12
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:46,710
because when these people create a
sentence or an idea,

13
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:51,711
it's very easy to say,
joe focus group 17 said this and it can

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,270
help you create a form.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,800
Formulate an idea around it.
When if you said 87 percent of the

16
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:01,800
people said x,
it just doesn't have a face.

17
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:05,040
It doesn't have a desire.
It's just not as concrete and therefore

18
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:08,370
people are not as excited about the,
about the notion.

19
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:12,240
So I think that focus group is
incredibly useful as a persuasive

20
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,890
attempt,
uh,

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,240
to,
to tell people what to do,

22
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:20,130
but as a way to find out information,
it's not as useful as people think it

23
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:23,160
is.
The other thing that really puzzles me

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,280
is that company is how little they
understand about how incentives really

25
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:32,040
work.
So the biggest expenditure for almost

26
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:35,430
any company is salaries.
And you ask people what do you know

27
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:38,190
about the relationship between salaries
and performance?

28
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,710
The answer is nothing.
Right?

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,720
And,
and the question is why don't they study

30
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:44,460
anything?
Why don't they study,

31
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:46,050
why don't they try different
performance,

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,860
different incentive level and see how it
influenced a performance.

33
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,510
And they often say,
well,

34
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,630
the law kind of low laws and if we have
pay some people one way and some another

35
00:01:56,881 --> 00:02:00,000
way we might be sued.
And when the last two years with all

36
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:03,240
these questions about bonuses and so on,
I've gone to many companies and said,

37
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,770
why don't we at least do some surveys?
Why don't we at least see how happy

38
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:10,320
people are on the months when they give
them,

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,510
you give them the bonus and how
productive they are,

40
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,680
and the answer I got 100 percent of the
time is that people are really miserable

41
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,100
in bold decision and because of that
they don't want to ask them any more

42
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:23,370
questions and I said,
if people are miserable in bonuses and

43
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:25,020
shouldn't it mean that you should study
it,

44
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:28,620
understand it and try to prevent it from
next for next year and say,

45
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:29,850
well,
well not this year.

46
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,990
This year was really miserable.
Maybe next year come back to us next

47
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,100
year,
but if you think about.

48
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:38,100
It's really incredible.
Now how do companies decided about

49
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:41,160
compensation?
They look at what other companies are

50
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,580
doing and try to equate compensation to
what other companies are doing it,

51
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,070
but it's a place of the blind leading
the blind.

52
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,810
Right?
And then if we pay five percent more,

53
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:52,170
other people will start doing it.
But the real question is how do you pay

54
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:56,070
and how do you get people to care about
their work and become more productive

55
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,120
and be happier at their work?
And the answer is not simply that more

56
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:04,060
money is better,
more money can be part of the equation,

57
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:06,190
but it's also the question of how do you
give that money?

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,310
You give it a bonus to give it as a
fixed salary.

59
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,160
Do you give it as a part of the
benefits?

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,610
Maybe you give benefits for the gym.
Do you send people on vacation to the

61
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:18,190
Bahamas?
And it turns out that there are ways to

62
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:21,820
use money that he's cannot make the less
efficient,

63
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,490
but actually get people to be more
motivated,

64
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,560
caremore and actually become more
productive.
