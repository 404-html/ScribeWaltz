1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
Mm,

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,580
all systems of oppression are highly
adaptive and they can adapt to

3
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:13,420
challenges and incorporate them.
They can allow for exceptions,

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,650
and I think the most effective
adaptation of the system of racism to

5
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:22,450
the challenges of the civil rights
movement was to reduce a racist to a

6
00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:26,020
very simple formula.
A racist is an individual,

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,670
always an individual,
not a system who consciously does not

8
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:35,470
like people based on race must be
conscious and who intentionally seeks to

9
00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:39,040
be mean to them.
Individual conscious intent.

10
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,550
And if that is my definition of a
racist,

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,850
then your suggestion that anything I've
said or done is racist or has a racist

12
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:51,280
impact.
I'm going to hear that as you just said,

13
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:54,820
I was a bad person.
You just put me over there in that

14
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:58,360
category.
And most of my bias anyway is

15
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:00,470
unconscious.
So I,

16
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,800
I'm not intending,
I'm not aware.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,160
Uh,
so now I'm going to need to defend my

18
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:07,540
moral character.
And,

19
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,850
and I will,
and we've all seen it.

20
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,180
It seems to be virtually impossible
based on that definition for the average

21
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:18,700
white person to look deeply at their
socialization,

22
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,710
to look at the inevitability of
internalizing racist biases,

23
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,770
developing racist patterns,
and having investments in the system of

24
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:32,080
racism,
which is pretty comfortable for us and

25
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:36,400
serves us really well.
I think that definition of a racist that

26
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:40,390
either or what I call the good bad
binary is the root of virtually all

27
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:44,650
white defensiveness on this topic
because it makes it virtually impossible

28
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:49,651
to talk to the average white person
about the inevitable absorption of a

29
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:55,471
racist worldview that we get by being
literally swimming in racist water.

30
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,120
So let me connect that to myself as a
result of being raised as a white person

31
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,110
in this society.

32
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,830
I have a racist worldview.
I have a deep racist biases.

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,750
I have developed a racist patterns and I
have investments in the system of racism

34
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:13,810
because it's served me really well.
It's comfortable.

35
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:18,490
It's helped me overcome the barriers
that I do face and I also have an

36
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:23,200
investment and not seeing any of that
for what it would suggest to me about my

37
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:25,930
identity and what it would require of
me.

38
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,900
Right.
I didn't choose any of that.

39
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,040
I don't feel guilty about it.
It isn't inevitable result of being

40
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,730
raised in this society in which racism
is the bedrock.

41
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,070
The question of guilt comes in in what
am I doing about that?

42
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,780
While we who are white tend to be
fragile in that it doesn't take much to

43
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:51,781
upset us around race.
The impact of our response is not

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,500
fragile at all.
It's a kind of weaponized defensiveness,

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,260
weaponized hurt feelings,
right,

46
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,840
and it functions really,
really effectively to repel the

47
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:05,674
challenge.

48
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,260
There was a white person,
I moved through the world,

49
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,290
racially comfortable,
virtually 24 slash seven.

50
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,550
It is exceptional for me to be outside
of my racial comfort zone and most of my

51
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:21,811
life I've been warned not to go outside
my racial comfort zone and so on the

52
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:26,350
rare occasion when I am uncomfortable
racially,

53
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,130
it's.
It's a kind of throwing off of my racial

54
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,160
equilibrium and I need to get back into
that and so I will do whatever it takes

55
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,620
to repel the challenge and get back into
it and in that way I think white

56
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:44,740
fragility functions as a kind of white
racial bullying.

57
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,860
To be frank,
we make it so miserable for people of

58
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:55,141
color to talk to us about are inevitable
and often unaware of racist patterns

59
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,870
that we cannot help develop from being
socialized into a culture in which

60
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:03,370
racism is the bedrock and the
foundation.

61
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,780
We make it so miserable for them to talk
to us about it that most of the time

62
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:12,760
they don't just and we just have to
understand that most people of color

63
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,820
that are working or living in primarily
white environments take home way more

64
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:23,791
daily slights and hurts and insults than
they bother talking to us about

65
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,620
because their experiences,
they're going to risk more punishment.

66
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,850
They're going to lose the relationship.
They're going to have their experience

67
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:36,040
minimized,
explained away.

68
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,420
They're going to cause the person to
feel attacked or hurt.

69
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,560
And in that way,
white fragility functions as a kind of

70
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:49,270
everyday white racial control.
None of that has to be intentional or

71
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:52,750
conscious,
but that is how it functions and it's

72
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:57,751
actually incredibly liberating and
transformative to start from the premise

73
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,030
that,
of course I've internalized all of this

74
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,570
and then I can stop defending,
deflecting,

75
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,760
denying,
hoping you won't notice,

76
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,500
minimizing,
explaining,

77
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,220
and I can just let go of that and get to
work.

78
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,580
And there's a question that's never
failed me in my efforts to unpack.

79
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,570
How do we pull this off?
How do so many of us who are white

80
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,580
individually feel so free of racism and
yet we live in a society that is so

81
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:31,960
profoundly separate and unequal by race.
And the question that's never failed me

82
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:34,420
is not,
is this true or is this false?

83
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,280
Is this writer,
is this wrong?

84
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,260
But how does it function?
How do these narratives that I tell,

85
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,040
how do they function when I tell you,
well,

86
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:48,220
I'm just an individual.
Why can't we all just be individuals?

87
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,640
When I tell you I was taught to treat
everyone the same.

88
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,810
When I tell you what it's focusing on
race that divides us.

89
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,510
When I tell you I have lots of friends
of color,

90
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,050
those narratives have not changed our
outcome and they functioned to take race

91
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,580
off the table and to exempt the person
from any further engagement,

92
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,720
and in doing that,
they functioned to protect the current

93
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:19,730
racial hierarchy in the white position
within it.

94
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,880
It doesn't have to be what I'm intending
to do,

95
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,810
but it is the impact of those
narratives.
