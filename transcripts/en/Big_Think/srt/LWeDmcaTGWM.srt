1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,540
I think the European Union is superbly
positioned to become a major player in

2
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:12,080
the 21st century.
Um,

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,830
and it has done quite well.
Uh,

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,130
the common currency,
uh,

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,993
the,
uh,

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,090
centralization necessary centralization
coordination through European law,

7
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:25,160
European courts,
um,

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,820
have done a great deal of good to the
continent that was divided.

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,890
Uh,
so along I think Europe faces two

10
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:39,210
fundamental challenges that are very
hard to overcome.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,570
The first challenge is the demographic
challenge and gray and continent,

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,080
um,
Europe is growing much faster than the

13
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:51,081
United States is.
And so Europe has to deal with that

14
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:53,270
problem.
Uh,

15
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,170
that means that not only there are more
people who want to retire and,

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,240
uh,
and get up state pension.

17
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,080
That means that every year you have
about 2 million people that are missing

18
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:07,320
in the workforce because they retire and
you need to replenish them.

19
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,880
Um,
2 million,

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,950
that means 2 million immigrants from
somewhere.

21
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,860
Uh,
there isn't a country close to Europe,

22
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:17,280
large enough to supply to a million
immigrants a year,

23
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,200
let alone the,
the question of cohesion of integrating

24
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:27,201
these people into the European culture.
So Europe has in faces a huge challenge,

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,190
uh,
much more so than the United States do.

26
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,680
You had a challenge,
of course is.

27
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,500
Um,
and that's the beauty of the United

28
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,300
States.
The beauty of the United States is that

29
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:38,400
it,
it pushes itself to the brink,

30
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,380
but it never falls off.
Uh,

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,450
once it's at the brink,
even extremely close to it then comes

32
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:46,920
back.
Um,

33
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,230
and it retains its unique spirit of
entrepreneurship and innovativeness.

34
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,450
Uh,
Europe needs to,

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,840
uh,
begin to harness that and begin to

36
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:03,810
belief in its own ability to be
entrepreneurial,

37
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:05,220
creative,
and innovative,

38
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,980
uh,
and to believe in itself.

39
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,200
So far it hasn't done that.
It's still always eyeing towards the

40
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,920
United States.
Um,

41
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,380
I think a little bit more self
confidence would do it good.
