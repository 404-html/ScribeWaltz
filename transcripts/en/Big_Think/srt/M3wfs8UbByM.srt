1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,320
I don't know when it happened in the
history,

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,910
but we become obsessed with the concept
of having a vision.

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,310
Right?
And there's this overwhelming pressure

4
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:17,530
on entrepreneurs or any of us for that
matter,

5
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:19,540
that we all have to have a vision.
People even ask us.

6
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,030
So what's your vision?
What's your vision in your job?

7
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:23,770
What kind of vision do you want to build
or follow?

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,200
And at the end of the day,
we're not all visionaries.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,420
Um,
we don't all have big change.

10
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:31,510
The world's kind of visions.
And even if we have some sense of it,

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,010
very few of us are really capable or
able of articulating that vision and

12
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:40,270
words so clearly than others could
imagine that same world that we imagine

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,720
sometimes it's just a feeling.
And so I think it puts an unfair stress

14
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:47,050
and an unfair burden on all of us that
we have to have a vision.

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,660
I don't know.
I just want to go to work and be happy

16
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:51,970
and feel like my life and my work is
valuable.

17
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,470
Do I need more than that?
But I do believe we have to find

18
00:00:56,471 --> 00:00:58,570
division.
We have to have direction.

19
00:00:58,571 --> 00:01:01,720
We have to have a north star.
We have to know where we're going.

20
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,030
It doesn't have to be the direction we
set.

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,770
It can be the direction that somebody
else said.

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,570
So it's very important for us to find a
leader or find a company or find a

23
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:15,571
vision in whom we believe so that our
work is contributing to building that.

24
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,230
So,
you know,

25
00:01:17,231 --> 00:01:20,650
and the civil rights era,
some may not have been able to clearly

26
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:22,150
articulate the vision that they
imagined,

27
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:24,910
but Martin Luther King did.
And so for the rest of us,

28
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:26,650
we said,
I'm following him.

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,220
I'm following that vision.
That's the vision I believe in.

30
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,580
And that's the point.
We should all find division that we

31
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:36,790
believe in.
We should find common direction and then

32
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:40,750
that vision can become ours.
But we don't have to invent it and we

33
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:43,180
don't have to originate it.
But we absolutely have the

34
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:45,730
responsibility to find a person,
company,

35
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:46,960
or other,
uh,

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,011
uh,
entity out there,

37
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:52,960
other person or organization that puts
in towards the vision that we absolutely

38
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:56,200
believe in and would commit our blood
and sweat and tears to help build.

39
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,200
If we do not have that fire in our
belly,

40
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,180
the way we go about igniting it is not
actually to set out on a journey of self

41
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:05,770
discovery and do everything by
ourselves,

42
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:09,040
but rather to ask for help.
The whole point is that we are better

43
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,330
together.
I,

44
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:13,600
I'm,
I sort of joke about the fact that

45
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,580
there's an entire section in the
bookshop called self help,

46
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,330
but there's no section in the bookshop
called help others.

47
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,960
At the end of the day,
it's not about how I can find the job of

48
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:24,870
my dreams.
It's the question is,

49
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:29,260
is how can I help my friends find a
career of endless fulfillment.

50
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,640
It's not about how I can lose 10 pounds.
It's how can I help my friend that

51
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:37,120
somebody I love live a healthy
lifestyle.

52
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,340
And the amazing thing is is that when
we're willing to ask for help or when

53
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:44,770
we're willing to set ourselves out there
to help others,

54
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,470
that in itself helps us solve our own
problems.

55
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,310
So the irony is,
is the way to ignite the fire in our

56
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:54,970
bellies is to help others ignite the
fire.

57
00:02:54,971 --> 00:02:58,660
And there is an in so doing,
we will find the thing that excites us.

58
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,410
People often ask me for good examples of
vision,

59
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,670
you know,
and uh,

60
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:07,030
I don't believe vision should be
something that is if theorial it

61
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:08,590
shouldn't be something that lives in our
imaginations,

62
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:11,470
I believe visions and positionings or
whatever you wanna call them.

63
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,350
I like to call it the why.
And it's why we get out of bed every

64
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:16,270
morning.
It's why our organization exists.

65
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,230
And one of my favorite expressions of
the why is the declaration of

66
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:21,400
independence.
You know,

67
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:25,450
why does America Exist?
While we actually declared it,

68
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:28,810
we actually declared why we needed our
own country,

69
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:31,090
why we needed to separate from Great
Britain.

70
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,010
And we said,
because we had a simple belief,

71
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,290
we believe that all men were created
equal,

72
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,720
that every single one of us was
entitled,

73
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:41,260
endowed with these unalienable rights
amongst which include life,

74
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,730
liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,340
In other words,
a north star was set for this country.

76
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,870
And when we are at our natural best,
we are working hard to provide equality

77
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:52,030
for all women's suffrage,
civil rights,

78
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,500
gay,
gay rights.

79
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,600
You know the ability for everybody to go
to school,

80
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:58,210
the ability for everybody,
every child have a doctor.

81
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,060
This is what,
when we are at our natural best,

82
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:03,700
when we're trying to figure it out,
none of the systems are perfect,

83
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,920
but my goodness,
when we try hard,

84
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,720
we're trying to advance the equality of
all that is when America is actually

85
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:14,770
America and we know that to be the case
because it's not up for debate.

86
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,370
It's because it was written down for us
and so great organizations,

87
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,990
they should also declare why we need
them to exist because it certainly ain't

88
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:25,390
in their product because none of them
have a product that's that special that

89
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:27,310
we have to have it and we can't get it
from someone else.

90
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,790
And even if they did,
it's temporary and that's the point.

91
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,490
The product ain't it.
It's the declaration.

92
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,290
It's the reason why we need you to
exist.

93
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:39,370
It's your idealism and your ambition for
the world in which you operate,

94
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,660
that you hope to advance.

95
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,780
Thomas Jefferson said himself the
declaration of independence.

96
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,990
The statement that he had was for the
whole world,

97
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,360
but America would take it upon
themselves to lead,

98
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:52,750
to try to be the experiment.
So too should be the visions of

99
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,700
companies,
the visions that we have should be for

100
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:56,020
every company,
for everyone,

101
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,740
but we will take it upon ourselves to
make our organization the example of

102
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:02,950
what great looks like.
I love the declaration of independence,

103
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,950
and it is written in such a perfect form
to,

104
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,400
it doesn't start by complaining.
It starts by idealizing,

105
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,760
and then it gets into all of the things
that are in the way the of the,

106
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,830
of this ideal.
And that's what we set out to overcome.
