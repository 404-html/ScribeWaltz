1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,460
I must say I've come to it very much as
a human rights issue because when I've

2
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:08,970
been in African countries doing my
current work on health,

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,950
on decent work,
on women's leadership,

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,340
people would sort of change the subjects
they but what can we do?

5
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:17,490
We've no seasons anymore and our farming
is destroyed.

6
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:21,030
Farmers don't have winter,
so it's undermining everything and then

7
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:26,031
I realized that in fact the reality is
that our carbon based lifestyles

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,670
creating these greenhouse gas emissions
are already affecting the poorest and in

9
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:36,210
a way I think that's not the way we hear
about climate change.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,110
We hear it from scientists and
environmentalist and economists and they

11
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:44,040
have important things to say,
but they're talking statistics and a

12
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:48,100
polar bear on a melting ice floe and
glaciers melting people's earlier

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,490
started going to be a problem in the
future for many,

14
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:51,390
many poor people.

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,310
It's a problem now and it's undermining
their poor life chances and it could

16
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:58,740
lead to conflict.
When you have water stress,

17
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,000
when you have people migrating,
they estimate that by 2050 we could have

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,780
more than $200,
million environmental climate change.

19
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:10,410
Migrants who've had to move either
within the countries are very often

20
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:12,690
across borders.
Many of them will want to come to

21
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:14,750
Europe.
They want to come from,

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,670
you know,
South America more to the United States

23
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,330
if they find arid conditions where they
can't continue to where they live,

24
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,210
other flooded,
and these are unfortunately the threats.

25
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,250
So we need,
again,

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,990
a developmental approach.
We need,

27
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:31,500
in fact,
to ensure that we mitigate our own

28
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:33,750
carbon.
We can all do more about that,

29
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:36,270
including me.
I travel on airplanes a lot.

30
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:40,710
I'm trying to think how to video more
and to be able to be more energy

31
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:42,090
efficient in our home,
et cetera.

32
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,420
But,
uh,

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,390
also we need to help countries that are
in poor parts of the world where they

34
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:52,160
suffer much more from any slight change
in climbers.

35
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,840
They have no insurance and they're
devastated.

36
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,700
Look at what's happening in Pakistan at
the moment.
