1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,423
Mm.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,190
The contemporary Internet is based on a
fundamental lie.

3
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:13,180
We all are told that it's social.
We're all told they did.

4
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:16,630
Now it's connectivity allows us to
create community,

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,080
but the reverse is actually true.
It's atomizing us.

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:25,120
It's not creating real community.
It's actually separating us from people

7
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:27,760
have different opinions of different
cultures.

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,990
It's increasingly an echo chamber effect
where we're only ever connected with

9
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,790
people who agree with us in the first
place,

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,180
but even more troubling.
These social networks aren't really

11
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:40,180
social.
They're platforms for the self that

12
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:43,540
plops for that platforms.
For us to build brands.

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,290
The clearest manifestation of this is
our obsession with the selfie.

14
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,010
The selfie becomes the cultural form of
the Internet.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,180
Wherever we go,
we picture ourselves in front of

16
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:57,550
mausoleums in front of,
as I say in the book,

17
00:00:57,551 --> 00:01:02,551
in front of people committing suicide at
Auschwitz at every imaginable place.

18
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,520
In spite of all the bad taste associated
with it.

19
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,410
We are in our minds at least are diluted
minds.

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,460
The center of our universe.
I argue again in terms of progress,

21
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:19,090
that we've gone back to a a pre
kapernick and understanding of the

22
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:21,940
universe where everything of revolves
around us.

23
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,570
There's nothing social about that and
the end consequences two fold.

24
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:28,030
Firstly,
we're making complete fools of ourselves

25
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,360
that narcissism,
that indulgence is embarrassing,

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,450
and in the long run,
we're going to regret it both as a

27
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:38,560
species and individually.
When we look back at those absurd photos

28
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:42,190
of herself where we're shamelessly
exposing,

29
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,450
uh,
our own self importance,

30
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,520
we're going to be severely embarrassed
by it.

31
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,940
But secondly,
it also reflects the reality of the

32
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:54,310
Internet.
It's about the individual.

33
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,630
It's not about the social and the
Internet is alienating,

34
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,300
isolating,
fragmenting ourselves.

35
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,600
It's weakening community.
That's of course the reason why it

36
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:06,640
hasn't generated real political
movements.

37
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,480
It creates explosions.
The Arab spring occupy,

38
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,030
but no legacy,
no political parties,

39
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:16,360
no movements,
no real foundations of political change.
