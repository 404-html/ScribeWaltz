1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,800
Well,
I happened to be a fan of democracy.

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,420
I think it has flaws,
but there was just no other better

3
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:17,660
system for one simple reason,
and that is you can often get a bit

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,560
inefficient dictator.
A lot of people think that Lee Kuan Yew

5
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:22,930
in Singapore was such a person.
He was not corrupt.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,990
He actually alleviated a lot of the
ethnic conflict.

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,190
But here's the problem.
You could never ensure that the dictator

8
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:34,690
will stay beneficence,
and the better thing about democracy is

9
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:38,650
that eventually you can vote them out.
If you don't like the policies.

10
00:00:38,651 --> 00:00:40,960
If you don't like the leaders,
you can vote them out.

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,170
So on balance,
I think that democracy is the best

12
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:47,770
system.
What I think is wrong is that America

13
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,640
treats democracy like a panacea.
We romanticize it.

14
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,530
We think somehow that,
oh,

15
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:57,850
there's all this civil war and tribalism
and sectarian warfare there.

16
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,260
Let's just have some elections.
What they don't realize is that in very

17
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:05,350
divided countries,
ethnically divided,

18
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:10,351
tribally divided democracy can sometimes
capitalize group conflict rather than

19
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:15,540
softening it.
A lot of people have puzzled over how so

20
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:20,380
many blue collar and working class
Americans could possibly have voted for

21
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:24,220
a billionaire born to wealth born in
Manhattan,

22
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,020
but it's actually not a puzzle at all.
What a lot of working class Americans

23
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,650
resent is the idea that there's a rigged
system,

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,300
that there are these people,
arrogant people controlling the leavers

25
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:40,570
of power from afar,
somewhere in DC and on Wall Street and

26
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:43,450
Silicon Valley.
If you look at the surveys,

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,960
Pew Foundation Studies,
you find that most Americans,

28
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,280
including working class Americans
actually love capitalism.

29
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,880
They don't want socialism.
They still want a system where you could

30
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,220
work hard,
you can strike it rich,

31
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:59,740
and they want it to be fine to be rich.

32
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,420
Study show that many working class
Americans actually resent the

33
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:08,080
professional elites bore the very
polished,

34
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,120
well-educated snobby professors and
journalists and pundits speaking on TV

35
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,250
and that they don't actually dislike the
Kardashians so much,

36
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,160
or the billionaires that are jet setting
around.

37
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,340
That's why shows like the apprentice are
so popular.

38
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,400
The occupy movement in many important
things highlighting the urgency of

39
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:33,610
inequality in this country,
but one problem with the occupy movement

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,410
is that it was a movement that purported
to want to help the poor that didn't

41
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,930
actually include any members of the
poor.

42
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,980
It was overwhelmingly an extremely
privileged movement,

43
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:49,981
not necessarily wealthy,
but highly educated and largely from

44
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:54,670
cosmopolitan urban areas,
and if you look at the interviews of

45
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:57,850
people from other parts of the country
working class people,

46
00:02:57,851 --> 00:03:00,460
blue collar people,
it's not just that they didn't

47
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:04,150
participate in these activist anti
quality movements.

48
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,500
They actually were very suspicious of
them and even a little scornful.

49
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,190
The interviews have people saying,
don't these people have jobs?

50
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,460
Don't they have to work?
I'm working three jobs just to put food

51
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,680
on the table.
How can they be marching and protesting

52
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:18,940
all the time?
Now,

53
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:22,120
that's a little unfair because a lot of
these activists movements have done

54
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:25,810
tremendous good,
but it is also true that it is a

55
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:30,220
privilege to have the time to take off
work and to do these things.

56
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,190
So there's a real schism in group
identities.

57
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:38,080
A lot of America's elites,
while they were campaigning for Bernie

58
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:42,220
or hillary,
didn't really connect with so many of

59
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:47,221
the lower income Americans because in
part they had a snobby view towards

60
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:50,320
them,
but the point is that a lot of America's

61
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:52,870
political elites,
the establishment elites,

62
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,090
just really didn't bother to get to
understand the people that supposedly

63
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:59,170
they were trying to help.

64
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,850
It's amazing to contrast the occupied
movement with the Prosperity Gospel.

65
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,330
The irony is just glaring so occupy was
a movement championing supposedly the

66
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:14,640
underclasses,
but largely driven by elites.

67
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,510
The Prosperity Gospel is a hugely
popular movement in America.

68
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,290
What are the most powerful religious
movements in the United States that is

69
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,950
very largely populated by disadvantaged
Americans,

70
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,190
including our most disadvantaged
minorities?

71
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,560
African Americans and Hispanic Americans
are flocking to the Prosperity Gospel.

72
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,940
What is their creed that God blesses the
wealthy,

73
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,010
that being rich is divine,
and that if you pray for wealth hard

74
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:46,990
enough,
God will give it to you.

75
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,500
And this contrast just shows the tribal
chasm between America's haves and have

76
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:56,660
nots.
You have people purporting to want to

77
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,210
help the other side and yet actually
scorning the very movements that those

78
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:04,870
people actually belong to.
We have a strange relationship with

79
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:08,470
celebrity culture in America,
and in some ways you could see the

80
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:13,471
victory of Donald Trump as Donald Trump
tapping into this obsession with

81
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,070
celebrities.

82
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,290
It's almost like he's created a kind of
billionaire populism where he's tapping

83
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:25,240
into this desire for a lot of working
class people to rise in a system where

84
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,600
they can no longer rise,
where there's so much inequality that

85
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:32,110
they can't just make it with hard work
and they romanticize that.

86
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:32,944
They think,
you know what?

87
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,910
If I go on American idol or the voice or
shark tank,

88
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,970
maybe I can hit it big and they actually
glorify all the desperate housewives or

89
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:47,980
the Kardashians or the celebrity
musicians and actresses.

90
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,470
These are beloved figures.
They're not hated it all.

91
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:55,270
It's like the royal family in England.
The desire for the American dream is so

92
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:59,330
powerful that people will cling to it
even when they have no chance.

93
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,720
Even when the American dream turned
their backs on,

94
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:07,721
people mocks them.
A lot of Americans would sooner turn on

95
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,050
immigrants,
outsiders even reason itself.

96
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,950
Then turn on the American dream.
I'm a lot of people think,

97
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:18,110
why is this happening now?
You know,

98
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,670
what,
what's going on with our society?

99
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,200
Well,
it's always been there.

100
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,180
A lot of these issues have always been
there.

101
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:27,170
There's always been a,
these male bosses that have done these

102
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:29,780
terrible things.
So it's not like it's all happening now.

103
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,250
It's just that finally certain groups
voices are allowed to be heard.

104
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,700
It the same with,
um,

105
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,580
a lot of diversity issues.
You know,

106
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:40,460
people will say,
why now are there so many minorities

107
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:43,910
complaining on campuses or in this
organization,

108
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,500
it used to be so smooth.
Things used to work so well.

109
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,670
Well that's because so many voices used
to be suppressed.

110
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,020
So in a way I think it's healthy.
What's often experienced as turbulence

111
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:58,340
and chaos,
oh my gosh,

112
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:02,240
everything's going haywire is actually a
healthy,

113
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,440
a rising of certain voices that
historically have not been allowed to

114
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:08,570
speak.
And there are lots of different groups.

115
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:10,790
It's a long all kinds of different
lines,

116
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,780
gender,
race,

117
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:12,950
ethnicity.
Because I mean,

118
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:13,341
it's,
it's,

119
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:13,970
it's everything.
