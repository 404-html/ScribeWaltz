1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,493
No,

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,760
I did not collect the tomes written for
one kind of high,

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,890
had relatively little to do with that
book.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,070
That book was collected largely by
attorneys who volunteer their time to

5
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:23,220
work with people who were detained often
with minimal,

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,540
amazingly minimal,
uh,

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,190
legal process,
uh,

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,310
people who were detained at Guantanamo.
And,

9
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:30,810
uh,
I would assume with that,

10
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:33,810
knowing very little about it,
there's a tremendous range,

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,640
uh,
people,

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,230
uh,
uh,

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,620
range,
culturally range of a bunch shirt ranges

14
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:43,910
for people who are tremendously guilty
of many things.

15
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:45,930
The people who were really center,
many,

16
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:50,931
many things.
I'm the editor at the press.

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,950
It was about to publish that book.
Originally talked to me about writing an

18
00:00:55,951 --> 00:01:00,951
introduction and uh,
they sent me the manuscript.

19
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,800
I tried conscientiously to read the
poems and uh,

20
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,850
I hope I correctly recognized my own
inadequacy.

21
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,970
I was not going to be able to write
introduction to these palms.

22
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,220
You would have to,
at the minimum,

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,340
you would have to know something about
Arabic poetry.

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,520
You would have to know a little bit
about these cultures.

25
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,630
And uh,
they come from cultures in which amateur

26
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:29,580
poetry is a very important component.
I'm familiar with amateur poetry,

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,510
this country.
I've taught adult classes.

28
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:33,620
I've taught in prisons.
Uh,

29
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,700
I don't say amateur with a sneer.
Um,

30
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,300
in many ways it's possible to idealize
the country in which there's a lot of

31
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:44,420
amateur poetry.
You know,

32
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:46,600
it might be good for professionals like
me.

33
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,973
Uh,

34
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,440
but I felt inadequate to writing the
introduction.

35
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,980
And at the same time,
uh,

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I felt strongly about the abuses,
civil liberties and,

37
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:03,960
uh,
that,

38
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:08,340
uh,
military people were shocked.

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,010
Millet,
people in military people,

40
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,140
uh,
legal,

41
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,020
military people were appalled at what
was happening there.

42
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,150
And these guys who've just been a
tremendous fixed the pickle they were

43
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:23,940
in,
they'd been put in by the government of

44
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:26,040
my country.
I didn't want to just say,

45
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:26,821
oh,
I'm so sorry.

46
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:31,080
This is not my field.
So I tried to write a blurb,

47
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,510
um,
that would at least put my name in the

48
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:35,670
book and say,
this is an urgent book for us to be

49
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,470
aware of when you're thinking about
these people.

50
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,110
Uh,
they shouldn't just be sealed away.

51
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,330
Uh,
and,

52
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,680
um,
apart from leasing from a government

53
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:47,330
that we don't work it as a part of Cuba.
Uh,

54
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,250
if you read that in facilities Hurghada
disputes,

55
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:51,820
I can't figure these people,
I don't know what,

56
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:53,010
what,
what's going on here.

57
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:55,500
Anyway,
there they are in this part of Cuba that

58
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:58,170
we lease from this government.
We refuse to have anything to do with

59
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,240
and uh,
we must have just forget about them.

60
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,160
Uh,
they need to be thought about.

61
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,383
And,
uh,

62
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,530
I was speaking because I had been
appealed to it.

63
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,840
We've very aware that my gifts and
knowledge,

64
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,460
uh,
whatever they are as a poet,

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,640
we're not terrifically Germane to the
content.

66
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,260
To that point.
