1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,033
Yeah.

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,120
In Martin Luther King would be the
number one person.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,000
Um,
it's just so amazing that guy,

4
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:17,490
you know,
and I wish he was alive today,

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,550
uh,
because I won't again to his head and

6
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:23,400
just find out what he was thinking when
he said things.

7
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:24,810
So when he,
you know,

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,110
went to,
uh,

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,710
to lead them,
uh,

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,140
uh,
a protest or what have you.

11
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:31,974
So,
uh,

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,190
he was such an amazing guy and a,
you know,

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,080
I think he's influenced my life a lot,
then he will be the number one person I

14
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,730
want to talk with,
you know,

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,350
um,
I,

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,940
I love Mandela or also,
um,

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,550
hey,
these are just incredible guys that come

18
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:49,350
once in a while,
you know,

19
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,840
uh,
maybe Obama would be the next one,

20
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:53,730
so we'll see.
But,

21
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,630
uh,
you know,

22
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:57,250
you don't get a lot of these people,
you know,

23
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,450
who you can look up to as mentors,
you know,

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,730
um,
uh,

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,530
you know,
two great icons like that.

26
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,950
And,
and unfortunately some of these big icon

27
00:01:08,951 --> 00:01:12,060
stays always tragedies surrounding them.
You know,

28
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:15,120
and I am not,
I've never been able to,

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,180
to understand why must you have a
tragedy for someone to be such a great

30
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:21,740
icon,
you know?

31
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:22,603
But yeah.

32
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,440
Ah.
