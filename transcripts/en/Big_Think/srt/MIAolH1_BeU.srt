1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,250
So some identities

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,490
are those philosophies would say
determined it simple determinable,

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,770
so somewhere like race,
uh,

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,320
in principle,
uh,

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,330
you know,
the racial system is laid out so that

6
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:22,350
you have to be of either a mixed race or
one of the races and you can't be,

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,650
as it were,
black and an Asian at the same time.

8
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,500
You can be mixed race,
but you can't be straightforwardly Asian

9
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:30,090
and straightforward,
be black at the same time.

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,030
Uh,
so in that sense that mutual exclusivity

11
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:36,300
is built into the structure of some
kinds of identity,

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,990
but there's nothing in general about
identities that excludes the overlap of

13
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:45,120
different forms of identity,
of gender and race and sexual

14
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:49,650
orientation,
religion and nationality in class or in

15
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:52,200
a single person that indeed most people
have all of these things.

16
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,493
Um,

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:54,883
why?

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,960
Well,
what's a sensible thought about how to

19
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:58,561
deal with them?
Well,

20
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:01,320
first of all,
and this relates to what the proper

21
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:02,790
answer to the question,
and,

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,820
uh,
what's your identity is usually in a

23
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:09,120
context,
it's pretty clear which aspects of your

24
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:11,880
identity,
other ones that are relevant.

25
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,580
If I'm at a meeting of the American
Philosophical Association,

26
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:15,683
um,
my,

27
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,970
my identity as a philosopher is kind of
important,

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,610
but if I go to a meeting,
uh,

29
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,021
of,
uh,

30
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:21,670
of,
uh,

31
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,503
uh,
you know,

32
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,200
a church group,
it probably isn't.

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,160
And so I know,
uh,

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,360
I know without thinking about it,
uh,

35
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,820
often what the relevance is of different
dimensions of my identity.

36
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,970
So when people get into trouble with us
is because they think that one dimension

37
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:42,120
of identity makes a demand on them
that's inconsistent with the demand made

38
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,210
by some other dimension of their ideas.
I think there are sort of two

39
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,170
helpful guiding thoughts.
One is,

40
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,030
um,
morality is helpful here.

41
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,300
That is to say there are general
obligations.

42
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:05,510
We have two other people independent of
their identities and our identities.

43
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,640
We better make sure that we discharged
those.

44
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:10,850
First of all.
So if you find yourself being pulled

45
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:13,100
into dementia directions by your
identities,

46
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,650
if you find yourself being pulled in one
direction,

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,610
say as a Serb and in the other direction
as a Christian,

48
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,510
it might be helpful to remember that
you're a human being and that you have

49
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:25,170
obligations to other people,
uh,

50
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,340
that are not connected with whether
you're being with your Serb or

51
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,990
Christian.
So I,

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,850
that's one thing.
Morality helps morality,

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,250
which,
which defines what we owed to everybody,

54
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,590
irrespective of their identities.
At the second thing is that sometimes we

55
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:43,100
do have to make choices.
That's part of what it is to make human

56
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:43,770
life.

57
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,490
It's the,
it's the way in the balance.

58
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,010
Am I going to go here with my religious
identity or am I going to go here with

59
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:54,740
my racial identity in this particular
context?

60
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,730
Or am I going to try and find some way
here?

61
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,740
The two unthought of to bring them
together without that strong tension and

62
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:07,240
people are doing this all the time.
It can sound very difficult in theory,

63
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,480
but I know my model for this really was
my father.

64
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,580
My father wasn't a santee and a and a
patriot of the Santee,

65
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,200
a Ghanaian and a patriot of Ghana.
Uh,

66
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:20,260
he wrote an autobiography called the
autobiography of an African Patriot

67
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:22,360
because he was a Pan Africanist.
Um,

68
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,500
he was a devout methodist and very
active in his church and cared about his

69
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:29,350
church and he was a citizen of the
world.

70
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,620
He was ambassador to the UN for awhile
and he worked very much an international

71
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:33,840
affairs.

72
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,260
He cared about relations among nations.
Now you might think,

73
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:42,460
how can you be a loyal Isanti and a
loyal Ghanaian after all the Santa is a

74
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:44,140
kingdom in the middle of the Republic of
Ghana?

75
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,160
Well,
the answer is,

76
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,140
you know,
look at my father's life as it were.

77
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,350
And look at lots of lives.
People do this sort of thing all the

78
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:54,400
time.
You can be a loyal citizen of Texas and

79
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,190
a loyal American.
Occasionally they'll pull you in

80
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:59,590
different directions and then you have a
choice to make,

81
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,840
but much of the time,
you know,

82
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,020
being Texas texts and there's got to be
what matters for some purposes.

83
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:06,580
And being American is what matters for
others.

84
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,970
And when they do come into conflict,
you have many things to appeal to to

85
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:11,920
help you resolve the conflict,
including,

86
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:15,550
I think your own sense of the relative
weight in your own life,

87
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,230
which is up to you of your state
identity as opposed to your national

88
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:24,670
identity.
So you can't tell people you can't.

89
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,460
These are things that have people have
to figure out for themselves.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,470
Um,
because there is no morally correct,

91
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:34,900
uncertain though,
ethically pre given answer to the

92
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:37,570
question,
what's more important,

93
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,690
tax and or American,
what's more important,

94
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,770
um,
uh,

95
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,460
in a Christian or philosopher,
these things are not.

96
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,950
You have to figure it out for yourself.
I think all you can say to people in

97
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,690
trying to be helpful is that

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,590
I'm a,

99
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,010
you're often going to have people who
share one of these identities with you,

100
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:04,080
make demands of you on that basis that
you're entitled to resist in the name of

101
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:08,070
your more of morality and the,
and the name of a human human identity,

102
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,760
but also in the name of other identities
that you have and what you don't share

103
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:13,560
with them.
Everybody,

104
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,670
if you just,
um,

105
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,890
I worked at the other day that you
really need to have 32 properties,

106
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,000
uh,
to consider any 32 properties to elect

107
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:29,001
to have a set of bundles of properties
such as everybody in the world can have

108
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,870
a distinct and unique bundle.
The bundle the properties because two to

109
00:05:33,871 --> 00:05:36,900
the 32 is bigger than 6 billion or 6
billion of us.

110
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,690
Well,
I'm a.

111
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,610
So even in the smallest village,
right?

112
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,340
There are both men and women,
so all the other identities are inflect,

113
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,800
are potentially inflected by gender and
among the women,

114
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:56,270
some have more resources than others.
Some are married and some are married,

115
00:05:56,271 --> 00:06:00,120
some have children don't have children.
All of these affect how their lives

116
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,510
looked at them and how they get to make
the balance of these things in their

117
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:06,540
lives and the sort of the key thought of
the liberal tradition.

118
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,570
It goes back to comp,
goes back to Humboldt,

119
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,880
goes back to liberal,
slight mill.

120
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:14,900
In the 19th century,
the key thought is each human being has

121
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:17,930
to challenge face the challenge of
making this decision for herself.

122
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,830
You can take advice from other people,
you shouldn't take advice from other

123
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:24,920
people,
other people can tell you useful things,

124
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,160
but it's your responsibility in the end
to make a decision and you shouldn't

125
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:30,770
differ that responsibility to anyone
else.
