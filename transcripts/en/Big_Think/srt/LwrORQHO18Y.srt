1
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,220
With us.
I don't think we,

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,560
most military don't look at it that way.
We don't calculate that.

3
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:18,840
I might not come home.
That's,

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,270
that's like a factor that's never
calculated it into our decision making

5
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:24,430
process.
Our biggest thing is we might let the

6
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:28,270
guy down next to us.
So for us it's our training,

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,690
um,
to kind of go over there and execute our

8
00:00:31,691 --> 00:00:32,920
mission.
That's our biggest thing in the marine

9
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:33,820
corps.
Pushes that mission,

10
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:36,070
accomplishment,
mission accomplishment and troop

11
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:39,400
welfare.
And I think with that mindset we go in,

12
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:41,140
we're already pretty prepared for what's
going to go on,

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,260
you know,
for,

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,340
for me engaging the enemy or anything,
I always kind of thought I was doing

15
00:00:45,341 --> 00:00:48,820
what I was trained to do and I kind of
separated emotion from it.

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,000
And,
and I've,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,570
I've gotten better at it over the years.
Every deployment I went back,

18
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:53,770
I understood that in motion.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,550
His only weakness over here for me,
I must think objectively.

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,250
I don't,
a general maddis always says a phrase,

21
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:01,720
no better friend,
no worse enemy.

22
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,380
And I think it's like the best thing
because really it's,

23
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,320
it kind of explains what the fighting
man has to kind of do over there.

24
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:09,970
But it's very hard.
It's hard to go over there without

25
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:10,950
emotion.
It's,

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,550
you know,
after one of your friends gets hit by a

27
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:14,530
roadside bomb,
it's hard not to be pissed,

28
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:15,850
but the truth is you got to realize,
hey,

29
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:18,220
this is the nature of the beast.
I got to drive on.

30
00:01:18,221 --> 00:01:20,740
I'm not going to take it out on other
Iraqis that aren't involved,

31
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,053
you know.

32
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,920
Um,
I got hit by a rocket pro grenade and

33
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,210
April seven,
2004,

34
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:32,150
nine and the initial push into Falucia,
um,

35
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,000
for me,
we got,

36
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:36,500
we got slammed right going into an
ambush and,

37
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:38,000
uh,
we were the point vehicle.

38
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,380
It actually,
well,

39
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,420
I blew off my assistant team leader at
both his hands,

40
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:42,254
Eddie,
right?

41
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,880
Um,
it broke my arm,

42
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:47,570
blew up my trigger finger and did a it
wounded everyone else in my vehicle.

43
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,561
Uh,
what we did,

44
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:51,230
we pushed out of the kill zone and
actually got stuck in a secondary kill

45
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:52,150
zone,
uh,

46
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,620
where we were surrounded by about 26
guys.

47
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,513
And,
uh,

48
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,960
we had to do medical aid to ourselves,
but I put a tourniquet on and uh,

49
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,050
one of my young Lance Corporal Lance
Corporal Meson actually tourniqueted um,

50
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,970
up Eddie.
But uh,

51
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,760
for us it was actually kind of funny
cause this is like that Marine Corps

52
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,500
humor that you see throughout the
series.

53
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,070
And he writes in the backseat cracking
jokes and the guy has no hands.

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,680
And uh,
for me it's like calm breeds calm.

55
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:16,790
So I'm like,
Shit,

56
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,330
if this guy is laughing about this,
you know,

57
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,860
how can I be worried?
I'm definitely not as bad as he is.

58
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,130
And he actually made a bad situation
kind of somewhat entertaining.

59
00:02:25,131 --> 00:02:28,830
And then we just went back and we just
executed what we trained for cause and

60
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,290
high,
high levels of stress.

61
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,390
You always resort back to your last
highest level of training.

62
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,370
For me,
this is my third combat tour.

63
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:37,340
So it wasn't like I was worried.
I just,

64
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,960
I just kind of,
everything was muscle memory.

65
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,850
I did whatever we had to do to survive
it.

66
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,450
We got back out of the kill zone and,
uh,

67
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,830
probably about an hour and a half,
two hours later we were metal backed out

68
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:46,664
of there.

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,780
I always kind of promised that I was
gonna I was gonna make things right for

70
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:54,120
Eddie.
I just Kinda,

71
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,740
you know,
after seeing him in the hospital that

72
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:58,540
actually brought me to tears to him in
Icu.

73
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,430
It's hard.
I don't,

74
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,051
you know,
it's hard to say.

75
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:05,420
I don't want to say I wanted to go kill
a bunch of people to get back,

76
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,750
you know,
revenge because you know,

77
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,030
then again,
that's kind of,

78
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,010
you know,
using my emotion part.

79
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:13,940
But I wanted to,
I wanted to make it feel like that we

80
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:16,460
were wounded that day for something.
You know,

81
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:18,600
it wasn't for nothing.
I wanted to get back there and,

82
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:22,580
and try and fix the problems Iraq had.
And if that meant fight him and fight if

83
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:25,600
that man fix the infrastructure or
worked with the local Iraqis,

84
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,820
do whatever I can,
whatever's in my power to make that

85
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:29,600
place better.

86
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,250
And I,
I learned a lot because my fourth and

87
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:33,830
fifth tours are totally different than
what you see in generation kill.

88
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,840
Um,
a lot of what I did is actually live

89
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,410
with the Iraqis,
um,

90
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,430
now to 24 man platoon and we,
we created kind of an atmosphere where

91
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,320
they can be safe or they're around.
We learned off them,

92
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:46,910
we learned everything from how to cook.
Uh,

93
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,540
there,
there were flatbread are Hovis to how to

94
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:54,260
hook up a Italian porn on their tvs to
teaching them how to patrol.

95
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,270
Um,
you know,

96
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:58,040
and,
and working with these people closely

97
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,020
and try and get rid of everything from
the criminal annulment.

98
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,090
That's,
that's like running loose in Iraq to

99
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:05,800
work with the terrorist and uh,
the other elements that are there cause

100
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,300
it's very complex and I learned so much
more in my,

101
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:10,760
my fourth and fifth tour then you then I
could ever imagine,

102
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:14,060
I mean I kind of look back at my first
multiple tours and it's like,

103
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:15,770
wow,
if I knew what I knew now,

104
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,420
you know,
we could have done such a better job

105
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:18,254
back then.

106
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,640
We did it on this place called pork chop
island is like a,

107
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:26,400
I think in the history of the world.
I don't think anyone's been injured on

108
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:27,810
that island.
But,

109
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:29,250
uh,
for me it's like getting back on the

110
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:32,580
horse and I was actually paranoid and
actually kind of how well it must be.

111
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:33,730
What captain America fell in.
Oh,

112
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,490
I have one.
I was very paranoid because I was

113
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:38,220
calculating and everything,
every comment I've seen in the past,

114
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,500
like possible ambushes that can go down
and everything.

115
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:43,140
And my mind was just racing and,
uh,

116
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,221
and I was like,
man,

117
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:45,990
why,
why did I come back here?

118
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,183
And,
um,

119
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,460
I think after I got over it,
it was just like one day of extreme

120
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:52,290
paranoia for some reason.
But,

121
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,250
uh,
after that,

122
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,910
I went back to just push an emotion to
the side and doing my job.

123
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,580
And I had no.
