1
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,640
I always felt forster was overrated
frankly.

2
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,910
Um,
to take an obvious example.

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,850
Never really got it.
Uh,

4
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,100
when people go on and on about Graham
Greene,

5
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,840
especially his important books like end
of the affair,

6
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,210
I get puzzled by.
Shouldn't be.

7
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:38,330
I mean there's nothing wrong with green
and there's nothing wrong with forrester

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,790
either.
I just feel like

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,700
what's all the fuss about?
What is all the fuss about?

10
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,350
Damned if I know frankly.
Um,

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,990
I think there is a,
there are,

12
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,030
there must be American writers.
Well Dave Wallace I think is one of them

13
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:06,540
and probably George Saunders is another
who I don't think the Brits get it all.

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,140
I think they're just like,
why do people or why this is so.

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,330
This is so purell oil.
It's so easy.

16
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:15,570
It's like I don't know what they're
thinking or this is so bratty.

17
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:18,780
It's so annoying.
Or it's so broad or whatever they're

18
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:20,910
saying.
I think there's a category of American

19
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:24,090
fiction that just doesn't cross the
ocean so well.

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,430
And I think that I'm talking about a
strain of British fiction writing

21
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,630
a not inconsiderable strain of British
fiction writing that I don't that some

22
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:37,464
people

23
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,130
to some people,
this is what a novel is.

24
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,500
It's an enforced or novel or a Graham
Greene novel.

25
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:49,501
They're living practitioners in England
producing novels that also today seem

26
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:51,820
like,
well,

27
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,730
this is what a real novelist is and this
is what a real novel is.

28
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,090
Um,
and for some of us in America,

29
00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:01,780
you're just like say that's not even a
novelist hardly.

30
00:02:01,781 --> 00:02:03,990
That's sort of a,
it's,

31
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,570
it's an,
it's an a near perfect replica of a

32
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:08,800
novel.
It's,

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,720
um,
so it's a taste thing.

34
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,780
Uh,
I think there's a kind of well made

35
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,210
product that,
that forster pioneered and represents,

36
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,230
um,
that engendered a great many very well

37
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:32,911
made novels in England in the 20th
century that either think is like what

38
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:37,630
an novel should be,
or else you just throw up your hand.
