1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,360
My mother raised us on real food and she
was a fan of Adele Davis who was the

2
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:19,350
pioneering slightly out of the
mainstream nutritionist,

3
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,930
but a lay woman,
right.

4
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:23,240
And so then,
then a lot of people attacked her for

5
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:24,400
not knowing enough,
uh,

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,630
who came out of California,
um,

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,050
in the sixties and seventies.
She had a pretty big following and Adele

8
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,500
Davis had very simple principles,
all of which have been pretty much born

9
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,300
out by the,
by the subsequent science,

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,720
wholefood b vitamins,
real meat,

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,790
real milk,
um,

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,110
traditional fats.
She has a few clunkers that don't

13
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,450
survive the test of time,
which you come across in her books.

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,040
But on the whole,
everything,

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,720
everything she said prove to be true.
And so my mother raised us on whole

16
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:54,350
wheat bread and,
uh,

17
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:56,630
the proverbial black strap,
molasses.

18
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,510
We made granola once a week.
The children had,

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,460
uh,
an assignment to make granola.

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,550
Um,
we also ate all the meats.

21
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:07,130
It was not a Vegan hit becoming our
little farm.

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,370
Um,
so we had very traditional simple

23
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:11,840
American meals,
like fried chicken,

24
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,230
meatloaf.
Um,

25
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,750
I remember,
uh,

26
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,390
uh,
food I regard as one of our super frugal

27
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:20,060
meals was macaroni with tuna and cream
sauce,

28
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,490
which I loved.
Um,

29
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,730
my mother used to dip her toast in the
bacon fat and nothing was off limits,

30
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,280
um,
except white sugar and white flour.

31
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,900
Those would have been my mother's
standards.

32
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:35,630
And she used to say,
no matter how little money we have will

33
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:38,930
always have real maple syrup,
real olive oil and real butter.

34
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,550
We also had a cow and chickens.
And in addition to the vegetables,

35
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:46,880
we were growing our vegetable farm.
So we drank raw milk.

36
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,070
We didn't make any cheese or dairy
products.

37
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,840
Um,
that would have been more homesteady

38
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:53,240
than we were.
And we were really busy as commercial

39
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:56,120
vegetable farmers,
but we did have fresh eggs and fresh

40
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:59,300
milk.
And then what we couldn't raise

41
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:02,450
ourselves,
we bought or bartered for the farmer's

42
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:04,160
markets.
And in the dead of winter,

43
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:05,480
we shopped at the supermarkets.

44
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,630
My concept of real food was grounded in
my mother's lessons for us.

45
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,870
Um,
uh,

46
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,170
which were that it should be whole,
it should be traditional.

47
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,450
It should be simple,
shouldn't be processed,

48
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,210
a small number of ingredients.
Um,

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,100
and then I sort of went off track and,
uh,

50
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:31,460
in my teens and 20s,
became a Vegan and a vegetarian and

51
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:35,180
tried to low fat diets and low saturated
fat diets and low cholesterol diets.

52
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,050
And,
um,

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,740
the,
and,

54
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,090
and the reason I did that is it was not
so much their thumb in the face of my

55
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:43,390
mother,
although perhaps we're,

56
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:46,670
we're all acting against our parents in
some ways.

57
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,880
Um,
but more because it was,

58
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,820
um,
the conventional wisdom of the time in

59
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,680
the late eighties and the early 1990s
that less fat was good,

60
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,400
less saturated fat,
good less animal fat,

61
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:03,130
less cholesterol,
more plant foods.

62
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,500
So I assumed that if all those things
were true,

63
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:06,510
that,
um,

64
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,990
a nonfat Vegan diet was probably the
best of all.

65
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,510
Um,
and,

66
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,260
and that's what I tried and,
uh,

67
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,260
things went,
went along fine.

68
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:20,230
No one would have called me sick.
Um,

69
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,640
but on Vegan and low fat diets,
in fact,

70
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:27,850
my health suffered and I was 25 pounds
heavier than I am now.

71
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,600
And I had a host of minor minor
complaints,

72
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,970
um,
and,

73
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,370
and no one really would have ever called
me ill or,

74
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,510
or certainly they wouldn't have
suspected my perfect diet because I was

75
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,720
not a junk food vegan or vegetarian.
I had brown rice and beans.

76
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,190
I,
olive oil,

77
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,500
light fruits and vegetables.
Um,

78
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,110
I just didn't eat,
um,

79
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,520
many traditional foods.
How,

80
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,760
how I now understand it.
So what brought me back to real food,

81
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,110
um,
was,

82
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,230
was a wonderful serendipity.
I was living in London and I had started

83
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:07,030
the first American style farmer's
markets in London in 1999 and when I

84
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:09,460
grew up in the,
in the Washington dc area,

85
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:12,670
at the farmer's markets,
there were the vegetable people like us

86
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,750
and the fruit guys.

87
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,340
And then there was the plant lady and
the honey man and the baker at farmers

88
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,920
markets.
When I started my first little farmer's

89
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:25,000
market in London,
I had farmers even at my first little

90
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:30,001
market with only 16 producers selling
grass fed and pastured beef and lamb and

91
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:35,020
pork and chicken.
They were selling raw milk cheeses and

92
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:39,820
cream and um,
and sausages and meat pies.

93
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,590
And fish and all sorts of wonderful
things.

94
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,950
So then I got a book contract and that
was to write the farmers' market

95
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,550
cookbook.
And I had just been dabbling around with

96
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,490
eggs and with fish.
And I was no longer Vegan and no longer

97
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,080
a vegetarian,
but I wasn't eating.

98
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,380
I was not yet a carnivore or an omnivore
even.

99
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,840
And so I didn't want to write a
vegetarian or even a fish and eggs

100
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:06,730
farmers' market cookbook.
I felt I had to honor all the food

101
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:07,930
producers at the markets.

102
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,990
And we'll the eaters as well.
So I,

103
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,370
I looked around and I saw that the,
the farmers have these wonderful

104
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:16,640
traditional foods,
the meat,

105
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,340
eggs,
dairy,

106
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,910
the fats,
um,

107
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,330
we're healthy and happy people and seem
to enjoy their food.

108
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:24,430
And,
and the eaters were healthy and happy

109
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,620
people and to certainly enjoyed all
those foods.

110
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,580
And I began to wonder whether I
shouldn't try these foods.

111
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,760
So for my cookbook,
I tried every food at our markets and

112
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,400
wrote recipes and ate all the recipes.
And it was along the way that I slowly

113
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:44,560
became a,
an omnivore again.

114
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,490
Um,
and with each food I ate with each fat,

115
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:50,680
with each rich thing,
with each red meat,

116
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,820
with each forbidden and taboo thing.
Would g w with each item that the

117
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,650
cardiologists were banning,
um,

118
00:05:57,651 --> 00:06:01,910
in the u s and in Britain as well,
my health improved quite dramatically.

119
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,210
I lost 25 pounds.
I didn't have to exercise as much.

120
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,100
I used to run six miles,
six,

121
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,640
six times a week.
I'd colds and flu and flu season.

122
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,510
My nails and hair and skin were dry.
My digestion was terrible.

123
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,660
All of those problems melted away.
When,

124
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,990
when I became an element of Oregon.
