00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,660
There's a great saying that wikipedia
works really well in practice,

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:08,661
just not in theory,
and that is true wikipedia success is so

3
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:13,080
singular,
so spectacular that figuring out whether

4
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:16,860
it's a model for anything other than
Wikipedia is a puzzle that even the

5
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:20,220
folks behind Wikipedia have faced as
they've tried to do wiki search,

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,000
Wiki news and [inaudible] Harry at
different times,

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,510
but the idea of having a scheme where
the day to day governance,

8
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:33,150
the day to day edits,
whether done for substance to improve

9
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:37,500
the truth level of an article in the
view of the editor or done for process,

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,130
oh,
that edit shouldn't have been made a

11
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:40,110
breaks.
The following rule,

12
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:44,760
I'm going to revert it to have the
people doing that be members of the

13
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:49,761
public at large is an extraordinary
devolution of responsibility out to

14
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:57,441
people who are in one way or another
implicitly or explicitly sort of taking

15
00:00:57,781 --> 00:01:02,781
an oath to subscribe to the principles
behind Wikipedia of neutrality,

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,460
of fairness,
of learning,

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,820
kind of the values of the enlightenment
and cannot survive itself over the long

18
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:11,250
haul.

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,830
I don't know.
As you get more and more importance

20
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:17,520
attached to Wikipedia,
more and more places that draw from

21
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:22,521
wikipedia as a source of data,
whether it's something like the Wolfram

22
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,630
Alpha knowledge engine or google to
assemble basic facts for results in a

23
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:30,390
search,
there may be more and more reason for

24
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:35,391
entities to want to gain the results.
If you could just put yourself in the

25
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,740
Guinness Book of World Records for
having the longest beard or something

26
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:39,390
and you don't actually have to grow
anything,

27
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:39,841
it's like,
well,

28
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:41,370
why not?
I'll vote myself rich.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,690
These are problems that wikepedia has
had to deal with so far,

30
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,650
relatively successfully.
And uh,

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,360
there's a level of humility that I think
it has to maintain in order to recognize

32
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:56,820
new problems,
to recognize where there might be

33
00:01:56,821 --> 00:02:01,821
structural forms of bias or
discrimination going on and to be able

34
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:08,451
to endure the more targeted intentional
attempts to basically poison the well of

35
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:14,670
truth that wikipedia at least aspires to
be.

36
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,290
What would I propose as a longer term
way of shoring it up?

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,030
I think we should solve a problem with a
problem we haven't really figured out,

38
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,910
uh,
in the early 21st century,

39
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,830
what to do with kids who are in school
for hours at a time,

40
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,860
every day sort of warehoused in daycare.
I think it would be wonderful to make as

41
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:40,410
part of the curriculum from say sixth
grade onward,

42
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,860
part of your task and it will be graded
on,

43
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,220
is to edit and make the case for your
edits to an article on a service like

44
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,210
wikipedia.
And then we'll have new ranks of people

45
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,390
being supervised by teachers who are
working on the articles and on the

46
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:04,630
product.
And that may be even we'll apprentice to

47
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:08,590
the norms by which you have an argument
over what is true and what isn't.

48
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,830
And maybe some of them will choose to
continue on his wikipedia guns,

49
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,470
uh,
even after the assignment is over.

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,500
So to me,
if I think of an advanced civics class,

51
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,340
it's great to learn that there are three
branches of government and you know,

52
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,750
x vote gets you a veto,
but a overrides a veto.

53
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,180
But having the civics of a collective
hallucination like wikipedia also be

54
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:33,640
part of the curriculum,
I think would be valuable.
