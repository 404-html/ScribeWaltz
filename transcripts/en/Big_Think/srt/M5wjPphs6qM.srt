1
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,940
I don't think that is being overly
optimistic or if it is,

2
00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:16,900
I'm,
I'm right there.

3
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:21,220
And I think a lot of other people who
care about creativity,

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,280
creativity,
not just for the sake of art itself,

5
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:27,190
but creativity as a way of looking at
problems,

6
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:30,730
looking at human beings,
looking at the world from a number of

7
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,440
different angles.
At the same time,

8
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,030
I think that what we've seen from a lot
of Obama's political utterances that I

9
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:41,230
think is very resonant with people who
have sort of chosen the creative life

10
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:44,950
and who find inspiration for the
creative life is that there's not one

11
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:48,190
answer.
Many things are sometimes true at once.

12
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,230
You can be in the midst of contradiction
and not have that be a stopping point,

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,170
but rather be a weigh station on the
road forward.

14
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,470
We've heard a lot of that kind of
language from him and I think that

15
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:04,330
that's something certainly that great
literature tries to show us as well.

16
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,500
Um,
that,

17
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,700
you know,
for example,

18
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:11,701
to be American is not one thing to be
American is multi experiential,

19
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,690
multilingual.
Um,

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,190
it is,
it is many,

21
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:17,470
many,
many different aspects of the human

22
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:20,170
experience.
And that's really part of what makes

23
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:23,230
this,
in my opinion and incredibly interesting

24
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,440
country with a very,
very vibrant arts scene.

25
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,850
Uh,
it is that essence that is not one

26
00:01:30,851 --> 00:01:31,990
thing.
And,

27
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:32,980
uh,
so I think that,

28
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:35,500
that,
that comfort with contradiction is

29
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:37,690
something that we've seen from the
president as well.

30
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,680
So I see that as,
you know,

31
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,810
fertile ground for the area.
