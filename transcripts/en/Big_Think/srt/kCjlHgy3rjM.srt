1
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,503
Oh,
I think so.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,940
Yeah.
I don't think it's any time soon.

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,260
I think we have to first be treated
equally within society.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,510
Uh,
and once we are treated equally within

5
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:19,850
society,
we then have an opportunity for

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,610
[inaudible] to participate more fully.
You think of it this way,

7
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:27,110
there's over 500,000 elected official
positions in the United States of

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,050
America,
500,000 from local city council to water

9
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:31,670
district and president of the United
States.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,510
There's less than 300 who are openly gay
or lesbian,

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,550
bisexual,
or transgender.

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,010
So that's a long way to go in terms of
represent elected representation of a

13
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:47,660
community that is certainly much larger
than its elected representation is

14
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,460
within that community.
Um,

15
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:51,530
so we have a ways to go in that respect,
but I,

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,090
I,
I think that day will come.
