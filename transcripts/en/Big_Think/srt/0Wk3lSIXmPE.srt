1
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,230
Sensory deprivation is where we put 
people in dark soundproof rooms or water

2
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:17,700
tanks.
People are becoming aware that we needed

3
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,890
sensation,
stimulation,

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,840
variation,
stimulation,

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,090
all of us as much as we need to,
a float in the water and so forth.

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,280
The basic needs and deprivation of this 
kind of stimulation,

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,230
uh,
lead to,

8
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:35,430
uh,
some,

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,350
uh,
very uncomfortable states.

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,330
Uh,
so we,

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,703
we asked is there a personality trait 
that some people need more stimulation 

12
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,760
or more variety or intensity of 
stimulation than others.

13
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,780
And that's when we developed our first 
sensation seeking scale.

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,680
And subsequently that expanded became 
the main focus of my research is the,

15
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,394
uh,
we were surprised by how many things 

16
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,410
were affected by this trait sensation 
seeking.

17
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,560
And then we got interested in the 
biological basis.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,390
It's genetic and biological basis.
And here again,

19
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,224
we had some very interesting findings 
pointed to the fact that this is a very 

20
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,470
fundamental trait with biological roots.

21
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,023
Well,
this is determined from twin studies 

22
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:31,850
called biometrics,
have a behavioral genetics actually.

23
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,500
Uh,
and,

24
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:36,350
uh,
using these twin studies,

25
00:01:36,351 --> 00:01:41,351
we initially found that roughly 60 
percent heritability heritability is the

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,170
proportion of the variance trait that's 
determined by genetics.

27
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:49,843
And we discovered there was 60 percent,
which is very high for personality 

28
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:53,594
trait,
which generally run between 30 and 50 

29
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,074
percent.
So 60 percent is high for a personality 

30
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:00,741
trait.
Well,

31
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:03,620
it's higher for intelligence and some 
other traits.

32
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,610
So a little more recently,
uh,

33
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,750
oh,
this was established,

34
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:13,340
not only using twins are raised 
together,

35
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,174
but twins raised apart showing that it 
wasn't due to the fact of sharing a 

36
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,004
stimulating environment.
Let's say there was an environmental 

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,370
aspect of this,
of the remaining 40 percent,

38
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,700
some of those error of measurement,
but some of it is due to environment,

39
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,200
but it's not the shared where we go the 
shared environment shared in the family.

40
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,210
It's due to the,
uh,

41
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,810
a non shared environment,
which means your friends,

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,913
peers,
your unique life experiences that you 

43
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:42,464
have the other people in your family,
you don't share with other people in 

44
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:45,734
your family.

45
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,353
We can surmise that the sense of 
particular gene has been found to be 

46
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:56,390
related to sensation seeking a dope,
mean,

47
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,460
receptive Jane,
so that it's been there a long time.

48
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,850
Well,
actually they estimate that it's not old

49
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:04,571
evolution,
you know,

50
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:07,330
maybe 50,000,
100,000

51
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:09,870
years old in our species,
uh,

52
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,253
this particular Jane,
but there may be other genes that are 

53
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:15,960
older even,
but you see this another,

54
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,883
the point is you see what we might call 
sensation sick analogs of sensation 

55
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:23,200
seeking behavior and other species.
In fact,

56
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:28,201
a lot of my work has compared sensation 
seeking a expressions exploration,

57
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,403
novel approach,
the novelty and other species with the 

58
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,374
same explored this,
that the extent that they have the same 

59
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,440
biological roots and Helen's and then 
other species.

60
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,250
So in that sense,
we look at evolution.

61
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:45,084
We have a modern test of evolution when 
you can find something that exists in 

62
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:52,750
humans and earlier species,
particularly primates,

63
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,693
but also even in rats when you can find 
this and it's linked to the same 

64
00:03:58,331 --> 00:03:59,164
biological indicators in both species,
in both humans and other animals that 

65
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:07,930
indicates that has a revolutionary 
history.

66
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,660
Rather,
it's more than a merely analogy,

67
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:12,550
oh,
this looks like what we do,

68
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,653
but it's more than that.
It's that the fact that it looks like 

69
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,400
sensation seeking and has the same 
biological roots,

70
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,720
I would say the,
uh,

71
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,350
the age differences are somewhat larger 
if you're looking at the extremes.

72
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,510
No,
I would say like it like about 60,

73
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,403
65.
A male would have half the sensation 

74
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:40,660
seeking store that he had when he was in
his late teens,

75
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,930
early twenties.
So that's pretty much of a decline.

76
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,860
Uh,
the male female differences are constant

77
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:49,640
across age,
uh,

78
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,853
but,
uh,

79
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,943
uh,
perhaps not as large as when we talk 

80
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:56,420
about sex differences,
you know,

81
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,254
and traits.
We're always talking about a lot of 

82
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,120
overlap for you about population 
differences.

83
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,860
So people always say,
I know someone who is a female,

84
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:07,660
but it's very high sensation seeking.
Of course,

85
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,480
you know,
there's variation within both genders.

86
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,630
Just the overall population differences 
different.
