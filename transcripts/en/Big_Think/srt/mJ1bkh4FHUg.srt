1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,700
For me at least,
I don't really take anything for granted

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,520
is the way that I feel.
Because you see,

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,570
you see multiple ways of living,
you see your,

4
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:18,060
your express.
I think what happens here is that people

5
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:22,050
get so used to this idea of,
of,

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,800
of America as a place where anything and
everything should happen.

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,350
And you know,
where as Americans,

8
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:31,180
I think we're a very entitled bunch or
we,

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,070
you know,
and I think that having seen that,

10
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:38,190
that's not the case around the world.
You're very aware of that.

11
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:40,380
And I think everything here then takes
on a new meaning.

12
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:42,210
It's one that's not to say that,
that,

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,290
that,
that,

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:43,861
I mean like,
you know,

15
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,600
when you say something like that,
people can say,

16
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:47,250
oh well you think you're better than
everyone else.

17
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:48,090
That's not it at all.
I mean,

18
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,950
I think everybody's still falls into
that.

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,740
And I would say that I'm just as
entitled,

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,960
I feel just as entitled and probably
behave just as entitled as the next

21
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:59,550
American as the next person here.
I think at the same time having the

22
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:00,960
ability to step out,
right,

23
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:04,170
having the ability to be in another
place and see how people perceive you as

24
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:08,520
an American and then not just see,
but also actively participate in that

25
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:11,400
perception of Americans really is a self
check.

26
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:14,850
It's a way of looking at your,
your behavior as a member of this

27
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:17,010
particular society or this particular
culture.

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,440
And I think it leads to,
for me at least,

29
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:21,600
I feel like my life has completely
enriched.

30
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:23,430
I mean,
being Nigerian obviously are being a

31
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:25,770
Nigerian American also means that I'm a
black American,

32
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:28,200
which is also another set of
perspectives.

33
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:31,740
I mean obviously given the history that
black Americans have in this society,

34
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:34,320
it's different for me because I'm not,
you know,

35
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:36,480
I'm not,
my family doesn't go generations deep

36
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:38,700
here,
but you still experience the same things

37
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:40,170
and you still have that,
that,

38
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,950
that outlook and you still have that way
of seeing how things are put together in

39
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:44,550
this society.

40
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,630
And I think,
you know,

41
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:46,530
having,
again,

42
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:47,364
being in,
in,

43
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,850
in a weird way also not really being in
because you're,

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,130
you're part of this,
of,

45
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,970
of your black American,
right?

46
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:56,040
I am a black American,
but at the same time it's a different

47
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:56,874
version,
right?

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,120
And it's a multiple,
it's a different version.

49
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,530
It,
it allows,

50
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,550
I think having those different versions
of being a black American allows

51
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:07,470
multiple perspectives and,
you know,

52
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:10,320
different analysis of what being a black
American meetings.

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,910
I think all too often the society has to
monolithic definition of what a black

54
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:16,410
American is.
And I think having,

55
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,710
you know,
being a Nigerian man,

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,360
American being black,
being African adds to that definition,

57
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,650
at least in my own case.
Right?

58
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:24,860
And I think it helps,
uh,

59
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,700
in the largest sense if,
you know,

60
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:31,050
for all the people who are black
Americans from this part of the country,

61
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,000
from that part of the country,
if you are going to be an American,

62
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:35,040
if you're Nigerian American,
if you're Caribbean American,

63
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,940
to add nuanced and structure to that
definition of black American.

64
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,630
Um,
and so allow people to see that it's not

65
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:44,610
just one thing.
It's not just one culture,

66
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:47,760
that it's a multiplicity of cultures and
that's important both for,

67
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,240
for the recognition of that set of
people as full citizens and also for

68
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:54,210
the,
for the,

69
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,230
for the country as a whole.
