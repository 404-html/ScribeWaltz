1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,810
Most amazing things happen when you say
yes to God.

2
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,930
The most unexpected things happen when
you say yes to God.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,640
Somebody asked me if I could boil down
all of my Christian faith into one word,

4
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,190
and that word for me is,
I thought about it was the word

5
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:25,320
surrender or just in really simple
terms,

6
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:26,880
it's,
it's saying yes to God.

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,800
It's saying that,
um,

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,700
I believe God that you probably know
what's best from our life for my life,

9
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:35,940
more than I do.
And I'm willing to trust you with my

10
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:40,080
life and I'm willing to go along with
what I understand to be your plans for

11
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,230
my life.
And in so doing it,

12
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:45,990
it causes you to have to say no to
yourself.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,980
Because honestly what gets in my way
every day is myself.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,940
I call it in the book the Kingdom of me,
that to be really honest,

15
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:58,941
the person I love the most is myself and
that I like most people and eager to

16
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:00,780
make the world revolve around me.

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,480
I want my comfort,
my convenience.

18
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,550
I want you to see life from my point of
view.

19
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:09,000
I want you to think I'm right.
I want you to like the way I do things.

20
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,250
So it's we're pretty self centered
creatures,

21
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:15,120
all of us.
And to say yes to God means in many ways

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,730
saying no to myself.
For instance,

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,350
in I'm a real practical way that I can
think of that is in,

24
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,690
in a marriage.
Um,

25
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,830
my husband and I both are self centered
people.

26
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:28,290
We are,
we love ourselves more than even we love

27
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:32,190
each other unfortunately.
And sometimes in an argument or a

28
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:35,970
potential argument,
I will want him to look at life through

29
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,670
my set of lenses.
I want him to see a situation from my

30
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:41,130
point of view.
And if he doesn't,

31
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,860
it's really easy to get offended,
to get wounded,

32
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:45,300
to get hurt,
to get bitter,

33
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,440
to surrender to God is to take that same
kind of analogy that I'm saying in

34
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:53,610
marriage of saying to my husband,
I can either fight for all my ways,

35
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:54,990
my thoughts,
my agenda,

36
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,630
my dreams,
and kind of run over his,

37
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:01,680
or I can many times kind of just go
along with his will on a,

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,970
on a bigger scale.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,720
That's what it means to say yes to God.
There is my way of doing things,

40
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,720
which frequently involves jealousy,
you know,

41
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:11,100
bitterness,
anger,

42
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,670
greed.
All of those things are not God's ways.

43
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,260
Those don't,
those don't come from God.

44
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,560
So when I'm saying Yes to God,
I'm choosing his way,

45
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:23,010
I'm choosing a response that's really
more like something he would choose,

46
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:24,870
which would be love,
compassion,

47
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,520
mercy,
grace,

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,160
tenderness,
giving people second chances.

49
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,430
Those are all the things that come more
from a heart of God.

50
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:34,020
Then the ones that come from my heart.
