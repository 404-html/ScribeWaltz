1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,830
We have a responsibility as a
professional,

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,260
the timeline of the professional,
what's happening in the profession,

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,120
who has made a contribution and learn
from those things to free yourself to

4
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:26,261
become your own voice.
When I was building this house in North

5
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,800
Sea,
which were making the documentary of,

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,160
and I work with Peter Shelton,
my partner and my dear friend from

7
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:37,850
college read Morrison,
I realized there's the building went up.

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,940
I could kind of see the
intellectual collage of who I was as

9
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:50,270
pieces of the building stood at various
stages.

10
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,380
I could feel the ghost of Loucon.
When I looked at the poured concrete,

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,960
when I saw some of the glass details,
I kept thinking of the architects

12
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:02,450
collaborative in Boston.
When I looked at

13
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:09,490
some of the woodworking on the cladding,
I thought of Ed Barnes or Cert,

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,070
and then the way the stair was
conceived,

15
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,250
I thought of court was the a
and I started to realize that pieces of

16
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:24,980
who we are are often pieces of who we've
looked and studied,

17
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,020
but it's our responsibility to then
become ourselves.

18
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,840
So how do you take that where you can
almost dissect your own psyche and the

19
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:40,400
layers of building is such an
interesting tapestry of those pieces of

20
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:45,401
who you are and then hopefully when they
come together they become you,

21
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,480
but you owe to who you've become.
And then I realized when that building

22
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,820
was done,
because I love the archeology of great

23
00:01:58,821 --> 00:02:01,340
people in my profession,
meaning whether it's their drawings,

24
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:02,660
their furniture,
their lighting

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,280
that kind of designed democracy emerged,
which is such an American idea

26
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,820
that we embrace many cultures and we
celebrate them and we celebrate ideas.

27
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,390
So the building was a kind of
international amalgam of people and

28
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:24,980
things that as Americans,
we're very open to and that I had

29
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:29,090
actually collected the archeology of
those people.

30
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,480
And as those things occupied the
building,

31
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,500
I realized that there archeology
informed the building that they inhabit.
