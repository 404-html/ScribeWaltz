1
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,200
What we're thinking about things we're
already seeing.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,210
Um,
uh,

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,610
warm air holds more water vapor than
cold.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,540
Um,
the atmosphere is about 5% more moisture

5
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:19,680
in it then it had 40 years ago,
which is an astonishingly large change

6
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:22,410
in a basic physical parameter.
Uh,

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,090
that means that we're seeing huge
increases in the amount of day and

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,590
downpour and flood.
There's a record rainfall and flood

9
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:33,870
event someplace around the world almost
every week.

10
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:36,540
Now,
the hundred year storm comes to many

11
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,850
places every three or four years.
Uh,

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,520
it's taking a great toll on
infrastructure,

13
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:43,160
on human life.
You know,

14
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:45,600
if this spring we watched,
uh,

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,110
hundreds of people killed in Rio,
in the middle of Rio de Janeiro in mud

16
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:54,300
slides after the largest rainstorms
they'd ever recorded in that city.

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,540
Um,
uh,

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,340
look at the chemistry of seawater.
I mean,

19
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:02,760
the ocean is the,
our metaphor for vastness on this

20
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,910
planet,
but that hasn't stopped it from changing

21
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:07,260
in profound ways.

22
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,470
See waters 30% more acidic and it was 40
or 50 years ago because the oceans are

23
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:15,480
absorbing so much carbon from the
atmosphere.

24
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,130
Everything frozen on earth is melting.
Glaciers are melting with great

25
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:21,210
rapidity,
uh,

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,480
all over the planet.
Some of them have disappeared in the

27
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:26,310
western us,
in the Andes.

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,870
Um,
um,

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,080
you can go on for many days just listing
the effects we've already seen.

30
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,040
If we don't do things quickly,
the effects that are coming as the

31
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:41,700
temperature gets hotter and hotter will
be even more dramatic.

32
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,780
Uh,
the latest studies indicate that by the

33
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:50,340
mid to latter part of the century,
we could be seeing grain yields for corn

34
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:53,550
and soybean and wheat fall 20,
30,

35
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:55,450
40%.
Um,

36
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,950
that would be trouble of a,
uh,

37
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:04,350
a all encompassing sword,
new planet.

38
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,520
We need new habits,
new ways of going about things.

39
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,050
The biggest habit on our planet at the
moment is a kind of,

40
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,960
uh,
addiction to economic growth and to the

41
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:21,440
idea that growth will solve every
problem that we face.

42
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,200
Um,
that's a habit we're going to have to

43
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:26,960
habit of mind really,
that we're going to have to get out of.

44
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,300
Uh,
we've reached those limits to growth

45
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:33,140
that people started talking about it in
the 1970s when you melt the Arctic,

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,900
that's a pretty good sign that you've
gone too far.

47
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,860
And so we're going to need to figure out
instead how to build a world that is

48
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,720
stable,
secure,

49
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,520
kinda hunker down that's built for,
uh,

50
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,990
uh,
built for endurance,

51
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:53,060
not for speed,
a con.

52
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,110
I think that means more and more than
our economies will need to become more

53
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:59,150
localized,
less sprawling,

54
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,910
uh,
less vulnerable,

55
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,050
more resilient.
We can see that starting slowly to

56
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:08,050
happen.
The number of farms in the United States

57
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,640
increased last five years for the first
time in a century and a half.

58
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,960
And it's because there's this local food
movement that's building up that kind of

59
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:18,910
resilience in place after place.
