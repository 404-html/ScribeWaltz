1
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,340
Change also in the,
in the,

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,350
in the critical arena of food journalism
when I was a kid and I started like,

3
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,730
you know,
reading magazines and in reading

4
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:20,690
cookbooks,
just,

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,670
you know,
for recipes and that kind of thing.

6
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:23,730
I mean,
there was um,

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,340
had Andy Burchette,
a government magazine and Mimi Sheraton

8
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:31,690
was reviewing the New York Times.
Now the,

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,140
with the Internet magazines,
you have so many outlets for food

10
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:39,680
criticism.
Um,

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,580
it's just,
it's who keeps up with it really,

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,400
you know,
and he'd other the reviews the matter,

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,320
you know,
uh,

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,320
the New York Times,
New York magazine as far as New York

15
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:52,490
goes.
And then,

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,690
you know,
the Internet is a,

17
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:55,160
it's a funny place.
Um,

18
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,380
you know,
there's a real difference between,

19
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,830
um,
Jeffrey steingarten who has traveled all

20
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:08,090
over and this has years and years and
years about writing about food than just

21
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:10,280
someone who's very enthusiastic about
food.

22
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,210
Um,
and,

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,540
and commenting on it because to really
criticize,

24
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,780
I think dishes for what they are,
it's,

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,170
you know,
if you're really criticizing it,

26
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,650
you should have perspective and you
should have a historical perspective.

27
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,870
You should have a taste per se,
you know,

28
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:34,460
a perspective,
you know,

29
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,250
before you really can talk about a ramen
shop,

30
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,790
you probably should go to Japan,
uh,

31
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,530
than,
you know,

32
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:43,720
just coming on,
you know,

33
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,310
are criticizing it because if you like
it or not,

34
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,770
um,
or if,

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,440
you know,
the same thing goes with Haute French

36
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:55,090
cuisine or a traditional Italian dish.
Um,

37
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,360
but then again,
you know,

38
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:57,650
it's like,
it's like one,

39
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,410
um,
you know,

40
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,060
the wind gates could talk about wine
till they're blue in the face,

41
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:04,130
but my dad just,
if it's good,

42
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:05,150
it's good.
He likes it,

43
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:06,110
he likes it.
So

44
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,460
it's a,
it's a funny situation,

45
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:14,390
but because there's the enthusiasm and
then there's the criticism.

46
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,540
But critics have agendas.
Um,

47
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:21,380
it doesn't matter if you're a music
critic or a movie critic or a restaurant

48
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:23,580
critic,
there is an agenda you might like,

49
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,950
maybe you don't like Italian food or you
think Italian food can only reach so

50
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:29,390
high on the,
um,

51
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,640
uh,
excitement meter,

52
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:36,170
um,
or maybe you only really want fine

53
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:39,080
dining restaurants and you don't want
casual restaurants or there's always

54
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:43,600
some kind of agenda.
And that's where the personality of of

55
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,660
uh,
you know,

56
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:46,520
when the writing comes out,
I had a,

57
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:48,500
have a very,
very,

58
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,130
very famous food writer who will go
unnamed,

59
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,160
said that a restaurant reviewers only
review for other restaurant critics.

60
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,360
I'm a little bit like restaurant
designer is only designed for the

61
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:03,370
restaurant designers and movie critics
only.

62
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,900
It's kind of a phenomenon.
Uh,

63
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,080
some people love what I do and some
people hate it.

64
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,590
And that's always going to be.
I'm always going to be the situation.
