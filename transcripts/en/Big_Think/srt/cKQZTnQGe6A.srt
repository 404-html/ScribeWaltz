1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,660
Now remember,
Central Asia was under Soviet rule for

2
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:15,620
many decades,
and before that it was part of the

3
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:20,240
czarist empire.
This is an area of many different ethnic

4
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:21,770
groups.
The Uzbeks,

5
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,960
the Tajiks,
the Kazaks,

6
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:27,050
the Kyrgies,
and to some degree,

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,970
the territory is that these groups
inhabited would never really clearly

8
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:35,090
demarcated there.
They're nomadic people,

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,890
so they have traditional lands.
But the Zaras came in and said,

10
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:41,420
okay,
this is where we're going to draw the

11
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:43,760
lines.
And then the Soviets came in and drew

12
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:48,761
the lines and they don't really bear
close approximation to where the

13
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,450
particular people lived.
So there are a lot of competing claims

14
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:57,680
to wear.
Their territory should be,

15
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:03,010
and in these areas lie uranium,
lie natural gas and coal and oil.

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,500
So there are some struggles underway as
to who should control what of these

17
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:18,140
valuable areas.
So you could have fights in the future

18
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:21,130
that a territorial over,
you know,

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,330
who should get these prized areas.

20
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,630
Now on top of that,
you have a situation where most of the

21
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:33,830
governments in these areas are
controlled by people who were once part

22
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:37,490
of the Soviet bureaucratic machine.
You know,

23
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:38,051
they,
they,

24
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:41,900
they look and smell like old sue Soviet
bureaucrats.

25
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,650
Right.
And they're,

26
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,040
they're not,
you know,

27
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,700
they claim to be Democrats,
but they're really not.

28
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,100
They're,
they're really very authoritarian.

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,330
And with the new wealth coming from oil
and natural gas,

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,310
well most of that money winds up in the
hands of their friends and relatives and

31
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:06,311
cronies and a lot of of the wealth
disappears into hidden bank account

32
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,280
somewhere.
Uh,

33
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,300
you know,
I'm thinking particularly of the family

34
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,520
of Nursultan Nazarbayev,
the president of Kazakhstan,

35
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:18,860
which is the wealthiest of these
countries.

36
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,470
Meanwhile,
most of the people in these countries

37
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:26,390
are not getting any wealthier since the
breakup of the Soviet Union.

38
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,650
These are also predominantly Muslim
countries.

39
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,890
They have been a target of the,
of the Muslim Islamic fundamentalist

40
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:42,731
movements of the past decade or so.
I'm talking of groups associated with

41
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:50,441
Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda and some of
the other extremist movements that we've

42
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:55,721
heard of.
And these groups are finding some

43
00:02:56,121 --> 00:03:01,030
sympathy among the people of these areas
who the governments to be corrupt,

44
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,950
to be insensitive to their needs,
to be pocketing all the money and giving

45
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:10,930
it to their cronies.
So in the future you could have

46
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,030
uprisings,
like the kind,

47
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:18,031
we've had another countries that are
fueled by Islamic propaganda,

48
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,750
but really at heart are about the
Maldistribution of resource wealth.

49
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,090
You know,
kind of like what I was talking about in

50
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:33,091
the Niger Delta area where the elites
claim all of the resource wealth

51
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,110
conditions are deteriorating,
the masses of the people are getting

52
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:40,750
worse off,
not better conditions,

53
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:44,200
a deteriorating.
And this is exactly the kind of fertile

54
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:47,910
atmosphere in which extremist movements
take off.

55
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,650
And,
and this is what I worry about.

56
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,220
This is an area of geopolitical
competition between three great powers.

57
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,840
This is the one part of the globe in
which the United States,

58
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,290
Russia and China are all competing for
influence.

59
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,320
At the same time,
the United States,

60
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,410
after the breakup of the Soviet Union
saw this is an area to gain geopolitical

61
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:19,771
advantage and new sources of energy.
So first President Clinton and now

62
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:25,201
President Bush have made an all out
effort to gain influence in the stands

63
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:29,020
is they're called Kazakhstan,
Uzbekistan,

64
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:33,370
Turkmenistan and Tajikistan Kyrgyzstan
if I get them all right,

65
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,910
but Russia which used to control this
area under the Soviets and before that

66
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:43,330
the tsars also wants to control this
area.

67
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,500
But now you have a third factor in here,
China,

68
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,950
which is very worried about instability
and its back door.

69
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,200
The Chinese region of Shen Jiang,
which has a Muslim majority area and

70
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:06,631
it's extreme west and it's the one part
of China that's predominantly Muslim.

71
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,570
They are very worried about instability
in this area.

72
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,600
So it wants to have a say in what goes
on in Central Asia and it has growing

73
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,520
economic interests in this area.
Also wants to tap into the,

74
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,120
the resource riches of Central Asia has
also become involved.

75
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,670
So you have three great powers all
seeking geopolitical influence it once

76
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,820
the United States is providing military
aid,

77
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,620
Russia is providing military aid and now
China has stepped in,

78
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,950
collaborating often with Russia through
a new organization known as the Shanghai

79
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,740
Cooperation Organization or the SCO.
And the Seo pr jointly with,

80
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,680
you know,
China and Russia together provide

81
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,130
military aid to the stands.
If this isn't enough,

82
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,870
both United States and Russia have
established military bases in the

83
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:08,210
region,
namely and Kyrgyzstan.

84
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,600
You have about 50 miles apart,
a US base on one side of Bishkek,

85
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,910
the Capitol of Kyrgyzstan and a Russian
base.

86
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:20,750
On the other side.
I mentioned all of this because you have

87
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:25,751
to imagine a situation in the future
where there's some kind of upheaval and

88
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,290
Kyrgyzstan between,
you know,

89
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:35,291
one political faction against the other.
The military breaks apart and somehow or

90
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:41,000
another American soldiers and Russian
soldiers get caught up in the conflict

91
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,893
and overnight

92
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,650
have shooting.
