1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,450
A few important things that patients
need to do in order to prevent a

2
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,380
recurrence?
Um,

3
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,800
well the first thing is to really
manage,

4
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,930
you know,
your own follow up appointments.

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,100
I think there's a few of us that were
surprised that doctors don't send that

6
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:31,110
little card out in the mail to remind
you,

7
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:33,630
like a dentist used to do,
uh,

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,580
to remind you of those followup
appointments.

9
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:39,780
It's your responsibility to manage those
and you've got several doctors

10
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:43,740
appointments to follow up depending on
the type of a treatment.

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,170
For me,
I had to,

12
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:48,090
to follow up with my surgeon and
oncologist,

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,100
my radiologist and a for a while first
year and my plastic surgeon.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,620
Uh,
so there were several appointments that

15
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:57,600
I needed to,
to manage and monitor.

16
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,380
And that is critical that you stay on
top of that.

17
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:03,720
They're not going to call and remind you
it's,

18
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,400
uh,
doesn't happen and a,

19
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,710
so it's your responsibility.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,670
I also believe that changing your
lifestyle is important.

21
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,760
This isn't the lifestyle you have had
cancer.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,440
It's over.
You're done.

23
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:20,070
We're hair starts to grow back and you
start to feel better and healthy and

24
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:23,820
your life moves on.
But at the end of the day you had cancer

25
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:27,660
and it's now lifestyle that you need to
monitor and manage.

26
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:28,950
That means,
uh,

27
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:32,340
you know,
looking at your diet and eating healthy

28
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:33,230
foods.
Um,

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,130
there's been a big link to um,
uh,

30
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,600
having,
having extra weight and,

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,940
and fat in the Diet and on your body,
a linking with cancer.

32
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:45,900
So being healthy and eating well,
exercise.

33
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,170
Um,
and just being very cognizant of how

34
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:53,730
you're,
you feel on a day to day basis,

35
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:58,140
how your body feels and recognizing any
potential symptoms to,

36
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,570
you know,
make that phone call.

37
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:01,700
If there's any concern.

38
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,841
Well,
I'll tell you,

39
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,350
I definitely treated this cancer a
little differently than the first one.

40
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:20,310
I knew to take care of myself.
I need to stay positive.

41
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,800
I need to wait to find out all the
information.

42
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,290
Uh,
when I went to see my doctors before I

43
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,690
panicked,
before I went to the website.

44
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,310
So I implemented everything that I,
uh,

45
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,010
you know,
from experience.

46
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:37,410
I,
I did exactly what I tell everybody else

47
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:38,880
to do.
I followed the rules.

48
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:41,820
I called my insurance insurance carrier.
I,

49
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,720
uh,
made sure to have all my questions ready

50
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:48,420
before and prepare it before my doctor's
appointments.

51
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:52,170
I had all my paperwork and my slides,
pathology report.

52
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,710
I,
uh,

53
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,910
asked all the questions and had several
opinions before we went ahead and made

54
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:01,780
the final decision of the ta type of
treatment that I would,

55
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,190
uh,
take on.

56
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,860
So,
and even going through the process,

57
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:07,030
like,
I hate to say it,

58
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:08,650
but a variant cancer,
I thought,

59
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:10,150
you know,
I had breast cancer.

60
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:11,860
I know what the surgery is going to be
like.

61
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:12,880
I've had that.
I've,

62
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,470
you know,
I've,

63
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,060
I've had chemotherapy.
Well,

64
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:16,894
it was

65
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,540
okay

66
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,540
about 10 times harder,
uh,

67
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,180
with the surgery and the chemo.
That was a bit of a surprise.

68
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,620
But the process remains exactly how I
knew to get through it.

69
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:32,621
And I was able to stay positive and keep
my family from panicking and my friends

70
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:37,010
from panicking,
which is unfortunately one of the jobs

71
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:37,760
that are not,
uh,

72
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,330
sometimes we end up taking on is keeping
everybody else calm.

73
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,340
Um,
when your friends and families start to

74
00:03:43,341 --> 00:03:45,680
really panic.
But I was very lucky.

75
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:48,830
I got again,
an opportunity to see some wonderful

76
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:51,740
doctors I had.
Um,

77
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,380
I what else?

78
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,723
Um,

79
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,410
I have my counselor one on one planner
and Aye.

80
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,273
Aye.
Aye.

81
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:04,730
Yeah,

82
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:09,020
just before I was about to go to pressed
as to prepare this planner for people

83
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:12,680
with breast cancer,
I had to stop the process where we're at

84
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:14,900
in the middle of editing and about to
send it to the printer.

85
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:19,070
And I grabbed the prototype and I used
it and I though it was designed for

86
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,750
people with breast cancer.
I was the organizer component.

87
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,730
Um,
that really got me through the process

88
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,570
and was able to keep me calm and focused
about my next steps.

89
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:31,880
I had a place to put all my
appointments,

90
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,280
my notes,
my business cards,

91
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,520
and it really helped my mother who was
flew in from Chicago to be with me.

92
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,151
You know,
as a mother,

93
00:04:41,151 --> 00:04:44,930
she was just devastated.
So I think the plan are really kept us

94
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:48,260
both organized and everything.
All our notes were in one place where we

95
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:49,700
could share this book together.
