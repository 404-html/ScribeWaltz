00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,710
There's a lot of talk lately about what
role the privatization of space might

2
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:08,711
play in our future ambitions of space
exploration and from where I sit,

3
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:12,740
there's a lot of delusional thinking
there.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,840
For example,
unlike what Newt Gingrich said in a

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,100
presidential debate there he is saying,
had we given the money we had given to

6
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:23,990
NASA,
to the private sector,

7
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:27,050
we would have been on the moon and Mars
by now and we'd have done it more

8
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:29,360
cheaply and everything would be fine and
dandy.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,510
No,
it doesn't work that way.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,600
Private enterprise in the history of
civilization has never led

11
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,840
large,
expensive,

12
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,630
dangerous projects with unknown risks.

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,720
That has never happened because when you
combine all these factors,

14
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,910
you cannot create a capital market
valuation of that activity.

15
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,050
The first Europeans to the new world,
we're not sailors on the Dutch east

16
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:10,030
India trading company ships.
It was Columbus,

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,690
it was Magellan,
and these were voyages funded by

18
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:16,420
governments.
Somebody has to draw the maps.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,670
Somebody has to see where the dangerous
spots are,

20
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,010
where it's safe,
what the prevailing winds are.

21
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,120
Once that is established,
then private enterprise can come in and

22
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:26,380
say,
here's the risk.

23
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,600
I need an investor.
Here's your payback.

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,520
If we can turn this into an enterprise,
so no private enterprise is not going to

25
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:35,770
lead us to the moon.
They're not going to lead us to Mars.

26
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,530
What'd be nice for them to do is take on
our low earth orbit.

27
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,240
Activity's been there,
done that back in the sixties.

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,470
Low Earth orbit was a frontier we didn't
know who can humans survive?

29
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,510
Can you even swallow?
If you were in orbit,

30
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,440
would saliva get caught in your throat?
Simple questions like that were unknown

31
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:57,040
and unanswered at the time.
We're well past that.

32
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,590
We know how to get to low earth orbit.
It's done.

33
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:02,620
The patents are offered or given
granted,

34
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:06,610
and so that'd be the ideal place for
private enterprise to take over.

35
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,940
Tourism would easily drive that much
money.

36
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,940
Americans in the world spends on
tourism.

37
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,350
You can have a tourist lotteries if
where you could win a much more

38
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:19,510
expensive vacation than you could
otherwise afford.

39
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,610
I certainly buy lottery tickets if it
meant taking a vacation in space or

40
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,090
rather in orbit around Earth,
which I guess we'll still call that

41
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:30,430
space.
But if NASA is advancing a spaceman tier

42
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:33,190
that's Kinda really just driving around
the block at that point,

43
00:02:33,191 --> 00:02:35,280
but that would,
could surely sell tickets and I'd.

44
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,390
I'd be first in line.
