1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,943
Yeah,

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,540
I think Eddie artist's responsibility is
first and foremost to create good art

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,700
and I think hip hop.
I'm certainly not the first to say this,

4
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:23,000
probably not the first to say this on
big thing,

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,540
but hip hop has always been held to
standards that I thought were

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,500
unrealistic and unfair and standards
that no other modern pop music forum has

7
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:36,501
been held to as far as the our lyrical
contents and how much we deliver a

8
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:42,561
substantive message or whether we craft
our music into a comprehensive handbook

9
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:46,380
for how to live your life.
I mean,

10
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:50,580
I don't think anyone has ever looked at
blues or jazz or country or any other

11
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:52,320
form.
No one has ever looked at John Coltrane

12
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:57,060
and said he's failing as an artist
because he didn't provide a detailed

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,860
blueprint for political change in our
country or a detailed blueprint for how

14
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:02,790
to raise your children.

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,520
You know,
because people recognize that the value

16
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:09,720
of John Coltrane's music comes in its
musical expressiveness.

17
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,910
But with hip hop,
a lot of people don't recognize hip

18
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:17,460
hop's musical value.
So they latch onto what's easier for

19
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:19,560
them to understand.
Which is the lyrical content and judging

20
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,180
strictly on that basis.
So I think hip hop gets a raw deal in a

21
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:27,900
lot of ways,
especially because right when hip hop

22
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:29,990
was beginning to be discovered by the
mainstream.

23
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,910
It was right towards the end of what
people call a conscious era with groups

24
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:37,911
like public enemy who raised hopes very
high for having this generation fill the

25
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:42,240
void that had been left behind when the
civil rights movement ended.

26
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,390
Um,
the black power era had ended due to

27
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:48,540
cointelpro and self implosion and
whatever else went on.

28
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,550
I mean,
I think people were hoping for some kind

29
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:54,540
of voice to rise up and when you had
public enemy and all the other groups

30
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:59,541
around him speaking so compellingly,
I think people got their hopes so high

31
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:02,610
that they get really unrealistic
expectations for how much these young

32
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:04,020
musicians could really deliver.

33
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,920
As far as offering substantive social
and political leadership.

34
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,830
And I think,
I mean,

35
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,440
I working,
working in sort of a left wing

36
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:17,550
progressive circle of nonprofit media
has always been a struggle for me to get

37
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:21,810
people to recognize that hip hop should
be recognized for his musical value

38
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:24,480
first and foremost.
And if we're making great music,

39
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:29,430
then we did our jobs and if we're
expressing something that's explicitly

40
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:30,990
political or positive,
that's great,

41
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:33,190
but that's icing on the cake.
If you don't have the foundation of

42
00:02:33,191 --> 00:02:34,880
great music underneath that,
you know,

43
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,310
it doesn't matter if it was all about
the message and only the message.

44
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:40,290
Cornell West would be the best rapper in
the world,

45
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,760
which I'm sure he would agree.
Yes.
