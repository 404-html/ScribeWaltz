1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,430
Okay,

2
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,093
what's changing is the idea that um,
elections are controlled by a small 

3
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:24,351
group of professional campaigners,
consultants and,

4
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,560
and,
uh,

5
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,990
um,
fundraisers and pollsters and the,

6
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,370
the big media people who kind of write 
the,

7
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,503
the frame that's all being opened up.
And what we experienced in the United 

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,600
States was the first,
uh,

9
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:44,700
what I call it,
mass participation election.

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,773
Literally millions of people waking up 
every day and being involved in the 

11
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:51,714
election way before election day and 
mobilizing their friends in organizing 

12
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,893
events,
in doing their own micro fundraisers in 

13
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:04,740
creating their own messages and 
spreading them online.

14
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,080
Um,
and that,

15
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:12,081
that is a new dynamic when you have out 
of a country with maybe 120,

16
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:14,040
100,
30 million voters,

17
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,940
10 or $20 million of them that actively 
involved.

18
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:18,923
It definitely changes the dynamic of 
politics and the world that politicians 

19
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:25,840
have to operate in.
So that's the big.
