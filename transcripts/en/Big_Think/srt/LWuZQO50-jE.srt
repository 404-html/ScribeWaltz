1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,070
No.
Well

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,580
it depends on what you describe as big
media is Google big media now.

3
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:19,160
I mean they're worth more than most of
the other media companies.

4
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:21,410
There was a period of time when most of
the cable companies,

5
00:00:21,411 --> 00:00:25,310
they were worth more,
at least in Wall Street market cap terms

6
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:29,510
and then the broadcast networks.
It seems in media that no one ever

7
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:33,290
really goes away.
It's when something new comes out

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,540
eventually,
first of all,

9
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:36,231
people say,
Oh,

10
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:40,220
you know,
TV's going to kill radio and then cable

11
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:43,730
TV is going to kill tv and you know this
or that,

12
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:45,830
or the other thing is going to always
kill something off.

13
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:50,831
Somehow everybody moves over on the
bench and nothing really goes away.

14
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:55,160
I mean some formats might go away like
the eight track or the cassette or the

15
00:00:55,161 --> 00:01:00,161
LP,
but the idea pretty much continues and

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,200
in the end,
the big media companies,

17
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:06,110
which facial lot of challenges now,
I mean you're talking about the

18
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:09,020
traditional TV,
cable TV companies,

19
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:10,850
they,
they face a lot of challenges from the

20
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:11,390
new media.

21
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,450
They will eventually morph into that
world,

22
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:18,620
be bought by a new media company by one,
and turn will still find ways to

23
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:21,260
participate.
It's going to be hard.

24
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,520
I think it's naive to think that these
companies are going to crumble and fall

25
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:26,151
away.
I mean,

26
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:29,810
they're going through a very tough
transition now as our people in any

27
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:32,750
industry that has to deal with the
digitization of anything.

28
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,770
But at the end of the day,
there'll be a bunch of large companies,

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,950
pretty much controlling a good amount of
what goes on.

30
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:41,720
That seems to be,
you know,

31
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:45,320
the way of our capitalist system.
That's not to say that the small

32
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:48,290
independent voices still won't be out
there and be able to be heard,

33
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,180
but,
but the mass market,

34
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,940
as it as however you wanna define it,
uh,

35
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,570
will be reachable largely,
probably through bigger.
