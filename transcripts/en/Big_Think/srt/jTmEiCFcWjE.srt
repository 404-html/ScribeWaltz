1
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,040
Without even knowing the world because
we didn't have any of the other chemical

2
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:24,680
fertilizer and so forth.
So we know how to do it.

3
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,960
We know what sustainable,
we knew how to very crap so that the,

4
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,360
we don't,
uh,

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,530
you know,
diminish the quality of the earth and so

6
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:35,090
forth.
So we know how to do that.

7
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,800
We know how to use a natural fertilizer
and all that.

8
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:43,260
So it's not that we don't know it a
little more work and the food is ship.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,540
The food is to ship in this country.
If it was a little more expensive and

10
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,460
people will come in,
drove.

11
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,660
And apparently the,
the,

12
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:51,494
the,
the,

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,350
the,
the organic market is working 20% up

14
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,550
every year.
And so it's been moving and incredible

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,790
speed,
but it's still very expensive for

16
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:05,690
certain people.
By the time that it will be only 30 or

17
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:09,950
40% more than regular product,
people are going to move in,

18
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:10,641
drove,
you know,

19
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:12,020
to,
to organic product.

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,913
And we should,

21
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,270
I believe so.
I believe that the,

22
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,090
even when I was at Howard Johnson,
everything that you can,

23
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,410
uh,
you can produce well,

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,440
especially now with new technique of
Soviets and other innovation in

25
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:32,050
technology that come about,
if it's done with the best product to

26
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:34,270
start with,
it will cost money.

27
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,280
I mean,
there is great product now which come

28
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:39,880
from Spain for example,
can product with new way of canning,

29
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,030
which,
uh,

30
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,460
don't have to be retarded that is cooked
so long so that it diminish a great deal

31
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:48,340
of the taste in the,
so there is all kinds of new innovation.

32
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:51,250
Yes,
I absolutely believe that technically we

33
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:54,670
will be able,
we already able to do food which tastes

34
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:59,230
great and are healthy and are good for
you and are absolutely delicious,

35
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:00,390
which is what sandbox.
