1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,530
Well,
we had been on the same page on

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,200
immigration reform.
Our Democratic Caucus has adopted

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,410
certain principles that relate to
securing our borders and enforcing our

4
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:20,310
laws,
protecting our workers,

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,450
unifying families,
and having a path to legalization.

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,340
And they were the principles that we had
been arguing from debating from,

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,010
uh,
for several years now.

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,530
So I would hope that any comprehensive
immigration reform that we would have a

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,860
would contain those principles.
We also recognize that immigration is

10
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:43,980
essential to our competitiveness.
We need all the fresh,

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,330
wonderful thinking from all over the
world to be part of our economy.

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,470
And we also need many of the young
people who have been educated in our

13
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:57,330
institutions of higher learning,
especially in the sciences to stay here.

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,360
So a short of a comprehensive
immigration reform at or part of it.

15
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,650
We'd like to see a green card stapled to
every,

16
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,940
a graduate degree.
In that regard.

17
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,130
I appreciate the question because I have
said to the president and to my

18
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:21,360
colleagues and to all who will listen is
that we will not be in a position to

19
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:26,310
have the comprehensive immigration
reform that we want unless we enlarge

20
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,600
the issue.
Many people are concerned in our country

21
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:33,150
is that their job security and they
think they're losing their job because

22
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:38,151
of trade or because of immigration.
So until we have progressive economic

23
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:42,840
agenda creating good paying jobs in
America,

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,050
people have more sense of security
themselves.

25
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,320
Uh,
we won't be able to have the immigration

26
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:54,270
reform that is necessary and worthy of
the subject that we are addressing.

27
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,880
So I,
I believe the foundation has to be laid

28
00:01:56,881 --> 00:02:01,470
by a strong economic job producing job,
creating business,

29
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:06,471
creating a agenda for America.
And then we can go to the next step.
