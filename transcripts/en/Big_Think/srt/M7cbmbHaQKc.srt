1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,230
Pages contains all the innovation,
so what you need to do is preserve those

2
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:16,470
who are innovative,
get the hammer,

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,380
no reward for being innovative,
and the founding fathers put that in the

4
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:22,390
constitution.
It's interesting,

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,210
everybody talks about the rights of
people this,

6
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:26,230
right?
That right.

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,370
I went to a graduation,
my wife got a doctorate in public health

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,520
and the speaker said,
you have a right to good health or

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,640
saying what are they talking about?
They've lost their minds.

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,710
It means I'm never going to have a tooth
to gang.

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,990
I've never even had a stomach ache,
you know,

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,600
I ever write to,
you know,

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,120
not have cancer or something,
who going to give me these rights?

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,420
The only right that is spelled out in
the constitution is the copyright.

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,720
And what it says is those who innovate
should get the reward for their

16
00:00:57,881 --> 00:01:02,680
innovation,
for copyright from patents and a general

17
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:05,770
ip on that.
And Lincoln was a big believer in this.

18
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:09,010
In fact,
Lincoln took out some patents and uh,

19
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:12,610
he loved the idea of that.
So when you think to yourself,

20
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,350
what could encourage innovation?
A lot of conventional thinkers who would

21
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:18,184
say,
oh,

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,160
just you know,
for the government to spend a lot more

23
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:23,560
money on our end date,
the founder says,

24
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:24,460
well,
that's fine,

25
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:29,910
but the best thing we can do to spur our
r and d is not spent any money but to

26
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:33,070
provide it so that the creators get to
keep what they have.
