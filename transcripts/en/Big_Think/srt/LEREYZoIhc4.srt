00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,410
They're waiting to be explored.
My favorite things,

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,020
I'm very.
They aren't really favorite themes.

3
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:28,050
They sort of compulsive themes.
Last year I think obviously a lot about

4
00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:32,330
global warming.
Anybody who thinks thinks about global

5
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:34,380
warming.
Um,

6
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,930
last year I found that every poem that I
started to write turned out to be a

7
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:43,931
pound for garb about global warming and
that was not a healthy situation.

8
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:46,520
I realized I could only write about
that,

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,360
so I had to forcibly move myself away
from that theme back to other themes.

10
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,310
Each poem has an essence of colonel,
every work of art as Peter Brook,

11
00:00:58,311 --> 00:01:00,530
the Great Theater director pointed that
out,

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,560
that you can reduce any work of art to
one kernel of force of colon

13
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:12,020
inspiration.
And if every poem is trying to use that

14
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:14,930
same kernel,
then you're going to become repetitive

15
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:16,290
and become dull.
