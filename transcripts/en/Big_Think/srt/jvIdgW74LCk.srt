1
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,070
I have a chapter on reasonable doubt and
it's about,

2
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:15,071
of course the phrase reasonable doubt
covers up in courts of law where juries

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,910
are told that they must convict somebody
of murder only if there is,

4
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,990
it's beyond reasonable doubt that they
are guilty.

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,220
And that sounds all very good.
It should be beyond reasonable doubt.

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,780
But when you think about the fact that I
think about courtroom dramas which are

7
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:37,781
so popular on television for example,
and I suspect that this accurately

8
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:41,680
portray something like what goes on in
real courtrooms.

9
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,990
And I've certainly been on three juries
myself.

10
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,040
There is a note of suspense in the court
when the jury comes back,

11
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,440
which way will it go?
Will it be guilty or not guilty?

12
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,330
And then if they say not guilty,
um,

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,590
certain people have a great sign of
relief if they say guilty,

14
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:58,424
other people do.

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,740
So there is a lot of doubt in the
courtroom among people who've sat

16
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:06,260
through the entire trial.
The judge,

17
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:07,430
for example,
the lawyers,

18
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:10,970
the audience sat through the entire
trial as the jewelry has.

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,920
So if the jury comes in and
brings in a verdict that is beyond

20
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:20,810
reasonable doubt,
everybody in the code should know that.

21
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,900
If it's beyond reasonable doubt,
there can be no doubt of which way the

22
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:25,640
jewelry we'll,
uh,

23
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,450
we'll jump.
And yet when the jewelry do give their

24
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:30,284
verdict,
because

25
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,060
how can that be if it's beyond
reasonable doubt?

26
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,980
Imagine the following experiment.
Suppose that you had two juries

27
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:46,280
listening to the same evidence and the
two juries not allowed to talk to each

28
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:48,230
other.
They are sent off into separate jury

29
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:51,590
rooms and they come up with their own
separate verdicts.

30
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,960
Who would bet on the jury's coming back
with the same verdict every single time.

31
00:01:56,961 --> 00:02:00,980
But actually nobody would in my,
if you think about the Oj Simpson trial

32
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:02,150
or for example,
any 40,

33
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:04,340
based on another jury coming up with the
same verdict,

34
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,200
um,
and yet,

35
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,140
unless you can bet,
unless you can say yes,

36
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:10,610
they would come up with the same
verdict.

37
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,450
You cannot really take the phrase beyond
reasonable doubt.

38
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,990
Seriously.
Now,

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,130
I'm not suggesting that we should have
two juries in every trial.

40
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,820
I'm just pointing out that the phrase
beyond reasonable doubt,

41
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,070
it doesn't actually mean what it says.
