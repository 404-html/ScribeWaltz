1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,280
Unpassionate about positive thinking
from the early books written the power

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:08,940
of positive thinking and all the experts
in the past.

3
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:11,040
Many of them,
I knew them later on in life,

4
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:12,420
met them in different parts of the
world,

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,870
but I,
I apply it because if you study any of

6
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:20,280
the writings and the tissues of positive
thinking,

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,590
you have to have a goal in your mind.
Otherwise you're thinking blindly.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,900
You don't walk in and you don't walk to
a destination without having an idea of

9
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:32,850
what you're going,
where you're going.

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,360
So it's positive thinking isn't just
thinking to yourself,

11
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:38,970
well,
I can do anything I want and so forth

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,460
because some things we can't do.
I,

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,780
I have some people I know personally.
I wish they felt they could float if

14
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:47,370
they walked out of an airplane in the
sky.

15
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:48,630
No,
I'm not being nasty.

16
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:52,890
I'm just being crazy.
But the real positive thinking is having

17
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:57,891
goals because a,
a golfer never hits a ball and so he

18
00:00:58,031 --> 00:00:58,930
sees where it's going.

19
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,420
Never hits a ball and police sees words.
Otherwise it's going.

20
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,800
Neither does a picture when he throws a
ball.

21
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,250
So we have to have in our lives some
direction and we have to think with,

22
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,610
with the positiveness that we're going
to take advantage of all the

23
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:18,490
opportunities that lead to that
direction.

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,820
But the interesting thing is when
failures take place and study the lives

25
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:28,600
of famous people,
they found alternative routes which

26
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:31,750
often caused them to invent new
machinery,

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,640
new paraphernalia that didn't work when
the other thing failed because they had

28
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:40,360
to be resourceful.
The same as you are in a war.

29
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:43,090
When you're playing a game in which
you're playing against a team and

30
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:45,160
something goes wrong.
It's the same.

31
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,100
Life is really a game show.
You have to,

32
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,690
you have to have a flexibility and those
things take place.

33
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,330
Not only in knowing in your heart and
soul,

34
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:58,060
you're going to find a route.
You're going to find the root to this

35
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,600
place you want to go to,
whether it's working in a,

36
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:02,480
in a,
uh,

37
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:07,481
a large food complex because you like to
cook and what have you and your say food

38
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,200
or whether it's working on a sports team
or what have you.

39
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,420
But you also have to figure,
you know,

40
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:16,210
if this thing doesn't happen,
maybe there's something in the

41
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:19,930
background there that I didn't notice
that I could take advantage of in the

42
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,680
same way that sometimes.
And let's take a lesson from chefs.

43
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,580
If they don't have a certain
piece,

44
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,120
a certain appetizer that's,
that's there for that food,

45
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,530
there's often a couple of other ones
that can be edit that turns out,

46
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:41,580
can make it a new chased,
a new dessert.

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,180
And that's the way you have to think
about like as a meal at your adding to.
