1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,370
I grew up in suburbia,
Salt Lake City,

2
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:14,070
Utah for the most part just right
outside of salt lake.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,710
Um,
I'm the oldest of six,

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,020
kind of a very typical mormon
upbringing,

5
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:21,480
very wholesome,
going to lab church.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,771
And,
uh,

7
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:26,250
I joined the army when I was 17.
They have a program that allows you to

8
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:30,210
join like the reserves or the national
guard or the reserves while you're still

9
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:32,360
in high school.
Go to boot camp,

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,420
uh,
come back,

11
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:36,030
finish your senior year and then go back
and training and finish all your

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,340
advanced training.
Uh,

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,360
so that's what I did right after I
turned 17 in January and I hadn't listed

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,810
by February.
I enlisted the day after the ground war,

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,970
uh,
for the first Gulf war started.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,120
And uh,
what I've always told people why I

17
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:52,050
joined,
which is the,

18
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,030
the most honest answer I can give you,
the why I joined is that I was 17 and

19
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:59,250
that's it.
It was the first adult decision that I

20
00:00:59,251 --> 00:00:59,871
got to make.
I,

21
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:01,650
I grew up playing gi joe and stuff like
that.

22
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:02,610
So it's like a fun thing.
Like,

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,061
oh,
hey,

24
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:03,841
I can kind of,
you know,

25
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:06,960
be a boy scout or a kid for their
perpetually.

26
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,030
And that appealed to me.
So I joined.

27
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,800
Wow.
Can I haven't talked about this one in

28
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:16,710
the wild that,
that it was okay.

29
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,010
I'm from Utah.
Nothing happens in Utah and moved to New

30
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,430
York City in 2000.
The towers come down in September,

31
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,660
2001.
Um,

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,830
of course my initial reaction is one of
complete disbelief.

33
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,520
We live,
you know,

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,930
they say how sometimes you can look
right at something and not believe it.

35
00:01:32,931 --> 00:01:33,900
Well,
that was the first time I've ever really

36
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:36,330
experienced that where I get a phone
call,

37
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:37,030
my buddy says,
hey,

38
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,190
the towers had been hit.
I'm like,

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,580
shut up asshole.
Don't come in for new.

40
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:41,640
Never again.
And don't tell me ridiculous crap like

41
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:42,474
that.
Come on.

42
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,810
Then I realized it's not kidding.
Um,

43
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,580
you know,
watching the news walk out to west

44
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:49,350
Broadway.
By the time I walked out to west

45
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:52,050
Broadway,
the first tower had already fell and I'm

46
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:55,920
looking right at where it was and I'm
not seeing it.

47
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,480
And it's like,
where's the tower?

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,810
I don't get it,
what happened?

49
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,720
I just,
I'm looking on that sky and I couldn't

50
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,000
and I didn't,
I could not process that.

51
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:06,510
The time I was in there,
I walk away to try and watch some news

52
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:06,910
and like,
ah,

53
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,730
maybe I should just watch it.
I go back a second time.

54
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:12,470
Now the second tower tower is fallen.
So I mean it's probably instead of

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,200
business lean of times,
uh,

56
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,550
the feeling of complete disbelief.
We were,

57
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,980
I,
I figured pretty much any national

58
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:22,740
guardsman in New York City at that time
knew they were going to get called up.

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,150
So we just all without being told,
started like congregating at our

60
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:31,440
respective armories and we were at
ground zero or near Ground Zero that

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,300
night.
The first two days we guarded,

62
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,120
uh,
an area a few blocks away,

63
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,860
you know,
from the sites.

64
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,460
And then by the third day,
the third week of the 11th day,

65
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,190
so I guess it was like a 20 seconds.
Uh,

66
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:47,280
we just did what we do as soldiers,
which is guard stuff.

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,450
We'd work 12 hour shifts.
Uh,

68
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,430
my platoon in particular,
it was stationed between buildings four

69
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:56,760
and five and all we did was guard.
We set up a perimeter,

70
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,830
um,
around a big,

71
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,470
and our job was to simply screen who
came in to the whole,

72
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,230
the fire.
The fire chief was in charge of the site

73
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,761
and he would tell us,
okay,

74
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:14,110
here I'm going to own the ironworkers in
or only let in ems world was the dogs.

75
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,350
And that's what we did.
And just kind of said their garden stuff

76
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:21,130
and told people who didn't have the
correct authorization from the fire

77
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,920
chief to fuck off.
Which was actually kind of interesting

78
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:28,921
because anyone who has a suit or badge
or anything was down there to include

79
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,900
FBI,
CIA,

80
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,280
Nsa,
guys like,

81
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,000
you know,
every,

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,880
everyone showed up there was
firefighters came from a Minnesota

83
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,200
wanting to help and we had to turn away,
which was kind of heartbreaking.

84
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,280
Um,
and that was her job is to kind of guard

85
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:46,114
a big hole.

86
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,350
There was some kind of unscrupulous
stuff that I think a lot of people don't

87
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:53,770
love talking about.
And uh,

88
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,640
looting was a bit of that.
Uh,

89
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,880
it's,
it's,

90
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,470
it's,
it's hard to thing about it because it's

91
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:03,540
not,
when we think about a ground zero and

92
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:07,140
nine 11,
and all the incredibly heroic things

93
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:09,300
that took place that day and the amount
of the outpouring of,

94
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,200
basically it was love that came from the
people who were in the army.

95
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,740
We have just kids in the lower east side
go running around with like doughnut

96
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:17,940
carts,
giving us donuts just because they want

97
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:20,070
to.
And it was all these wonderful stories.

98
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,520
But then there's also the storage to
have I like,

99
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,380
but there was a soldier in my,
you know,

100
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,580
one of the,
one of our soldiers had found like a box

101
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:30,480
of money and he didn't think that didn't
even cross his mind that it was wrong to

102
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,553
dilute it.

103
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,050
He ended up getting kicked out of the
army or just being an idiot.

104
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,990
There were some,
I know there were some problems too with

105
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:41,991
people who are in positions of trust,
who were taking advantage of the fact

106
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:44,430
that a lot of,
like the stores,

107
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:45,760
especially in the basements,
uh,

108
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,500
of the World Trade Center are now broken
and unguarded.

109
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,010
Um,
and I think that's really kind of a sore

110
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:57,330
spot for a lot of people.
I don't know how I details some,

111
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,580
I'm being kind of careful about what I
say about it,

112
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,520
but there were some problems with that
and I,

113
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,080
it was handled.
And hopefully that's kind of the end of

114
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:07,200
it.
