1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,090
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,210
standup comedy is definitely harder.
I mean,

3
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:16,211
I like being on stage.
That's always been fun for me.

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,030
I'm better than A.
It's like people ask like,

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,770
how do you go up on stage?
I don't,

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,560
I don't think I could ever do it.
And my answer is like,

7
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:27,140
well,
I'm having trouble talking to you right

8
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:28,910
now.
It's like it's,

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,540
it's for some reason some people just
have it in their genetic makeup that

10
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:37,541
it's easier to go up and interact with a
group of strangers than it is to have

11
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:42,280
any kind of meaningful interaction with,
with a,

12
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:44,090
with a person whose eyes you have to
look into.

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,490
Um,
and I'm not saying that I'm a cold,

14
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:51,491
heartless monster,
but a little sick but still stand ups

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,070
harder because it's just you on your
own.

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,040
The great thing about the onion is it's
so collaborative,

17
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,980
you know,
it's almost kind of take on this group

18
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:01,814
mind there.

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,300
Um,
and people are really willing to

20
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:08,690
sacrifice their own personal pet
headlines,

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,720
um,
or their own preference on a joke for

22
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:12,890
the,
for the good of the,

23
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,810
of,
of the onion,

24
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:17,130
for the good of the product.
Um,

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,240
I don't think either that they,
that stand up informs my work at the

26
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:27,460
onion very much or vice versa,
um,

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,750
because they're pretty different in
style of the standup,

28
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:31,200
tends to be a little more,
um,

29
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,983
of a,
a

30
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,050
little more,
um,

31
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,730
kind of do this kind of character who
that exaggerates all of my own

32
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,410
nervousness and neuroses and they tend
to be a little more conceptual,

33
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,340
like as a,
as a eight minute set,

34
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,610
then telling a joke and then telling an
unrelated joke and then telling an

35
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:53,780
unrelated joke,
I can't,

36
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,970
uh,
I sort of can't write jokes that way

37
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,760
personally.
I have to think about how do I want

38
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:02,120
this,
this eight minutes to feel so that it

39
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:07,121
says awkward for the audience as
possible while also being funny and then

40
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:12,590
sort of right to that as opposed to this
is a good joke that I will expand on and

41
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,570
then find a segue into something else
for me.

42
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,030
I just can't.
It's really hard for me to do that.

43
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,340
Um,
so one thing the onion has sort of

44
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,430
taught me though is how to actually like
write material and how to hit a joke as

45
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:31,001
hard as you possibly can,
relentlessly until near to the point of,

46
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,520
of being too much.
So having that sense of something that

47
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,200
I've,
I've really gotten from working at the

48
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:37,040
onion,
you know,

49
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,190
over four years,
but the two are actually pretty,

50
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,720
pretty unrelated,
you know,

51
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:43,190
I do have a,
um,

52
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,970
a website that I keep up as well.
It's called the Joe Randazzo

53
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,803
Association,
which is,

54
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,950
now that I'm saying it,
it's this sort of large heartless

55
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,770
corporation,
um,

56
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,010
and it's the kind of goings on at the
office,

57
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,030
you know,
messages from,

58
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,540
from the HR representative and schedule
of events for a seminar and what the

59
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,460
lunch menu is going to be and it's those
kinds of things.

60
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,220
Um,
so the writing for that has definitely

61
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,580
been influenced a lot by my time at the
onion,

62
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,930
just didn't,
how to,

63
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,890
how to really write a joke.
But it's my own personal stuff because

64
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:24,340
sometimes you just need to write your
own personal stuff as well.

65
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,360
It's fun,
but it's also,

66
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:30,260
you know,
horrible.

67
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,100
Anybody who has to,
well,

68
00:03:34,101 --> 00:03:37,250
I don't know if anybody,
but when you have to sit down and write

69
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:40,460
something,
it's just the most dreadful feeling in

70
00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:42,140
the world for me anyway,
you know?

71
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,260
Uh,
but it's also really fun.

72
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:45,870
It's just,
you,

73
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,770
you forget when you're having fun,
you forget how,

74
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,460
how dreadful it is and when you're in
the dreadful,

75
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,770
you forget how fun it can be,
you know,

76
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,730
uh,
and you have to write something in order

77
00:03:58,731 --> 00:04:02,000
to be able to have material to perform.
And that's when the fun is.

78
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,940
Um,
so I guess I sort of actually force

79
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:08,120
myself to do it and I've listened to
other,

80
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,490
um,
there's this great podcast I listen to

81
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:12,860
called the creative screenwriting
magazine,

82
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,880
um,
where I'm Jeff Gold Smith is his name.

83
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,920
He's a senior editor at the magazine,
I think,

84
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:21,140
and he interviews different
screenwriters every week and he always

85
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:22,880
asks them if they,
uh,

86
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,223
what did they do?

87
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,090
Did they get writer's block and do they,
what do they do to get rid of it?

88
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:30,880
And every time I'm like,
Ha,

89
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,850
I always have writers,
but writers block is the default

90
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,120
position for me.
It's like such a struggle to get these

91
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:40,430
ideas out so they,
they don't want to come out,

92
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,370
even though they're in,
they're driving me crazy.

93
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,660
Um,
but it's also just an incredible,

94
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,630
incredible to be able to have a career
out of making people laugh and,

95
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,900
or a job anyway.
I don't know if it's gonna,

96
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,640
if it will be a career
where you sit around in a room and,

97
00:04:58,641 --> 00:04:59,070
and,
and,

98
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:04,010
and make people laugh and then put
together something that's so great that

99
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,900
I can be so proud of,
you know,

100
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:07,490
when you see people on the street
reading the onion,

101
00:05:07,491 --> 00:05:09,740
it's a really,
it's a really wonderful feeling.

102
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:11,240
And I always want to tell them,
you know,

103
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,510
I'm looking at mass tenets.
That's me.

104
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,040
Uh,
I've worked there.

105
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,660
Um,
so I'd say it's got to be that the fun

106
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,740
outweighs the dreadfulness for sure.
Yeah.

107
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,810
But it's work,
you know,

108
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,300
it's work.
