1
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,940
I was,
uh,

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,500
and I,
I am,

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,090
I'm a,
I'll just say a positional player,

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,360
but active positional player.
Uh,

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,000
so,
uh,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,833
they had,
uh,

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,080
a purely positional player who was
a world champion,

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,480
um,
for six years.

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,180
But,
uh,

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,180
I had a active positional style and uh,
I played,

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,130
I played quite strongly a endings,
so this was my,

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,430
my advantage also,
and then a different difficult positions

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,550
which is quite seldom in more than
chess.

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,893
Uh,
so,

15
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:51,060
and I could resist in a,
in a position for other place,

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,130
probably will resign.
And I,

17
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:55,950
I was,
I was,

18
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:56,784
uh,
uh,

19
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,430
finding,
uh,

20
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:01,470
interesting,
uh,

21
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:03,780
interesting ideas,
how to,

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,260
how to defend difficult positions and
uh,

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,720
I could save money games so I never gave
up.

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,610
I was a stubborn as a chess player and
uh,

25
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:17,580
so I,
I tried to defend even very bad

26
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:21,120
positions and uh,
in many cases succeeded

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,620
as a,
as a personality and fighter,

28
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:28,800
you know,
and,

29
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:31,160
uh,
I don't give up if I believe,

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,550
uh,
uh,

31
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,800
I'm a,
I'm correct.

32
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:38,640
I'm right.
Then I've broken a.

33
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,790
okay.
This could be overtures boards,

34
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,980
it could be in life.
And a saw.

35
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,490
I defend my principles and in just in
just,

36
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,820
okay,
this is a special,

37
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:53,940
uh,
special,

38
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:55,140
uh,
uh,

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,680
how to say a characteristic when you,
when you try to find the best for

40
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,360
whatever position is because many
people,

41
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:06,991
they say,
okay,

42
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:08,670
this is bad.
And then they,

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,140
they lose the will to fight.
I never lost will to fight.

44
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,550
This is a very important,
and this is good question because many

45
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:21,900
people would,
would,

46
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,420
uh,
the situation,

47
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:26,700
okay,
they miss chances and then of course it,

48
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,640
it will spoil the rest of the game.
Um,

49
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,643
but,
um,

50
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,370
it is concerning concerning not only
special situation during the game,

51
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:43,371
but also the results of previous game
for the next,

52
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,850
for the next game you play.
So now in my life I,

53
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,250
I tried and uh,
I succeeded in many cases to forget

54
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,190
every single was in the past.
So of course you need to make some

55
00:02:56,191 --> 00:03:00,280
analysis and not to repeat mistakes,
but it's extremely important,

56
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,020
uh,
to accept situation.

57
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:07,021
Like it is the real situation,
not with the salts and the regrets of

58
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,370
what,
what you missed.

59
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:10,230
And uh,
okay,

60
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,090
to mostly goal,
you'll have a winning position now

61
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:16,170
you'll have to defend difficult position
and probably,

62
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:18,310
you know,
you might lose the game.

63
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,750
So this shouldn't,
shouldn't be venue play when you play

64
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:26,520
chess game.
So later on might be you and a license,

65
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,610
then you know,
you have to see then you make some

66
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,000
conclusions by is a game.
And this is also really important part

67
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:42,001
for a,
for just education because a chess,

68
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,570
uh,
chess is getting ideas how to accept a,

69
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,990
how to accept a real situation and to
be,

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,990
uh,
to be objective,

71
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,610
to be objective and uh,
to,

72
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,530
to meet,
uh,

73
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:59,300
unexpected situations.
And uh,

74
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,460
to adapt this immediately and to start
to sink and to solve the problems,

75
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,290
you'll have to develop this.
So I don't think it comes from,

76
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,840
from your childhood,
obviously your bus.
