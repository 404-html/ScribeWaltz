1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:07,470
And there's a lot of people who are for
them and a lot of people are against

2
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:09,810
them.
It seems that most of the people who

3
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:12,960
are,
four of them are essentially ip holding

4
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:16,440
companies who just sit around and wait
with patents and wait until technology

5
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:19,560
actually gets interesting using
something that could potentially be

6
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,350
covered by these patents.
And then they sue people and they don't

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,150
generally,
they don't sue smaller companies.

8
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:28,800
They sue,
Microsoft and IBM and of course IBM and,

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,360
you know,
like all these big companies have their

10
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:33,780
own patents pools and they use them as
leverage against other companies with

11
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:35,340
patents.
Uh,

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,440
but I just,
you know,

13
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:41,250
I think there are so many problems with
it.

14
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:44,490
Uh,
the biggest problems are that you have

15
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:46,890
people patenting and things that are
essentially math,

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,560
which is what patents are not supposed
to be even about at all.

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,540
Um,
and the,

18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,730
I mean,
there are other problems.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,030
There are no,
it's,

20
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,620
I'm usually drunk when I give this
explanation and it comes out so much

21
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:05,454
smoother.
Um,

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,150
I,
I just think that there are a big

23
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:09,960
problem,
uh,

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,420
largely because,
uh,

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,170
you can infringe on them without knowing
that you do and as a smaller company you

26
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:17,080
have like,
very,

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,090
you don't have resources to go and
research whether or not you do it.

28
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,160
It's,
I could write a 100,000 lines of code

29
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:26,580
and for all I know 50,000 women fringe
on various things.

30
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,040
Um,
and I wouldn't know that.

31
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,530
And normally if you infringe someone's
trademark,

32
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:33,060
for example,
um,

33
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,690
if they don't enforce it,
uh,

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,960
it's to your advantage because a phase
they start to lose their rights.

35
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:44,340
Whereas patents,
if they don't enforce it for 10 years,

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,670
they can come and sue you for the 10
years that you've been making money on

37
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:49,650
their patent and you're completely
screwed.

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,590
So there's no incentive for them to
actually go and,

39
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,483
and,
uh,

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,880
try to legitimately licensed it.
It's really the kind of thing where

41
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,830
there are probably,
there's probably some middle ground

42
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:02,750
where,
uh,

43
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,160
it makes sense to have things be
patentable.

44
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,580
Um,
obviously in many places it does make

45
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:11,280
sense,
but things like software and people

46
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,050
patenting DNA,
it's,

47
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,913
it's,
uh,

48
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,060
it's at the point where you have things
that are so abstract that they really

49
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:23,061
should belong to everybody and no one's
really like making viable businesses on

50
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:24,990
software patents.
The only thing they're doing is

51
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,510
extorting money out of other people.
Um,

52
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,680
and the people who have the most
software patents probably don't even

53
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:34,980
want them to exist.
They're just forced to do it to cover

54
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:35,910
their own asses.
