1
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,140
I've always known that I was attracted
to guys to people of the same sex since

2
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:15,020
I was a little kid and I was raised
without any religion.

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,960
As a matter of fact,
I used to get Jesus and Santa Confused

4
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:21,860
when I was a child.
So I was raised without religion.

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,060
And um,
I,

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,710
I didn't go to school.
I mean,

7
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,340
I didn't go to high school.
I didn't go to junior high school for

8
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:30,110
any length of time.
So I,

9
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:32,840
um,
and then at a very early age,

10
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:36,510
I was plunged into this extraordinary,
uh,

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,070
living situation when I was a,
uh,

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,530
when my mother gave me to her,
her psychiatrist and his family to live.

13
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:47,531
So my sexual orientation was nothing I
ever questioned or struggled with or

14
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:53,171
thought about it just why I'm right
handed I'm right handed and it's just a

15
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:55,040
fact,
you know.

16
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,720
So being gay was exactly the same thing.

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,820
It was just a fact.
And it's always been like that for me in

18
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:01,070
my career all my life.
I never,

19
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:02,190
um,
I,

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,990
I've never,
um,

21
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,250
I've never been something I struggled
with.

22
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:07,511
You know,
I've,

23
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:10,760
I've been asked and I've actually been
criticized by some people in who have

24
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:13,730
misinterpreted when asked by the gay
press,

25
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:15,890
are you proud to be gay?
I have often reply.

26
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:18,980
I'm not proud because I haven't
accomplished anything.

27
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,880
If I were,
if I had been the child of Evangelical

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,220
Christian parents,
I'd be damn proud.

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,070
You know,
if I had worked for my identity,

30
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:29,090
I would be proud.
But,

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,330
you know,
I never did.

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,390
I do,
you know,

33
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,420
I'm proud of the,
um,

34
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,270
the game,
the lesbian people who came before me

35
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,290
and made it possible for me to take it
for granted,

36
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,450
you know,
but I myself haven't really,

37
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,070
um,
haven't struggled and overcome anything

38
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,880
and I'm not proud of being right handed.
Now at the same time what I would I

39
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:53,570
change and be straight if I could never,
never,

40
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,570
no interest would never do it,
never do it.

41
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,910
So I'm really happy,
you know this way,

42
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,590
but it's not like I accomplished
something.

43
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:04,940
I took her driver's test and passed.
I was just born knowing how to drive.
