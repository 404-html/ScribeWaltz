1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,730
The mind is a brain that's conscious.
Consciousness is a synonym for

2
00:00:03,731 --> 00:00:07,150
subjectivity,
and there's a conceptual gap between

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,990
subjectivity and objective observation,
which is what science is.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,100
I would actually maintain that there is
no scientific way to demonstrate that an

5
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:19,420
entity is conscious.
It's only a parent to itself,

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,920
and my prediction is that we will.
This is an objective prediction.

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,030
We will come to accept entities that are
not biological,

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,890
uh,
as conscious,

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,960
but it's not going to be okay machines
on the right side of the room.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,270
Humans on the left,
if you talked to your biological human,

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,390
that they will have lots of non
biological processes going on in their

12
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:43,480
body and brain.
Those computers will be out in the

13
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:47,500
cloud.
So the thinking of that person isn't

14
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:51,550
even just in their body and brain.
Even in the non biological portion,

15
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,310
it's out on the cloud.
So it's going to be all mixed up.

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,160
It's not going to be a clear distinction
between human and machine.

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,730
The bottom line is we are one human
machine civilization.

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,820
This technology is already expanded who
we are,

19
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:07,630
and it's going to go into high gear when
we get to the steep part of the

20
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:08,410
exponential.
