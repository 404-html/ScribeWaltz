1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,100
I think that the importance of
businesses social role is growing very,

2
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:20,770
very rapidly and there's only going to
continue to expand.

3
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,470
Um,
I think there will come a time in the

4
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:27,910
very near future within five to eight
years when almost every single major

5
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,270
company will simply have to pick up the
social glove and acknowledge what their

6
00:00:33,611 --> 00:00:38,611
social role contribution footprint is.
They won't be able to bolt it on and

7
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:41,981
say,
hey,

8
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:44,410
we're a good company.
Or say,

9
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,840
Hey,
please talk to my csr,

10
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:49,330
Executive Mike,
a corporate social responsibility.

11
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,570
It will executive.
It will get more and more important and

12
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:57,571
more and more wired into the DNA of
organizations of why for two really

13
00:00:58,031 --> 00:00:59,230
important reasons.
One,

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,680
consumers and employees are demanding
it,

15
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:06,490
particularly most notably millennials
who want to work for companies that are

16
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:09,820
making a difference and who simply won't
devote their time or invest their energy

17
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:13,210
and companies that are not,
or in companies that pretend to be an

18
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:15,070
aren't really,
um,

19
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,070
so and consumers are going to vote
increasingly,

20
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:23,071
particularly if we continue on this sea
of disillusionment with this massive app

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,730
disillusioned with our government in the
face of a massive advocation of

22
00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:28,564
stewardship.

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,510
As consumers get more and more
disillusioned with government,

24
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,530
they're more and more interested to use
other avenues to vote with their dollars

25
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:39,670
or vote with their feet or make a
positive difference in a world in which

26
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:42,610
that difference is so important.
So the first reason is consumers and

27
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:47,050
employees are demanding it.
Second reason is the world.

28
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:50,290
The planet,
the collective global village can't

29
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:55,291
really survive the next 20 years and
sustain itself without the knowledge,

30
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,660
the resources,
the power of business and businesses.

31
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,890
Social problems are now business
problem.

32
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:04,481
So,
you know,

33
00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:07,510
Samuel Johnson once said,
nothing so focused as a man's thoughts

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,190
like the prospect of hanging well with
the environmental system.

35
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:16,570
And the global financial system,
we have two very important ticking time

36
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:20,980
bombs and and there are many others that
flow out of that are that are there that

37
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:23,290
are part of the global,
if you will,

38
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,340
challenges ahead.

39
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,730
But we simply cannot navigate those
challenges.

40
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,780
We can't solve the problems.
We can't build a sustainable future for

41
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:34,360
our kids,
much less our grandkids if we don't have

42
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,210
a have business.
Very,

43
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,110
very involved literally out the social
at the village,

44
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,230
at the school level.
And so I think that that the social role

45
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:48,040
of business,
it,

46
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,380
it,
it is an enormous issue.

47
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,260
But I think finally the lot of
companies,

48
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:57,040
particularly large banks right now in
the wake of the last year and a half,

49
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:02,070
and then the wake of what many of us
think of an astounding behavior on the

50
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:05,620
part of banking executives.
I think large banks are hustling to find

51
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:09,850
good bolt on for their social
citizenship and their social role.

52
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,920
And I also.
And so I think bolt bolt-ons add on.

53
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,340
Let me brush up but tarnished reputation
by throwing money at x or y.

54
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:25,840
cause I think consumers and lots of
other folks are real quick to pick that

55
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:30,340
up and to and to call a spade a spade
and see it for exactly what it is.
