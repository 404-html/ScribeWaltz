1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,170
Is Peter White and I teach in the
mathematics department at Columbia

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,910
University,
or my title is senior lecturer.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,270
Well,
the first thing I'd say is that when

4
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:19,610
people set talk about string theory,
they're actually talking about a very

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,000
complex set of ideas that um,
lots of people,

6
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:24,410
you know,
very large amount people have worked on

7
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:26,540
and done a lot of different things with
the,

8
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:30,170
um,
the probably what it's best known for

9
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:32,780
and what got people all excited about it
and the physics community is,

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,650
there's kind of like the conjecture that
instead of at the most fundamental level

11
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,950
you can understand matter in the
universe in,

12
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,730
in terms not of point particles.
Uh,

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,100
which is the way our best theories
currently you kind of understand things.

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,110
But in terms of kind of vibrating,
if you like vibrating kind of loops of

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,870
some elementary objects,
so you're at your elementary object

16
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:56,510
instead of being a point like thing is
something you should think of more as

17
00:00:56,511 --> 00:00:59,990
being a one dimensional loop or a kind
of string string,

18
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:01,160
which is kind of moving around.

19
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,550
So it has a lot more,
um,

20
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,830
it can do a lot more complicated things
than a point.

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,940
This is kind of loop of elementary
matter,

22
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,580
whatever it is.
And so it,

23
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,560
it gives you a
very different kind of class of,

24
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,830
of theories and then the ones that,
um,

25
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,110
we've been so successful with before and
the,

26
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,000
the,
the cafe.

27
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,750
So during the 60s that this idea was
initially developed and initially people

28
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:29,000
tried to do one thing with these class
of theories,

29
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,730
something which didn't work out that
well.

30
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,450
And then starting in the late seventies
and eighties,

31
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:36,570
people then,
um,

32
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,760
came up with the conjecture that maybe
you really could unify all of physics

33
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:44,690
and solve some of the open problems in
physics by replacing our standard

34
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,390
theories.
Maybe we call the standard model with

35
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,570
some kind of string theory.
And that's so,

36
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:54,110
so since this idea,
it became very popular in 1984 and so

37
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:55,460
it's been now 25 years.

38
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,870
People have been working very hard on
that.

39
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:57,704
And,
uh,

40
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,690
and,
and I think just the initial thing,

41
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:02,380
I've got people very excited,
at least I would claim,

42
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:03,890
you know,
really hasn't worked out and really

43
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:06,020
can't work out.
And that's kind of been,

44
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,610
I think a lot of the reason controversy
has been an argument over this issue of,

45
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:11,421
you know,
whether this,

46
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:13,850
um,
for a speculative idea about whether you

47
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:17,810
can use the strings to develop,
to get a unified theory about whether

48
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:19,610
that really has,
is that,

49
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:22,010
is that an idea that's failed or is
there still some hope for it?

50
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:23,110
I think that's really the,
uh,

51
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,180
what's the,
the controversial part of it?

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,060
Well,
the main thing to understand about the

53
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:36,810
current state of physics is that we have
in some sense kind of a victim of our

54
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:39,330
own success.
We have an incredibly successful theory

55
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,310
called the standard model.
And it,

56
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,300
um,
it,

57
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,730
it really explains everything that we
can observe about,

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,950
um,
in terms of a fairly small number of

59
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,560
elementary particles and some basic
forces between them.

60
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,380
And it's a,
it's a quite beautiful theory ended.

61
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,130
Um,
it really just kind of absurdly

62
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:59,680
successful every experiment,
anybody knows how to do that in

63
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:01,140
principle can be,
um,

64
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,030
did that,
this theory has something to say about

65
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,351
it.
It works.

66
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,480
It works out perfectly,
you know,

67
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,890
to,
to whatever experimental,

68
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,430
um,
in whenever you need,

69
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:14,200
how you can do an experiment to whatever
precision.

70
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:16,240
And it comes out exactly as predicted by
this model.

71
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,060
So we have kind of a semi unified
theory.

72
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,100
This,
we have this quite nice,

73
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,650
beautiful structure,
which explains everything we can see.

74
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,210
But it still,
it still leaves open.

75
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:31,000
So several questions and um,
some of the questions are just to kind

76
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,020
of why,
you know,

77
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:34,180
we have all these different particles,
they all have different masses.

78
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,870
Why do they all have different masses?
We don't understand why the electron has

79
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,870
a certain mass quirks of other masses.
So,

80
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,230
so they're just kind of things which the
theory just doesn't address.

81
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:47,230
It just doesn't answer these questions.
And they're questions that,

82
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:49,210
which has physicists we think there
should be answers to.

83
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,590
But then there's also one kind of
remaining forest,

84
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,300
which isn't part of the standard model,
which is the four,

85
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,820
which is the gravitational force.
And the,

86
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,660
um,
the gravitational force is much,

87
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:03,840
much weaker than these other forces.
And it's,

88
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:05,410
it,
it has a somewhat different nature.

89
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,350
So it,
the problem with it is that we don't,

90
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:11,240
um,
w w the,

91
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:11,590
the,
the,

92
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,380
these other forces that we have
something which is a quantum theory.

93
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,790
It really,
it's,

94
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,600
it's quantum mechanics.
It really works down to the microscopic

95
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:21,970
level.
And in terms of this very fundamental

96
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,760
idea about,
about reality called quantum mechanics,

97
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,140
the theory of gravity that we still use
is Einstein's theory of general

98
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:31,180
relativity.
And it's what we call a classical

99
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:33,040
theory.
It's not a quantum mechanical theory.

100
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,593
And the,
um,

101
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,820
you can make an estimate.
The problem is that you can make an

102
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:40,210
estimate within this theory of how big
quantum mechanical effects would be.

103
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,360
And that estimate tells you that they're
just so absurdly small.

104
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:46,720
You can never hope to see them.
So there's kind of a problem with

105
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:47,800
principal.
We had this theory,

106
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:50,200
which is not a proper quantum mechanical
theory.

107
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,490
And we know that there's things which it
can't quite properly explained,

108
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:56,090
but there,
there's,

109
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,010
they're far too small for us to study
them and to,

110
00:04:58,011 --> 00:04:58,480
to,
to,

111
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,840
to try to see them.
So we would anyways.

112
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:03,430
So it's,
we're not completely happy with this

113
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:04,360
setup.
We have a,

114
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,580
a force which doesn't quite fit with the
others and uh,

115
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,600
which for logical reasons that we would
like to unify it with these others and

116
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,900
think and understand it as a quantum
mechanical theory and,

117
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:16,080
uh,
we've never quite been successful and

118
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,080
able to do that.
And,

119
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,670
and this is what strict string theory
was.

120
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:21,100
It was kind of a promise of a way of how
to do that.

121
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,070
And uh,
anyway,

122
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,420
that's kind of that,
that's why people got so excited.

123
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,220
Yeah.
It's Kinda,

124
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:32,770
it's kind of a famous phrase among
physicists.

125
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:35,020
It goes back to a,
and there's a well known theorist called

126
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,620
Wolfgang Pauli and the in the 50s
stories that towards the end of his

127
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:39,454
life,
someone,

128
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,540
I guess he goes,
he was well known for being a very kind

129
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,590
of hyper critical of,
of,

130
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,000
of,
of,

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,100
of things that were going on.
And we'll get up the middle of a seminar

132
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:48,940
and started saying,
you know,

133
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:50,920
it's wrong.
It's completely wrong.

134
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,760
And late in his life,
someone asked him about some work that

135
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:57,130
was some of some,
some speculative idea of someone and

136
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,000
heavily he shook his head and said,
well,

137
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,380
that one's not even wrong.
And,

138
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,870
and so the,
uh,

139
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,940
it,
it's,

140
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,300
it's,
it's a well known phrase among

141
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:08,050
physicists and it kind of carries I
think two,

142
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,090
two meanings.
I mean,

143
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,800
w w one one of them is just kind of a
more somewhat of a term of abuse.

144
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,401
Well,
that's so bad.

145
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,480
It's not even wrong,
but,

146
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:19,940
but there's a more interesting,
and there's also more kind of technical

147
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,830
meaning that
a very often used,

148
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,780
you have respect,
you have expected of idea.

149
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,000
And if it's,
if it's not a very good idea or it turns

150
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:34,430
out you actually can't even,
you end up not being able to do very

151
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:36,410
much with it,
you end up not being able to,

152
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,370
um,
to predict anything with it or to,

153
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,780
to,
or it's just not useful.

154
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,380
So there's also a notion of not being
not even wrong in the sense that it's

155
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:49,460
not an idea which can be fully developed
or it can turn into something which is

156
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:51,960
powerful enough to actually predict
something and be wrong.

157
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,340
So this one problem is string theory is
that it's kind of a I theory,

158
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:00,080
which they could explain what the
problems are,

159
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:04,520
but the problems are such that you can
ever even pin it down and say this is

160
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:06,530
exactly what it predicts and let's go
out and test it.

161
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:10,970
So it's not even capable of being wrong,
being wrong or being falsified are being

162
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:14,030
shown to be wrong.
So that's the more relevant meaning

163
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:14,864
here.
Really.

164
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,870
I said,
I mean it's string theory is actually a

165
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:24,050
very complicated stories.
So they're,

166
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:24,461
they're,
they're,

167
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:26,690
you know,
if you start out with this hypothesis

168
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:29,780
that maybe you're are,
our fundamental objects are not points,

169
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:32,000
but are these strings,
there's a lot of different things you

170
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,310
can try and do that you can,
you,

171
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:34,670
you,
you have a whole different class of

172
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:37,340
theories you can play with.
And so I think a lot of,

173
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,970
if you look at what most people who are
still doing string theory doing,

174
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,720
they're actually not directly trying to,
um,

175
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,450
to develop as unified theory anymore.
They're off kind of doing other things

176
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:54,680
with string theory there that people
these days are trying to apply it to um,

177
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,920
to problems and nuclear physics.
They're applying it to problems and,

178
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:59,420
um,
in solid state physics,

179
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,790
understanding superconductors.
So they're,

180
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,520
the people who still are interested in
it,

181
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:04,891
you know,
are,

182
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:07,190
are,
are often kind of,

183
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,850
even if they will,
they may or may not explicitly admit

184
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:13,040
that they've kind of given up on the
unified theory idea,

185
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,540
but they're,
they're often doing other things.

186
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,920
So there's a,
there's a very active,

187
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,100
um,
pursuit of string theory in,

188
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,350
you know,
with other applications that don't have

189
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:23,750
any to do with unification.
It's also turned out to be very

190
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:25,100
interesting.
And in mathematics,

191
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:26,810
there's a very,
one of the things that I'm most

192
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:30,770
interested in is the intersection
between mathematics and physics and um,

193
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,970
the way the two fields kind of affect
each other and ideas from physics lead

194
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:36,410
to very interesting things in
mathematics,

195
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,470
ideas and mathematics get used and they
give us new physics.

196
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,860
And string theory has been very,
very fruitful in terms of raising

197
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:45,020
questions,
which I'm happy to have led to very

198
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:47,870
interesting mathematics.
So there's a very active field of

199
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,930
research given between math and physics
in string theory,

200
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:52,221
but,
but it,

201
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:55,070
but it just doesn't seem to be relevant
to this question of unification.

202
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,450
Yeah,
I certainly shouldn't.

203
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,330
My critical criticism of string theory
is not that,

204
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,081
well,
you know,

205
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:07,530
if you guys would just realize that you
should be doing such and such,

206
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:09,030
that would,
that would solve a lot of problems.

207
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,320
I don't actually,
yeah,

208
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,510
I don't think that I have some my own
ideas,

209
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,520
which I'm very excited by,
which at which I'm pursuing,

210
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:19,290
which are also new ideas about how to
use mathematics to do things in physics,

211
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,600
which don't have anything to do with
string theory.

212
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:21,901
And,
and,

213
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:24,510
and,
which kind of at least lead me to see

214
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:25,000
you there.
You know,

215
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,570
there's a lot of areas,
a lot of things we don't understand

216
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,690
which are closer to are the standard
model which we,

217
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,730
which we do know works.
There's a lot of kind of mathematical

218
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,780
mathematical structure behind the,
um,

219
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,720
the standard model,
which is still kind of mysterious and

220
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:42,900
which is not well understood.
And I think pursuing that is more likely

221
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:46,680
to get us somewhere then the districts
or unification idea,

222
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,240
just because you're starting from
something which,

223
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:50,400
you know,
a theory which you know is right.

224
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,060
And trying to further develop your
understanding of that theory is maybe a

225
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,880
more fruitful thing to do.
Then I'm trying to,

226
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:57,870
you know,
just kinda throw out,

227
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,820
throw the,
throw all that out and start a fresh

228
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:02,330
with something more speculative.
The,

229
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:05,400
um,
I guess it gets one thing to talk about

230
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:05,911
is,
is the,

231
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:06,631
uh,
this,

232
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:09,770
uh,
what's happening in Geneva even that,

233
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,531
this,
this month,

234
00:10:10,531 --> 00:10:11,331
that,
and so the,

235
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:12,240
uh,
a lot of the,

236
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,210
a lot of the problem with the field,
as I've said,

237
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:17,220
is this business of being a victim of
our own success,

238
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:20,520
not having any experimental results of
disagree with the theory,

239
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,640
which makes it very,
very hard to figure out how to,

240
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,800
how do you improve a theory if you've
got no kind of clues as to what,

241
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,523
you know,
what,

242
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:30,931
what,
what,

243
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,850
what might possibly be wrong that it
needs to be,

244
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,810
needs to be changed.

245
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,130
And so there's a,
this accelerator called the LHC okay.

246
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:42,180
At cern in Geneva.
And it's been in development for quite a

247
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,830
few years now.
And it's been a long process getting it

248
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:45,960
working.
But just over the past month,

249
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:50,040
they've finally got it to inject beams
into this accelerator and start

250
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,290
colliding these beams and start doing
some new physics.

251
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,430
And over the next year,
they'll start raising the energy of this

252
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:58,650
accelerator to the point where we'll,
um,

253
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,200
we'll,
we'll be in in a new energy regime

254
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:02,910
where,
which allows us to,

255
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:03,744
uh,
to,

256
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,260
to get experimental data about what's
happening at higher energy,

257
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,080
which also coat,
which corresponds to what's happening at

258
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:13,800
shorter and shorter distances to um,
to see what's happening in shortage.

259
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:16,380
Shorter distances.
In some sense you need to use shorter

260
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:19,260
and shorter wavelength or higher and
higher energy probes.

261
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,483
And this,
uh,

262
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,460
this new accelerator,
you know,

263
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,390
pr finally promises some data in this
new energy range beyond what we've been

264
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:28,440
able to see so far.

265
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,600
And there,
there are reasons to believe that this

266
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:33,480
new energy range is one where,
um,

267
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,180
that we can actually start to get
answers to some of these questions

268
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:37,380
about,
especially about mass,

269
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:39,150
about why,
why did different particles have

270
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:41,260
different masses?
Um,

271
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,091
so,
so,

272
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:47,280
so,
so the state of the standard model is

273
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:49,830
that it's as quite beautiful theory,
but you,

274
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:52,530
um,
to make the whole thing work,

275
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,060
you need a,
you need,

276
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,430
you need to make sure that a certain
kind of physical phenomenon.

277
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:01,990
It has to happen basically in one way of
saying it is that the theory has certain

278
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:03,420
symmetry is,
um,

279
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,170
and,
and the,

280
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,660
the lowest tenant,
the lowest energy theory,

281
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,440
the lowest energy state,
the vacuum of the theory has to have

282
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,990
nontrivial properties under one of the
cemeteries.

283
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,870
It can't normally you say vacuum state.
It's just kind of completely and

284
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,020
interesting.
And if you rotate it around,

285
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:21,370
move it around the vacuum,
nature can't,

286
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:22,090
nothing can happen.

287
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,950
It's just a vacuum state.
But,

288
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,190
um,
but the vacuum actually has to have

289
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:30,820
interesting properties under these kinds
of mathematical symmetry transformations

290
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:33,280
and the so,
so,

291
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:36,010
so we know that that has to be true in
order to make the theory work.

292
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,440
And there,
there are many ways you can imagine,

293
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,710
um,
making that happen.

294
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:43,690
And,
and one way is called the higgs,

295
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,590
the higgs mechanism.
And so the higgs mechanism involves a

296
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:52,570
postulating the existence of some,
some new fields and new kind of matter,

297
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,550
which is this,
this higgs part,

298
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,780
this,
this higgs field.

299
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,003
And,
um,

300
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,200
and,
and then giving this,

301
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,880
that he did the dynamics for the making
the properties of the higgs field such

302
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:04,840
that the,
that,

303
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,250
that the,
in the vacuum state,

304
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:08,770
the higgs field,
we'll have this done trivial property.

305
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,280
So you can do that in some sentence.
The higgs field is kind of the simplest

306
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,720
way of getting what you want,
but when you do it,

307
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,040
you also,
um,

308
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:22,770
you,
you,

309
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,141
you,
you,

310
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:25,570
you end up losing the ability to predict
all sorts of things.

311
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,180
Cause then if some,
then there's the question of why,

312
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,781
why did,
why does the party,

313
00:13:29,781 --> 00:13:32,080
we'll have a certain mass just becomes,
well,

314
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:35,350
because that's how strong,
it's how strongly it interacts with the

315
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:36,970
higgs field.
So you,

316
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,390
it's a simplest way of making something
happen.

317
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:41,500
You know,
it has to happen,

318
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,813
but it,
it,

319
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,360
it,
it,

320
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,050
it's a way which has a lot of things.
You don't really like it,

321
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,470
it's not a very satisfactory way of
doing it because it kind of of

322
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:52,420
necessity.
Then it leaves open a whole range of

323
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:54,820
questions and questions,
what you would hope to have answers to,

324
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:57,940
but you just from,
you just can't answer it that way.

325
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,690
So one thing which we hope to learn from
the LHC is,

326
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,860
is this higgs mechanism or does this
higgs field really there?

327
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,223
Um,
in,

328
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,640
in which case that,
that'll,

329
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,250
that'll be actually somewhat of a
disappointment because it'll mean that,

330
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,440
okay,
this theory kind of continues to work

331
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:15,790
and we don't,
we,

332
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,050
we still don't know how to answer some
of these questions or I think that the

333
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,330
much more exciting possibility is going
to be that there's some,

334
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:25,270
some,
something else causing this phenomenon

335
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:28,120
of the,
of the vacuum behaving this way.

336
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,010
And,
uh,

337
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,970
and,
and there's something else would be a,

338
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:31,551
you know,
give us,

339
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:33,220
um,
what would be,

340
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,050
it would be something which would be
more interesting and we'll,

341
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:37,420
and we'll allow answers to these
questions.

342
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,120
So instead,
so this whole,

343
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:41,680
this,
this name of the Higgs field and finding

344
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,150
the higgs particle,
that's kind of a,

345
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,090
it's an over simplified way of saying
what,

346
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:47,020
what,
what we're really hoping,

347
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:50,230
which is we're really hoping to
understand what is causing the vacuum to

348
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:51,770
behave this way.
And,

349
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:53,180
uh,
and,

350
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,420
and we have good reason there.
There's,

351
00:14:54,421 --> 00:14:57,650
there's kind of a number in the theory
which kind of says how big this

352
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,320
phenomenon going on in the vacuum is.
And,

353
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:02,600
um,
and what the size of it is.

354
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,910
And the size is exactly the size that
this,

355
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:06,680
uh,
this accelerator should finally be able

356
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:07,780
to probe.
So there's,

357
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,170
there,
there it's not,

358
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:10,880
um,
there's a very good reason to believe

359
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:13,790
that this is the right machine to kind
of start answering some of these

360
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:14,624
questions.

361
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:23,000
The real problem is that the,
the ways that we knew that there are

362
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,980
various ways,
a lot of people have studied a lot of

363
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:27,260
other alternatives to the Higgs field,
which I'm,

364
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,560
the problem is that they're all fairly
complicated and none of them,

365
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:34,300
they all have as bad or even worst
problem is in that the higgs field,

366
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,480
they've all,
so none of them are convincing.

367
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,240
We don't have the convincing alternative
to it.

368
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,040
And,
and I don't either.

369
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,610
I guess,
I mean the one about all I can say about

370
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:46,620
that is that the,
there I,

371
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,860
I'm very interested in,
in,

372
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,140
in some of the kind of mathematical
parts of the theory that we don't

373
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:54,050
understand and some of the kind of deep
mathematical structure that we don't

374
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:55,580
understand in our,
in these theories.

375
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,420
And part of what we don't understand it
and in these theories actually is,

376
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,570
you know,
is related to this problem of,

377
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:05,060
of the vacuum of this behavior,
of the vacuum.

378
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,270
So,
I mean in my ideal world it would turn

379
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,160
out that there's,
there's,

380
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:15,380
there's something there,
there's something still to be learned

381
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:17,270
about the mathematical structure of
these theories,

382
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,400
which would in the end,
you know,

383
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,930
explain this,
this higgs,

384
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,390
this higgs phenomenon,
this is problem with the vacuum.

385
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:24,440
But,
but I mean I,

386
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,090
I wish I knew how to do that,
but I certainly don't have a UN has a

387
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,580
very big reasons to believe are there.
That's an interesting thing to look at.

388
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:32,031
But,
but I,

389
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:36,320
I certainly don't have an answer to it.
And I think I get,

390
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:38,060
if I had to assign probabilities,
who had what,

391
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:41,130
I would a guess is that the,
I'd say there's about a 50% chance the

392
00:16:41,131 --> 00:16:46,131
lhc will actually see an actual higgs
particle and there will be a,

393
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,270
there is some kind of higgs field and
that this is going to be kind of

394
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:53,780
depressing for us because it means,
well,

395
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:55,370
whenever there is this field there,
it's,

396
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:57,860
it's,
it's working like this and the answer

397
00:16:57,861 --> 00:17:01,430
these questions,
we would like answers to our,

398
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:05,480
you'd have to go even higher energies or
a smaller distances to understand them.

399
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,870
And,
or there's,

400
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,620
there's,
I think there's a 50% probability we'll

401
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,720
find that we won't see a higgs particle,
or at least not a higgs particle,

402
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:12,970
the kind,
um,

403
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,030
that,
that you see in the simplest model and,

404
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,840
and that,
and that will actually give us clues as

405
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:20,220
to what's really going on.
And that will be much more exciting.

406
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,430
So,
but I don't know which is going to

407
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,264
happen.

408
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,840
You never know.
I mean there's no reason that you,

409
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:32,360
um,
the general problem that with particle

410
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:35,130
physics is that the,
these questions we're asking are at,

411
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,730
you know,
they're having such high energy scales

412
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:42,590
are such short distances that it's um,
it's very hard to see how to do anything

413
00:17:42,591 --> 00:17:43,850
very practical with this.
I mean,

414
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:47,360
anything like these partners we're
talking about,

415
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:49,560
you know,
I have often have have lifetimes which

416
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:50,394
are,
you know,

417
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,710
10 to the minus 20 seconds or,
I mean they're,

418
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:53,011
they're,
they're,

419
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:55,800
they're just,
if you produce a higgs particle,

420
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:59,490
it's going to be so short lived it,
it's incredibly difficult to even see

421
00:17:59,491 --> 00:18:01,410
any evidence of the thing.
It's not something you'd be able to go

422
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:05,250
out and use these higgs particles to
carry around and do something with it.

423
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,683
On the other hand,
I mean,

424
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,970
you,
you don't really know what you're going

425
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:08,340
to find it.

426
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,470
If you do find,
especially if you find something,

427
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,420
I guess I,
I could say it this way,

428
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,900
if you do just find this higgs particle
and just this higgs field,

429
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,710
it's very hard to debate to do anything
really practical with that.

430
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:21,390
If you,
if you find something completely new

431
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,090
understanding of this theory,
then who,

432
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:25,620
who knows?
I mean you can conject clay come up with

433
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,810
all sorts of models.
You can come up with models in which

434
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,620
there's kind of new heavy,
long lived particles which you could

435
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:33,180
then imagine doing things with.
But um,

436
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,580
I think it is probably a pretty good bet
that within the near future,

437
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:40,290
this is not really a big way of
practical.

438
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,550
This is really a matter of I'm just
trying to understand the world better

439
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:44,180
and not,
not,

440
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,480
not as many as,
not in a way,

441
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,620
but not in a way that's particularly
going to be useful for her for doing

442
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:51,750
anything too practical.
It's going to affect people anytime

443
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:52,584
soon.

444
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:02,220
I mean some of that is because people,
one of the alternatives to this is this

445
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,920
higgs mechanism is it,
and people started studying.

446
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,850
It sets out some models in which,
well,

447
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,710
to go back a little bit,
I mean one thing about string theory and

448
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:16,980
string theory,
to make string theory work,

449
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:20,100
you have to have extra dimensions.
You have to have more than a three space

450
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:23,220
and one time dimensions and that,
then that's kind of an in some sense,

451
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:28,221
the main problem with it with string
theory that you have to it,

452
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,740
you have to have at least five extra
dimensions.

453
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,731
I start,
sorry,

454
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:34,650
six extra dimensions.
And,

455
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,490
um,
the,

456
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,150
the,
the predictions of the theory and being

457
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:41,490
able to use it for anything depending on
what's happening,

458
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:44,490
at least six extra dimensions.
And that's no one has ever,

459
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,070
initially,
the hope was that there was a fairly

460
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,920
small number of consistent ways of
dealing with these extra dimensions and

461
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:50,754
that would,
uh,

462
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,740
you know,
make this a predictive theory,

463
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:54,300
but it has turned out they're just too
much.

464
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,170
You can do and you can kind of get
anything you want by having these extra

465
00:19:58,171 --> 00:20:00,980
dimensions to different things.
And so one,

466
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:05,550
one thing as part of this,
one thing that people studied was models

467
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:09,610
in which these extra dimensions are
actually of the executive,

468
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:12,960
the right size that the Lhd,
you should start seeing evidence of

469
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:17,640
these extra dimensions and then
producing black holes because it,

470
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,680
because of these extra dimensions and
that say,

471
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:21,930
um,
there's just never really been a reason

472
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:24,090
to believe that these extra dimensions
would,

473
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,330
we'd see no evidence of them at our best
accelerators now.

474
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:31,740
And we'd go up by a factor of seven and
energy and all of a sudden all these

475
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:33,210
extra benches would appear.
There's just,

476
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,520
there's,
there's absolutely no reason for that to

477
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:37,320
be,
to happen.

478
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,330
It's you,
you can make specked it a model in which

479
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:41,160
it happens,
but first of all,

480
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,090
then anyways,
so there's,

481
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:45,480
there's really kind of no Ma no good
motivation for these models and for them

482
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:47,530
to happen and no evidence for them.

483
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,590
And then even if they were to exist when
they did happen,

484
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,410
any such black holes would kind of
immediately,

485
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,360
um,
it'd be kind of completely unstable and

486
00:20:56,361 --> 00:20:57,640
what,
it would just immediately decay into

487
00:20:57,641 --> 00:20:58,810
something else.
So you wouldn't,

488
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,290
you're not going to produce a,
a dangerous black hole that way,

489
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,101
but,
but,

490
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:04,150
but,
but the first kind of,

491
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,800
I think what caused all this trouble is
that

492
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,040
people kind of wanted to,
to,

493
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,750
um,
to promote these extra dimensional

494
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:13,060
models even though there was no good
motivation for them.

495
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,160
And so they promoted them by saying,
well,

496
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:16,510
in principle,
you know,

497
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:18,790
since we don't know what happens at
higher energies,

498
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,440
the Lhc,
maybe evidence,

499
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:23,500
these extra mentions will show up,
but there's no good reason for that.

500
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:25,180
So,
but once people started promoting the

501
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:26,590
idea of these extra dimensions of my
job,

502
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,850
then people are like,
wow,

503
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,890
if they show up,
then maybe there'll be black holes.

504
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:33,420
And it was kind of a speculation on top
of speculation on how to speculation.

505
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,950
But it's all,
it's all suffered.

506
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,340
There's has been,
has no reason to believe that any such

507
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:40,060
thing could,
could,

508
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,990
could possibly be true.

509
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,940
The thing that most fascinates me about
this whole subject is,

510
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,860
is something that,
that,

511
00:21:51,861 --> 00:21:53,230
that promise,
it quickly gets very technical.

512
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:53,631
But,
but there,

513
00:21:53,631 --> 00:21:55,840
there's a,
there's some,

514
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:57,240
there's,
there's an area of mathematics which is

515
00:21:57,241 --> 00:22:00,850
known as representation theory.
And from when,

516
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,430
when I thinking and it's thinking about
it is in terms of what are,

517
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,410
what physicists were often called
symmetries.

518
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,880
So,
so for instance,

519
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:10,090
one of the basic facts about the laws of
nature is that they're,

520
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,950
um,
they're,

521
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,410
they're symmetric.
Laws of nature are the same at,

522
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,000
you know,
if you move,

523
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,000
if you move in any direction,
are you moving time back and forth?

524
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,870
The Laws of physics don't change.
If you rotate things around in three

525
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:24,790
dimensions,
the laws of physics don't change.

526
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,460
And so,
so the,

527
00:22:26,461 --> 00:22:30,410
the so called symmetries and um,
and these,

528
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,320
these,
these cemeteries have very important,

529
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:34,600
um,
physical implications.

530
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,670
So friends,
the fact that the laws of physics don't

531
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:40,960
change as if you change your,
if you move in time,

532
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,470
has physical implication that,
that there's this thing called energy

533
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:48,370
and energy is conserved.
And same thing that and the fact that

534
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,610
laws of physics don't change.
If you move back and forth in different

535
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:54,400
directions in space implies that there's
a,

536
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:57,010
um,
something called momentum and momentum

537
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:59,340
is conserved and doesn't change and as
you move,

538
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,830
as you evolve in time.
And so,

539
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:04,240
so these very,
very fundamental facts about physics are

540
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:07,060
kind of deeply grounded in the
symmetries of,

541
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:11,470
of nature.
And so to a mathematician,

542
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:11,831
this,
this,

543
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:14,050
this question is,
um,

544
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,500
is a question about what we call about
groups and representations of these

545
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:20,470
groups.
So if you go into any math department

546
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:22,620
and look at what they're doing,
you'll see that you know that a lot,

547
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,920
a lot of people and different kinds of
mathematics are studying different

548
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:28,900
structures,
which are all so called groups.

549
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,660
And they're often when studying what are
called representations of these groups.

550
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,380
So even people setting num number theory
kind of abstract things about,

551
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,670
about prime numbers or something,
they're also studying groups and certain

552
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:40,930
representations,
these groups.

553
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,200
So there's kind of a,
to the extent that mathematics has a

554
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,740
kind of a unifying theme and a unifying
principle which shows up in different

555
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:51,580
areas of mathematics.
It's about this row,

556
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,380
this,
these representations and representation

557
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:58,960
theory.
And the thing that most strike when the

558
00:23:58,961 --> 00:24:00,950
most of the things that most strikes me
out physics and was fascinating to me

559
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:03,110
about it is that if you look at quantum
mechanics,

560
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,860
quantum mechanics initially it looks
like a very odd structure.

561
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:09,330
It doesn't,
it's not something that we can,

562
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:12,440
we have any kind of intuitive
understanding of it doesn't look like,

563
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,500
um,
you know,

564
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,900
like what the way we're used to thinking
about physics based on everyday

565
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:18,734
experience.

566
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,710
But if you look at the mathematical
structure and the basic structures of

567
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,740
quantum mechanics,
they're exactly the structures that show

568
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:27,620
up in this theory,
in this theory of representations.

569
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,630
So there's a kind of a deep
relation between math and physics,

570
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:36,950
which is surrounding this whole notion
of symmetries and representations of

571
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:38,410
symmetries.
So,

572
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,830
so that's,
so that's one thing that's always

573
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:42,980
fascinated me and,
and my own research,

574
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:47,540
my own interest is,
is in kind of developing t taking a lot

575
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:49,520
that's been learned in mathematics.
There's a lot that's been learned in

576
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:53,510
mathematics over the years about how to
think about representations and how to

577
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:55,460
construct them and how to work with
them.

578
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,930
Some of it has made its way into physics
had been using in physics and,

579
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:02,810
and was using a physics since the early
days of quantum mechanics.

580
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,003
And,
um,

581
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,410
so for instance,
one of the great kind of to the extent

582
00:25:06,411 --> 00:25:07,660
there is a,
uh,

583
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,590
a kind of hero of this book I wrote
about this.

584
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,560
It's a mathematician and called the
Herrmann vial who was a special,

585
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:16,580
who kind of was one of the first people
to understand how quantum mechanics work

586
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,400
and to understand the relation to
representations.

587
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:20,721
But,
but,

588
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:21,091
but I,
I,

589
00:25:21,091 --> 00:25:21,741
anyway,
I think there,

590
00:25:21,741 --> 00:25:25,400
there's still a lot to be learned and
that way and raised specifically the so

591
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:28,340
called standard model has this group of
symmetries which is called the gauge

592
00:25:28,341 --> 00:25:33,341
symmetry and it's an influential group
and the standard kind of physics

593
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:39,500
conjecture or understanding of the
representations that this group is that

594
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:41,900
there is that that should not be an
interesting question.

595
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,600
There should only be a trivial
representation of this group.

596
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,810
But anyway,
my conjecture is that there's,

597
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,600
there's actually a much more interesting
question there.

598
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:51,410
And,
uh,

599
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,950
and pursuing that you can,
pursuing this question of how do you

600
00:25:54,951 --> 00:25:58,280
deal with the,
with the gauge symmetry of this theory

601
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:01,940
and in terms of using ideas from
representation theory that are,

602
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,670
um,
that are more well known in mathematics

603
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:05,900
that haven't been used in physics
before,

604
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:09,740
that you can actually get somewhere.
So that's maybe a bit too technical,

605
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:12,380
but that's about as good as I can do
with this.

606
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,310
So it's hard to say and there's,
um,

607
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,740
we'll get improved.
I don't know.

608
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:27,550
There's a lot of the problem with,
with elegant is actually an interesting

609
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:29,500
a question.
Maybe just say what,

610
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,100
what is,
what does elegance and what does it,

611
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:32,500
what is beauty?
I guess so one,

612
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,950
the one thing,
one thing that's come up even within

613
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:34,311
this,
this,

614
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:35,460
the string theory,
um,

615
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,310
issue is this question are,
you know,

616
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:39,680
is this a beautiful idea or a beautiful
theory?

617
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,960
So,
so my colleague Brian Greene as,

618
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:42,930
um,
irritant,

619
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,340
very,
very good book about this called the

620
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:46,110
elegant universe.
And so he's,

621
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,210
um,
and so,

622
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:48,600
and,
and,

623
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,470
and within,
within,

624
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,820
within physics,
this is our,

625
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,700
I mean we're,
we're,

626
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,630
we're often raise struck by some of
these basic ideas are,

627
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:02,130
um,
what we would like to our race striking

628
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:04,660
and that we like to,
in a way which we like to describe as

629
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,030
being elegant are beautiful.

630
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,223
But,
um,

631
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,210
the problem with w with those,
that terminology,

632
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,210
especially with the terminology of
beauty is that beauty means a lot of

633
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:15,000
different things to a lot of different
people and a lot of different ways in

634
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:19,410
which things can be beautiful.
But this really has very specific

635
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:22,260
meaning and,
and which is more along the lines of

636
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:25,410
elegance,
which is that we say that an idea as

637
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:28,110
beautiful or elegant in mathematics or
physics,

638
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:29,790
if,
you know,

639
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:34,590
a very simple principle and raised
simple idea or a simple set of ideas,

640
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,260
it turns out to be very powerful and,
and you know,

641
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,500
leads to all sorts of unexpected
structure and unexpected predictions.

642
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,783
And,
um,

643
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,550
I think maybe the,
what I find is,

644
00:27:45,551 --> 00:27:45,900
is,
is,

645
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,140
is the most beautiful,
most elegant thing about this whole

646
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:51,450
subject is a little bit what I was
trying to explain earlier.

647
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:52,650
If for instance,
this idea,

648
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,630
maybe just to say this idea that the,
um,

649
00:27:55,370 --> 00:28:00,000
the fact that the laws of physics are
the same as you as you move in time

650
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,320
means that has very unexpected and
significance.

651
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,150
It means that there,
there is this thing called energy and

652
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,210
um,
you can associate a number of cold

653
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:12,660
energy to us to institute a physical
systems and it's not going to change it

654
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:13,494
as,
as you,

655
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,390
as time evolves.
So the,

656
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:16,870
um,
I mean that,

657
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,260
that's actually the,
so,

658
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:19,880
so in,
in,

659
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,450
in,
in classical physics,

660
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:22,580
that's actually,
they're there,

661
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,600
that's a theorem called an annoyed.
There's,

662
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:25,434
they're,
um,

663
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,363
after,
uh,

664
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,920
method one called [inaudible] there.
Uh,

665
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:29,991
so,
so,

666
00:28:29,991 --> 00:28:32,100
so there,
it's a little bit of a slight non

667
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:33,710
trivial theater,
Amanda,

668
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,000
and that,
that's certainly a,

669
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,130
a beautiful theorem.
What,

670
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,110
what fascinates me more is that in
quantum mechanics,

671
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,290
northern scenario isn't even a theorem.
It's just kind of,

672
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,410
it's just implicit in the definition.
Just the,

673
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:48,120
um,
the way you set things up,

674
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:50,780
it just is automatically true.
So it's a,

675
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,470
anyway,
they're there,

676
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,120
there's a theorem and,
and approve in classical physics and

677
00:28:57,121 --> 00:28:58,340
then you,
you,

678
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:58,680
you,
you,

679
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,880
you,
you start thinking about quantum

680
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:03,840
mechanics and you think about it and
then it's just kind of automatically

681
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:05,370
true.
There's not even a theorem anymore.

682
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:06,870
And it's like,
that's just beautiful.

683
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,420
Well,
I think,

684
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,470
I mean,
any kind of thing that human beings do

685
00:29:14,471 --> 00:29:18,820
and there's certain politics to it and
certain economic politics and Polish

686
00:29:18,821 --> 00:29:19,654
with field.
So,

687
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,583
but,
um,

688
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,720
mathematics is actually a relatively
healthy field these days.

689
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,680
I mean,
people are,

690
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,053
you know,
are,

691
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,541
are,
are,

692
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:29,430
are,
are making,

693
00:29:29,431 --> 00:29:31,010
making good progress and a lot of
different work,

694
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,450
different ways.
And it's also so,

695
00:29:34,451 --> 00:29:35,250
so anyway,
I,

696
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,450
I've,
I've kind of lived part of my

697
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:39,420
professional life and mathematics and
part of the physics.

698
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,523
And,
um,

699
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,540
and one thing to say about that,
that mathematics is,

700
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:46,300
it's a,
I think a kid can have its problems,

701
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:46,571
but,
but,

702
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:46,981
but,
but it's,

703
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:51,981
it's actually hasn't seen
it.

704
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,550
It hasn't seen a lot of the problems of
other sciences and politically,

705
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:56,170
partly,
partly also the

706
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,490
wonderful thing about mathematics is
since so much of it is what people are

707
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:01,810
doing is completely useless.

708
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,670
Nobody,
I'm nobody kind of in the outside world

709
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,430
we're like cares very much.
You don't really have,

710
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,330
you don't have kind of a right and left
and people getting in,

711
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:12,130
you know,
kind of ideology coming in because there

712
00:30:12,131 --> 00:30:14,920
isn't any,
it just doesn't actually connect up to

713
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:18,700
the kinds of things that people who were
worried about ideologically worry about.

714
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:21,160
So most of mathematics,
which it doesn't,

715
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:24,730
it doesn't tell you anything one way or
another about global warming or about,

716
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,310
you know,
health care or about any other number of

717
00:30:27,311 --> 00:30:29,410
things you might care about.
So,

718
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:33,690
so it's a mathematics.
It is immune to a lot of exterior pot,

719
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,470
real world politics because of that and
the academic politics or it's there.

720
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:39,304
But,
um,

721
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,770
I,
I think it's actually less than a lot of

722
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:42,430
fields.
I,

723
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,520
one of my colleagues likes to say that
mathematics is the,

724
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:50,980
he thinks that about the only subject
that he knows of it in academia or in

725
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:53,830
the real world where if two people
disagree about something,

726
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,410
if it,
if people are studying some mathematical

727
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:57,580
object,
then there's what you're supposed to be

728
00:30:57,581 --> 00:31:00,970
a proof and they disagree about whether
this proof works or not.

729
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,620
They will,
you know,

730
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,730
go into a room,
sit down and talk about it and fairly

731
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,010
quickly or at the end of the day one of
them will admit they're wrong.

732
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,540
And then he says,
you know,

733
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:11,820
that the problem a lot of companies,
this is,

734
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,750
this is just doesn't happen.
Whereas mathematics,

735
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:16,090
this is just happens all the time.
And so the people,

736
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:19,540
um,
there is this notion of logic and proof

737
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:22,600
and rigor,
which we can all allows us to kind of

738
00:31:22,601 --> 00:31:25,780
all stay on one track.
Physics is,

739
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:26,950
um,
well the other thing I'd say that

740
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:27,521
physics,
first of all,

741
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:30,280
physics is a very complicated subject
with many,

742
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:32,590
many different things.
A string theory and particle physics or

743
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:36,160
only a small part of a physics.
So when I talk about physics and I

744
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:38,320
talked about them and the problems of
those subjects,

745
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,260
it's really a problem is of a very
small,

746
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,850
you know in one discipline,
in one subfield of physics and a lot of

747
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:48,010
physicists,
people are kind of happily going on and

748
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,190
doing their science and quite
successfully and it has nothing to do

749
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:54,130
with it and they get very,
very annoyed when I hear people going on

750
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:57,550
about the problems of string theory and
as if that's some big problem for

751
00:31:57,551 --> 00:31:59,380
physics because it's not their problem.

752
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,040
String theory in particle physics
suffers.

753
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:06,430
I think a lot from the,
from this business of being from its own

754
00:32:06,431 --> 00:32:08,080
success,
from not having any,

755
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:12,340
I'm not nobody kind of,
it kind of has it.

756
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:16,000
Has it been able to come up with any
really good ideas to make positive

757
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:21,001
progress just because there's been no
experimental evidence to give you a clue

758
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:24,460
as to which direction to go and that the
subject is,

759
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:27,770
I think traditionally been very
connected often in,

760
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,000
in at least from mathematicians point of
view and very faddish way that

761
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:33,520
everybody,
all the smart people in the subject.

762
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:35,260
The idea was it was,
it would all kind of jump at the same

763
00:32:35,261 --> 00:32:40,040
problem and I'll try and work in the
same problem very often because the,

764
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,710
the subject was driven by experiment and
you know,

765
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,100
somebody would go out and turn on a new
accelerator like the LSD at higher

766
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:49,280
energy and this is certainly going to
happen next year if the LHC is see

767
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:52,010
something unexpected,
everyone in the whole field is going to

768
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,230
be trying to explain that one thing.

769
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,970
And so you have a very kind of,
a little bit of kind of faddish

770
00:32:58,971 --> 00:33:02,120
sociology that everybody is trying to
do,

771
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:05,360
do the same thing at the same time.
Or as in other fields like mathematics,

772
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:08,930
people kind of spread out and develop
expert their expertise and work on

773
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:13,931
different things.
So part of the problem of the politics

774
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:19,091
of particle theory and has been that you
have people used to the idea that well

775
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:20,601
you should,
you know,

776
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:23,390
look around and see what these smart
people are working on and I should work

777
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:25,700
in the same thing as them.
And so you've got,

778
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,520
you have all these people kind of trying
to do this.

779
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:33,500
And so string theory then got identified
back in 84 as being the hot topic.

780
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,720
And for a lot of reasons,
partly,

781
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:36,670
um,
you know,

782
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,270
probably cause it was an intriguing
idea,

783
00:33:38,271 --> 00:33:39,790
but,
but partly also because one of the,

784
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,260
uh,
there's one of the great geniuses of our

785
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:44,520
subject that Edward Whitton,
who's a

786
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,350
fantastic genius,
has done these amazing things and you

787
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:50,420
know,
he got very interested in it and he

788
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:54,410
started promoting the idea that this is
a very promising idea.

789
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,920
And so everyone kind of jumped,
jumped on it.

790
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:58,843
And,
uh,

791
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:00,480
and,
and,

792
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,780
and my,
my initial reaction at that time,

793
00:34:02,781 --> 00:34:04,160
that was,
I was just getting out of graduate

794
00:34:04,161 --> 00:34:06,520
school at that time.
And you know,

795
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,190
my,
my,

796
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,690
partly the way I work and the way I
think I,

797
00:34:09,691 --> 00:34:11,600
I wasn't so interested.
The idea of trying to do it at the same

798
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:14,540
thing as everybody else,
I would prefer to work on something a

799
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:16,610
bit different.
And partly also,

800
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,150
it didn't seem to me that,
you know,

801
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,870
it wasn't that this was obviously a good
idea.

802
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:22,550
It might be a good idea.
I might not,

803
00:34:22,551 --> 00:34:23,900
but,
but there were obvious problems with it

804
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:27,810
from the beginning.
And so anyways,

805
00:34:27,811 --> 00:34:31,340
so starting in [inaudible] 84,
everybody started working on this and I

806
00:34:31,341 --> 00:34:32,930
think my reaction to it was,
well,

807
00:34:32,931 --> 00:34:35,540
you know,
that's great that they're doing this and

808
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,380
what's going to happen is what normally
happens in the subject is that after six

809
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:42,860
months or a year or two years,
people will see whether it's a good idea

810
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,880
or not and you know,
you,

811
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,260
and if it's not a good idea,
they'll,

812
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:46,970
they'll move on.

813
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:51,650
And the really peculiar thing that
happened here was that,

814
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,180
you know,
25 years later,

815
00:34:53,181 --> 00:34:55,090
this is still,
um,

816
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,900
there's still a lot of people doing
this.

817
00:34:56,901 --> 00:34:57,171
I mean,
it,

818
00:34:57,171 --> 00:34:57,441
it,
it,

819
00:34:57,441 --> 00:35:01,270
it really kind of caught fire and even
without succeeding it,

820
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,010
it's still kind of developed into this
hole,

821
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,260
into this huge subject.
And,

822
00:35:06,261 --> 00:35:08,270
um,
it kind of in some sense kind of

823
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:11,270
achieves some kind of critical mass and
more and more people were working on it

824
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:15,050
and they're working on it for so long
that people ended up kind of devoting

825
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:17,060
their careers to it.
And it's a very,

826
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:18,950
very difficult and a very complicated
subject.

827
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,060
And,
uh,

828
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:24,050
it,
it requires quite a lot of time just to

829
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:26,060
even get to the point of understanding
what's going on.

830
00:35:26,061 --> 00:35:30,440
So you had lots of want more and more
people working on this for investing

831
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:34,130
more and more of their time and their
careers and their lives and it,

832
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:36,740
and,
and I think it really got to the

833
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:40,650
unfortunate that people were kind of
unwilling to kind of admit that this

834
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:44,880
wasn't working.
And it's a natural human reaction to an

835
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:46,860
idea of your fond of that you put a lot
into it to,

836
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,250
it's kind of hard to get to,
to get you to admit often wellmade this

837
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:51,570
doesn't work.
And,

838
00:35:51,571 --> 00:35:53,700
and,
and this was kind of happening very much

839
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,940
in spades in this story I think has been
very hard to get people to kind of admit

840
00:35:56,941 --> 00:35:58,890
that this is something that hasn't
worked out.

841
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,630
There's actually kind of two that,
to kind of two things.

842
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,620
What does the blog else I wrote wrote
this book.

843
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:11,910
And so the,
um,

844
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,460
anyway,
for,

845
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:13,820
for,
for,

846
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:17,310
for many years I was,
I wasn't very happy with what was going

847
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:18,930
on there and I was kind of observing,
Kay,

848
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,970
this is becoming more and more
problematic.

849
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:23,530
There's this,
you know,

850
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,430
not only are our people kind of not
admitting that this isn't working out,

851
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:27,330
but you know,
there's this,

852
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:29,430
there's this whole that,
you know,

853
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,950
there's a lot of kind of public
promotion of the subject and,

854
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:33,540
uh,
and it's very difficult,

855
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,460
complicated ethnography.
A lot of people don't or don't

856
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:37,500
understand it.
And so it's,

857
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,620
this is really not a healthy situation
so that someone should kind of,

858
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,550
you know,
and kind of clearly explained to larger

859
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:45,730
community of physicists and,
and,

860
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,050
and also at the non physicists,
it,

861
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,660
you know exactly what the situation is
here.

862
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,493
And,
uh,

863
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,020
and so I,
I wrote an article about this and then I

864
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:54,390
finally wrote this book and it took,
it took,

865
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,160
it took a while to get the book
publishers.

866
00:36:56,161 --> 00:36:58,200
That's a long and interesting story.
But,

867
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,680
but then while after,
I guess it's after,

868
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:04,130
after the book was written,
I also started a,

869
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,150
started to see,
there were a couple of other physicists

870
00:37:06,151 --> 00:37:07,590
would started blogs.
And I thought,

871
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:10,140
well this is an interesting,
interesting thing to try to do.

872
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:14,400
And I can both talk about his issues
related to string theory and things,

873
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:18,070
which I was trying to get out through
the book but also kind of follow it and

874
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,900
on a day to day basis and also just kind
of write about whatever I'm interested

875
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:22,920
in.
So the um,

876
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,591
the blog,
I,

877
00:37:24,591 --> 00:37:28,040
I guess I don't worry a lot about who
about the,

878
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,220
about the audience for it.

879
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,100
It's kind of written things.
I realize it's very much,

880
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,090
it's really just kind of whatever,
whatever I would like to read.

881
00:37:36,091 --> 00:37:37,800
So I'm going to run,
I'm kind of writing whenever I would

882
00:37:37,801 --> 00:37:40,350
like to read stuff to it.
So if there's somebody out there exactly

883
00:37:40,351 --> 00:37:42,330
like me,
they much find is really fascinating and

884
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,270
if there's something quite different,
they find it not at all interesting.

885
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,190
And so,
but because of that it's um,

886
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,040
the kinds of things in the blog are
often,

887
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:50,640
you know,
if I,

888
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,160
if I learned something or something new,
interesting going on and even in pure

889
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:56,340
mathematics I'll be writing about that
or pretty much anything going on in

890
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:58,770
between mathematics and physics.
They're writing about that,

891
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:04,100
writing a lot about the LHC and um,
and also just about whatever is going on

892
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:07,230
in this controversy over string theory
and had done,

893
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:11,820
it's kind of,
it's interesting that more kind of keeps

894
00:38:11,821 --> 00:38:14,340
happening without this,
my book came out and there was at the

895
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:16,290
same time there's a book by another
physicist,

896
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,510
um,
with a similar point of view to mind and

897
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:21,440
all came to that came out with that,
that causes a lot of controversies with

898
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,020
a lot of reviews and a lot of argument
going on in these blogs.

899
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,840
And a lot of people refer to this as the
string wars.

900
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:29,460
And so the,
there's this very,

901
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:35,140
for for a year or two there,
there was a kind of a right,

902
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:36,220
interesting.
If you're interested,

903
00:38:36,221 --> 00:38:38,230
it's kind of thing.
There's an interesting warfare in terms

904
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:41,590
of blog postings.
And comments going on on my site and

905
00:38:41,591 --> 00:38:44,200
grey as others.
And that was all sort of with,

906
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,820
that would lead to all sorts of strange
things.

907
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,790
Seven.
And I mean I,

908
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,380
it depends.
I often learn interesting things from

909
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,521
comment,
you know,

910
00:38:55,521 --> 00:38:57,320
so,
so now that the blog is fairly well

911
00:38:57,321 --> 00:38:59,880
known,
so people will write in comments and

912
00:38:59,881 --> 00:39:02,660
I've logged off and telling me about
something I hadn't heard about her new

913
00:39:02,661 --> 00:39:04,910
button you don't know about and that
that's very interesting order.

914
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,770
They'll,
they'll often send it to me privately by

915
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,600
email saying,
hey,

916
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:11,040
you might be interested in this.
And so I get a lot of that.

917
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,760
I learned a lot that way.
Um,

918
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,700
or what interesting thing I thought I'm
using about the whole string theory

919
00:39:16,701 --> 00:39:18,980
thing discussion was that it say,
uh,

920
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:24,560
it really is,
it's an incredibly complex and difficult

921
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:29,120
subject.
And so it's really hard to over

922
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:33,470
emphasize how it's a subject that really
nobody understands very well.

923
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:36,070
And even the people who are the most
experts at it are.

924
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:40,580
And it's amazing experience of having a
conversation with some Nobel prize

925
00:39:40,581 --> 00:39:42,440
winners who people are thought of as
the,

926
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,140
the brightest people in this field and
asking them what they think of the

927
00:39:45,141 --> 00:39:46,980
string theory and they'll say,
no,

928
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,650
I don't know.
I don't really understand what's going

929
00:39:48,651 --> 00:39:49,880
on.
I don't want to comment on it.

930
00:39:49,881 --> 00:39:52,100
And it's just,
I'm baffled by it.

931
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,330
So one interesting thing about the,
some of these discussions and the blog

932
00:39:56,331 --> 00:40:01,331
was I found one way to have to figure
out exactly what's going on in,

933
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,850
in string theory and whether,
you know,

934
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,720
if something is really a problem or or
not is to just put up my understanding

935
00:40:08,721 --> 00:40:09,830
of it,
you know,

936
00:40:09,831 --> 00:40:11,690
in a blog posting or in a comment or
whatever.

937
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,720
And then fairly quickly you would find
that either,

938
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,060
you know,
either I was wrong and there,

939
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:19,490
there was some reason that this actually
made sense even though I thought it

940
00:40:19,491 --> 00:40:20,810
didn't and this would,
I would,

941
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,310
I would quickly,
often abusive Leebee explained to me

942
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:25,790
what an idiot I was and why this was,
you know,

943
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,020
here's the,
here's the answer,

944
00:40:27,021 --> 00:40:31,370
what you really should have known or,
and then then I found out that,

945
00:40:31,371 --> 00:40:32,360
okay,
I learned something.

946
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:32,920
Or,
or,

947
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,770
or often I would found out that if I was
writing,

948
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,970
if there really was a problem here,
the answer I would get would often be

949
00:40:37,971 --> 00:40:39,320
just this abuse of,
Oh,

950
00:40:39,321 --> 00:40:41,210
you know,
you're a complete jerk and you're a

951
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:42,050
moron and,
but,

952
00:40:42,051 --> 00:40:43,950
but no,
no,

953
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,740
no scientific answer to,
to the,

954
00:40:45,741 --> 00:40:47,120
to the scientific question.
So,

955
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,650
uh,
that was one that was actually an

956
00:40:48,651 --> 00:40:51,740
interesting way to kind of see exactly
what the state of research and the

957
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:56,741
subject was by kind of probing it and
trying to an egg and getting that kind

958
00:40:57,051 --> 00:41:00,770
of response from some of the more
hostile people in the subject.

959
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,213
Okay.

960
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:09,780
I mean,
I,

961
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,580
it's mostly a positive thing.
I mean,

962
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:13,890
one thing to say about the w,
one of the main problems with,

963
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:15,440
with the blogs,
one of the most annoying thing about the

964
00:41:15,441 --> 00:41:17,030
logs is,
especially if,

965
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:17,560
if,
if a,

966
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,090
if a lot of people are reading it,
you're really in a situation where

967
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,610
there's a small number of people who
really understand this and know what's

968
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:26,130
going on and have something really
sensible to say about it.

969
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,510
There's a very large number of people
who have some kind of interest in it and

970
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,970
you know,
have the time and energy to sit there

971
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,920
and write uninformed things on your blog
and,

972
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,840
and kind of just so,
so I actually did,

973
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:42,650
I think I'd like some logs actually
delete a lot of the comments submitted

974
00:41:42,651 --> 00:41:45,500
to my blog and try to keep the noise
level down.

975
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:46,390
And,
um,

976
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,121
so,
so,

977
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:49,010
so that's the most,
probably the most discouraging thing

978
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:52,970
about the whole experience is just as
the number of people out there who kind

979
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:55,070
of want to go on about this and argue
about this but don't know what they're

980
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:59,990
talking about and want to kind of fill
the internet and all information sources

981
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:03,050
they get their hands on with kind of
uninformed nonsense.

982
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,850
So there's a lot of that,
but the,

983
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,270
um,
but,

984
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,140
but,
but just the kind of discussion of the

985
00:42:09,141 --> 00:42:12,320
other subject and have its problems,
which I think went on in these blogs and

986
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,490
which are in which,
you know,

987
00:42:13,491 --> 00:42:16,520
if you're interested,
you can now have an going to go and see

988
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:18,290
and read.
I don't think there's really any other

989
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:19,070
form of,
you know,

990
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,250
it's an amazing format for that.
There's really no other way that,

991
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,960
you know,
that discussion could,

992
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:26,270
it could be held in that way.
And um,

993
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:27,450
and,
and,

994
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:27,831
and,
and,

995
00:42:27,831 --> 00:42:29,240
and also,
I mean the Internet just provides us

996
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:33,710
amazing access to the information of a
sort,

997
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:36,050
which is just totally unlike anything
we've had before.

998
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:41,000
You can just google some term and
immediately have access to all sorts of

999
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:44,090
uh,
often high level discussions of the

1000
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,060
subject.
And um,

1001
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,820
I think the one,
well it's actually made some of the um,

1002
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:57,710
faddishness of particle theory actually
a bit worse in the sense that one thing

1003
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:01,070
that used to kind of slow down and fads
was just the,

1004
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,320
how long it took to communicate them to
people.

1005
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:03,861
I mean,
you know,

1006
00:43:03,861 --> 00:43:07,760
the certain prominent people might have
started working on some idea at

1007
00:43:07,761 --> 00:43:11,300
Princeton or Harvard,
but it would take a while for that news

1008
00:43:11,301 --> 00:43:14,510
of that and understanding of what these
people were doing to filter out to the

1009
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:17,420
rest of the community.
And if people want it to kind of jump on

1010
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:19,940
it and pursue it in a faddish way,
it would take them while to even find

1011
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:23,140
out about it.
Whereas now everybody's kind of,

1012
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:26,990
every night there's a new set of
preprints coming out in the pre print

1013
00:43:26,991 --> 00:43:29,220
server and people logging in and looking
at these.

1014
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,480
And the minute that somebody has some
new thing,

1015
00:43:32,481 --> 00:43:34,760
which is becoming a kind of faddish
thing to work on,

1016
00:43:34,761 --> 00:43:39,200
everybody throughout the world has it at
exactly the same time when their desktop

1017
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:41,180
and can start thinking about it and
working on it.

1018
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:44,390
And so it kind of makes that even more
so than it used to be.

1019
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:50,580
[inaudible].
