1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,360
Health care is hugely inefficient
industry Mckinsey analyze the American

2
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:20,681
healthcare system versus healthcare
systems in the other country and it came

3
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:26,600
up with a figure that there is about a
half a trillion dollars of.

4
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,980
I would put it waste in the US
healthcare system.

5
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,700
The biggest source of waste is the way
we treat people with chronic diseases.

6
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,070
Diseases like diabetes,
AIDS,

7
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:41,960
heart disease,
cancer,

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,550
people who have chronic disabilities
like bad backs,

9
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,180
and we treat them in a very fragmented
way.

10
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,870
We have no one organization that is
responsible for everything that the

11
00:00:56,511 --> 00:01:01,370
person with diabetes has.
Everything that the person with AIDS

12
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:02,550
needs,
needs.

13
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,430
People have tremendously complicated
needs there in diseases core

14
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,750
multifactorial,
and they manifest themselves in many

15
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:15,200
different ways.
What we need as a healthcare system

16
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:20,201
that's organized around the needs of the
patient for total care for their

17
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:23,930
diseases,
total care for their disability.

18
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,310
What we have as a healthcare system
that's organized by inputs,

19
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,900
doctors,
hospitals,

20
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:33,350
nursing homes,
each one of these inputs,

21
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,350
each one of these providers,
what did they want?

22
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,090
Well,
they hilman.

23
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,120
What they want is they want to make sure
that they met summize,

24
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:47,121
their share of their pie.
Maximizing their share of the pie is not

25
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:50,150
the same as doing what's best for that
patient.
