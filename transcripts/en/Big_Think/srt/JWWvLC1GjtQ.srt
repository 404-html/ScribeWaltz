1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,240
Sustainability is a really broad scope
of,

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,980
of dealing with,
with conflict or with issues or

3
00:00:08,981 --> 00:00:11,550
challenges that come across,
um,

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,590
in the more developed countries,
you know,

5
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:19,591
we'll look at how we avoid abusing the
environment and how we can build a

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,220
buildings in a green sustainable
standards and we're very advanced on

7
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,060
that,
on that side.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,170
But if you go to Africa to countries,
um,

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,880
you know,
like Uganda and Nigeria and Ghana and if

10
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:39,400
you go to Central America,
you know,

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,880
the basic needs of sustainability
sometimes is to teach the basic hygiene

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,200
for,
for children,

13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,300
giving them a toothbrush and,
and,

14
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:56,301
and explaining them how to cross the
roads for safety,

15
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,200
which is something that they're not
familiar because they live in distant

16
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:05,201
and rural Arrow and working with the
community around what is important for

17
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:11,771
them as part of their sustainability,
how they build their capabilities over

18
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:12,740
time.

19
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,270
Whether again this is more of a health
care issues,

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,600
education around topics and we embrace
the environmental issues into these,

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,040
these ideas,
but in a very soft way.

22
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,960
So there is a big difference for
sustainability in the developed or in

23
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:33,650
the third world countries.
And in the developed world,

24
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,180
we're doing these big water project in
the Bahamas.

25
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:43,181
It's a $90,000,000 project on reducing
water leakage in the system.

26
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:51,010
Over 10 year period,
we will reduce the water leakage from 50

27
00:01:51,171 --> 00:01:55,970
percent to 25 percent.
And we've been doing a lot of work

28
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,870
around education of people working with
schools,

29
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:03,170
working with children about the
importance of water,

30
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,260
about the importance of saving water,
about creating the awareness of why

31
00:02:09,111 --> 00:02:14,111
water or are so crucial in our life.
Why clean water are so crucial in our

32
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:19,610
life.
This is sustainability for these

33
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:23,390
specific citizens in this specific area
of the world.

34
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,020
So you can combine the message according
to what you do and according to what the

35
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:34,250
people on the ground needs and these
things being been very successful.

36
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,100
You can save a lot of money,
not only water,

37
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,970
but a lot of money for these schools and
for these families.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,110
If you make and create the awareness and
education programs around that.
