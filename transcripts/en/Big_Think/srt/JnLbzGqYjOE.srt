1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,280
I
would say the biggest challenge

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,850
todd as a woman in science is being a
mom.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,710
It's really hard.
It's very hard work having children.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,990
Um,
and I tell kids this all the time and

5
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:21,550
they say,
what's the hardest thing you've ever

6
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:23,620
done?
Because I've done so many space missions

7
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:26,860
and Hubble and pro your big project.
I like all the hardest thing is being a

8
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,960
mom.
Kids like 24,

9
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:30,310
seven,
you can't stop it.

10
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:32,740
It's always there.
And uh,

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,380
as a scientist it's hard because you
know,

12
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:39,700
my particular field of science and most
fields of science require quite a bit of

13
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:44,590
dedication to whether it's laboratory
work or in my case telescopic work.

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,020
I'm where I need to go places and do
things.

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,330
Uh,
having high quality daycare is by far

16
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:54,790
the most important thing you can do when
your kids are little.

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,820
You know,
I,

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,120
I,
when I relocated,

19
00:00:58,121 --> 00:01:00,910
I spent more time looking for daycare,
then I did looking for a house,

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,530
it was much more important to have good
daycare and I was fortunate to find high

21
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:07,900
quality daycare where I just totally
trusted it.

22
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,640
Then my kids were great.
They the absolutely fantastic kids doing

23
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:15,580
super jobs now and you know,
they're wonderful.

24
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:17,740
But you know,
I had to spend a lot of time and energy

25
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:22,741
doing that.
I also learned you must rely on friends

26
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:26,380
and family to help you out.
You can't do it on your own.

27
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,340
You know,
there's this people like y'all,

28
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:29,350
you know,
how do you do it?

29
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:31,180
I'm like,
well my neighbors,

30
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,310
my mom helps,
you know,

31
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,150
I just rely on other people.
That's the way it has to be.

32
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,820
Otherwise you just go nuts.
Uh,

33
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,120
so it's,
it's a tough balancing act and I also

34
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:46,480
learned that there is no such thing as
balance that,

35
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,300
you know,
on any individual day your life is

36
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:54,250
completely skewed one way or the other.
One day you're like dealing with child

37
00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:57,850
crises and you're just coping.
And the next day,

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,980
you know,
you may be dealing with a work crisis

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,010
and just dealing with that over the long
run,

40
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:05,080
you have to find sort of the right
balance,

41
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,950
but you can't expect it to balance.
It ended the individual moment cause it

42
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:11,430
won't.
And once you learn to give that up lunch

43
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,300
and learn to give up the myth of
balance,

44
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,860
you know,
you can be a much more relaxed.

45
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,920
Personally,
I would encourage anybody who's

46
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,800
interested in any kind of,
and

47
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,090
if science engineering,
math field to go after that.

48
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,490
You know,
I am not about telling people,

49
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,760
become astronomers.
We don't need a lot of astronomers,

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,740
but what I want to avoid is that young
young woman coming along who was

51
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,510
absolutely fascinated in biochemistry,
but she's told,

52
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,700
oh no,
biochemistry.

53
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,020
That's the guy's field.
That's wrong.

54
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,300
You know,
and I,

55
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,460
I,
the best compliment I ever had was a

56
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:54,580
young person who I just met standing in
line to go to a concert.

57
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:57,910
It was like two years after the
shoemaker levy nine thing where I had

58
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,710
been in the news a lot and this guy and
all,

59
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:02,950
we were talking,
waiting to get into the concert and he

60
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,010
said,
you don't have love.

61
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,590
I am.
I introduced myself,

62
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,200
Heidi,
it's like you,

63
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,350
Heidi,
Heidi humble,

64
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:09,730
the astronomer.
I'm like,

65
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,571
yeah,
that's me.

66
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:11,404
He's like,
ah,

67
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,990
you're the reason I became a biologist.

68
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,930
I said,
Oh yeah.

69
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,550
How'd that happen?
He said,

70
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:20,350
well,
when you did that comment,

71
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,770
crash thing,
I just thought that was so cool and I

72
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:26,500
had really slacked off.
I dropped out of college and I was just,

73
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:27,520
you know,
being a slacker.

74
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,080
But I was so excited by that,
that I went back to college and I took

75
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,290
astronomy courses and I said,
well,

76
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,500
that's pretty cool.
And he said,

77
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:36,790
yeah,
but I hated astronomy.

78
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,290
I'm like,
well,

79
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,550
it's not for everyone.
He said,

80
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,790
I love biology.
And then went on to get my phd in

81
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,770
biology and like,
that's it.

82
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,480
That's what it's all about.
You know?

83
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,460
That's my message is don't be
discouraged by anything anybody tells

84
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:52,300
you.
You know?

85
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:54,190
In my case,
that's the science thing.

86
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:55,900
And I just ignored people who said,
oh,

87
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,370
girls don't do that and what blah,
blah,

88
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,140
blah.
I just went ahead and did it anyway.

89
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:00,730
You know?
Lack of fear,

90
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,800
stupidity.
I don't know why I just kept doing it,

91
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,150
but to tell young people,
don't listen to those folks that you

92
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:07,984
can't.

93
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,940
If you want to do it.
That's the message.
