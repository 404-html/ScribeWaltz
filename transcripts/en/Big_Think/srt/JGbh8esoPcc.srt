1
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,510
George clooney is like the gold standard
or for class and dignity and he gets it.

2
00:00:13,331 --> 00:00:17,380
He once said,
my famous is my currency,

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,440
and he uses that for causes that are
important to him.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,790
I think Brad and Angelina are pretty
remarkable in the way they've managed

5
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,190
their family,
their public image.

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,000
To me,
Madonna is just amazing in her ability

7
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:35,680
to remain relevant for a very long time.
You know,

8
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,790
I look at celebrities having been in
Hollywood more than 20 years and

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,060
following it,
a lot of people are famous for their

10
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:46,630
moment,
but people who are still relevant 20

11
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:48,280
years later,
to me that's.

12
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,080
That's pretty darn impressive.

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,850
I think a lot of these corporate ceos
live in a different world.

14
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:02,540
They live in a world of multimillion
dollar bonuses.

15
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:07,541
They live in a world of private jets and
that's the mill you they live in and I

16
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:10,760
think the auto companies got it.
They,

17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,950
they had a misstep.
They got it.

18
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,760
They drove back to Washington the second
time and look what happened.

19
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:20,600
They got a deal out of it.
So I think there's a lot of.

20
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,880
They require people and people liked me.
Just because somebody is a CEO of a

21
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:28,550
company,
I need to tell them the truth.

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,490
I need to say,
you're not playing this right or this

23
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:36,140
isn't going to work right now for these
reasons and whether they choose to

24
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:39,620
listen or not.
I look at it as a responsibility of mine

25
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,150
to deal in reality because if I don't
tell them and they go out,

26
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:46,010
they're going to say,
why didn't you tell me?

27
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,440
If I do tell them and they still choose
to do it,

28
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,730
maybe they listen next time.
There are people who don't care about

29
00:01:52,731 --> 00:01:55,250
the rules.
I use the.

30
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,330
I used the example of former vice
president,

31
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:01,550
Dick Cheney.
He.

32
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,720
He knows people don't really like him
out there.

33
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:08,710
His poll numbers are down,
but he figures,

34
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,280
screw you.
I'm the.

35
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:12,080
I was the vice president of United
States.

36
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:16,520
I had all the power I wanted and I'm
beyond caring about what my public

37
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:19,460
images and he somebody who transcended
that.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,970
We look at somebody like Ann Coulter,
the political pundant,

39
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,670
and she likes to be intentionally
provocative.

40
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:30,020
She likes to say words that will upset
and shocked people.

41
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:34,160
The n word and the f word and get the
press and then doesn't care because she

42
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:38,360
believes that all press is good press,
which is not something I necessarily

43
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:39,830
believe.
In fact,

44
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:43,700
that's one of my core beliefs that no,
not all press is good press,

45
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,210
but most people who are in the public
eye,

46
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,130
they have earned it.
Maybe Yoko Ono's tired of it after all

47
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,080
these years,
but again,

48
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:57,440
unless she does something pretty
significant or makes an appearance in

49
00:02:57,441 --> 00:03:01,040
what you're not going to see about her,
some people have to do a little

50
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,140
something to keep their interest going
in there.

51
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:03,380
Man.
