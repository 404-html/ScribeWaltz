1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,460
If you talk to a foreign policy expert,
military expert,

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,230
not somebody who spends their time
focusing on civil liberties but hardcore

3
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:14,064
foreign policy,

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,040
very often they'll tell you that the
first thing the next president has to do

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,970
is close the facility at Guantanamo Bay.
It has done an calculable damage to the

6
00:00:25,811 --> 00:00:29,350
strength and security of the United
States and our reputation all around the

7
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:34,351
world to have torture,
to have people kidnapped by our

8
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:37,480
government,
which is what's called extraordinary

9
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:41,620
rendition,
to have the president and the people who

10
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:43,210
worked for the president saying in
effect,

11
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:46,420
the law doesn't apply to them when the
United States acts this way,

12
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:50,800
we lose our moral force.
And that has always been one of our

13
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,690
great sources of strength around the
world.

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,970
So you know,
there,

15
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,030
there are ways to protect the United
States that don't require trashing the

16
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:05,650
constitution.
It's not so much the individual rights

17
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,130
of the people who are detained at
Guantanamo Bay though that's important.

18
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,030
It's also the whole system of
constitutional checks and balances,

19
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,200
which is the key way we keep our
democracy working.

20
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,461
Uh,
when,

21
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:20,590
when you have a president and a congress
and the president,

22
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:23,230
especially who,
who wants to use their power,

23
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,910
you know,
it's not a surprise that after September

24
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,380
11th power flowed to the executive,
that often happens after crisis.

25
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:35,590
It often happens too much.
There's often an overreaction.

26
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:38,200
And then we kind of correct it.
And that's happened throughout the

27
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:40,330
country's history.
And it's not a surprise that there would

28
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:44,290
be that kind of power surge after
September 11th,

29
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,840
and the abuses by Bush and Cheney,
or not even necessarily the worst in the

30
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:53,440
country's history,
but what's different and very alarming

31
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,790
and really almost unheard of,
is their argument,

32
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,760
which is that this is not power that
President Bush has because of some

33
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:06,160
emergency.
It's not temporary.

34
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:08,860
It's not just because of the emergency
of fighting terrorism.

35
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,710
It's inherent.
They argue in the presidency.

36
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,390
They argued that the presidency has the
power of what Dick Cheney called

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,760
monarchical prerogatives of the kings,
which is basically the president.

38
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,220
Any president has the power of King
George as if we didn't fight a

39
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:31,900
revolution precisely to overcome that.
And,

40
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,130
uh,
you know,

41
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,040
it's the,
there's nothing more dangerous that this

42
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:39,790
administration has done.
Then the theory of presidential power

43
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:40,624
that they've pushed,

44
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,920
which left unchecked would change the
nature of life.

45
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,150
[inaudible].
