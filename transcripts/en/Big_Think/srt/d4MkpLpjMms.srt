1
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,440
Very different,
very different,

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,720
um,
you know,

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,560
I mean,
when you shoot with models,

4
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:15,380
they're professionals and they're paid
to be there.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,410
Um,
and so they,

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,390
they typically are trained to take
direction and they're a natural

7
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:26,900
extroverts.
When you deal with celebrities,

8
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:31,901
you tend to deal a lot more with a,
with a tendency to be introverted says

9
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:34,000
at least in front of the,
uh,

10
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:37,190
the still camera.
And then typically celebrities are not

11
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:41,330
all that comfortable being photographed
because in reality they're out of

12
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:42,340
control,
uh,

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,670
that the level of their performance is a
very,

14
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,770
very different from that which they
express on a,

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,820
onto the motion picture experience.
So they,

16
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:58,130
you know,
they don't control when the shutter a is

17
00:00:58,131 --> 00:00:59,810
being depressed and what,
uh,

18
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:02,510
what image comes out of it.
So they tend to be a little,

19
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,920
I'm self conscious of that experience.
And the,

20
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:09,320
uh,
the role of a portrait photography is to

21
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:11,840
really be able to,
um,

22
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,860
to either exploit that vulnerability or
to,

23
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:18,680
um,
or to release it somehow and to get

24
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:19,850
something out of them.
It's,

25
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:20,601
um,
it's,

26
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,550
uh,
it can be a tricky experience and it's

27
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:23,630
always an adventure,
very,

28
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:25,370
very unique to

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,720
experience,
memorable,

30
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,890
all of the experiences,
you know,

31
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:38,140
I mean,
there are subjects that people,

32
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,530
uh,
who I've photographed multiple times and

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,110
have had a,
a great experience.

34
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:45,250
Shootings.
So,

35
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:48,880
and with that comes to mind.
Sandra bullock who have shot multiple

36
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:50,090
times and uh,
uh,

37
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,790
Kate Bosworth,
um,

38
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,990
and Orlando Bloom of course.
And um,

39
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,920
but then,
you know,

40
00:01:56,921 --> 00:02:00,310
I've had similar experiences where the
Philip Seymour Hoffman,

41
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:02,880
which sort of stands as a,
you know,

42
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,150
one of my favorite portrait.
It's very stoic and very,

43
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:07,990
uh,
so,

44
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,980
but portrait.
But,

45
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,030
uh,
but it somehow feels like with some

46
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:15,820
people you really get a photograph and
feel that,

47
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,440
you know,
perhaps with some,

48
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:19,810
like people might look at it a 20,
30,

49
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:20,730
50 years from now.
