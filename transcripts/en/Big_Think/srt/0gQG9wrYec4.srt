1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,730
It will be remembered as the age of 
revolution of the information technology

2
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:13,524
revolution,
which is only comparable to the 

3
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:18,540
industrial revolution,
which changed the nature of the globe,

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,000
not just America,
but worldwide,

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,660
instantaneous communication,
flow of information and knowledge,

6
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:25,494
and an incredible fashion.
And the impact that all of this 

7
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:30,714
information and flow of information and 
ideas is having on the world is not 

8
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,580
really for us to,
uh,

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,713
that I can accurately predict to you,
except you're going to have better 

10
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:42,990
informed world,
a better educated world,

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:43,883
a cleaner,
a better world as far as the spread of 

12
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:48,840
democracy and freedom is concerned.
And,

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,110
uh,
you're going to have a world that,

14
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:53,400
um,
is,

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,070
who's economy is basically global in 
nature.
