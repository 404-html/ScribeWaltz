1
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,820
A natural lifespan is probably between
$100,

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,070
120 years.
That seems to be about what

3
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,800
people can handle.
Um,

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,910
it's true that in the United States and
other established market economy,

5
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:27,830
countries,
wealthy countries,

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,450
we spend a tremendous amount of money at
the end of life.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,090
Now I'm one of these people that thinks
that everybody's life is of equal value.

8
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:41,990
The life of an 85 year old is just as
precious as a 12 year old and they are

9
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:46,991
entitled to as many efforts to save
their life as a younger person.

10
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:50,660
And I don't think one can say that,
well,

11
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,600
you know,
a 12 year old or a 20 year old because

12
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:56,660
they have so much more potential years
ahead of them.

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,230
Um,
is more valuable as a human being than

14
00:01:00,231 --> 00:01:03,440
someone who's 85.
I'm on the other hand,

15
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:08,400
I think we have to be cognizant that
when we spend money for healthcare,

16
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,840
it should be for healthcare.

17
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,760
Um,
sometimes we spend money just prolonging

18
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:16,100
the dying process.
And that's clearly,

19
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:17,990
I think,
the wrong thing to do,

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,650
not just from a financial point of view,
but from a human point of view,

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,720
if all we're doing is,
is increasing someone's suffering and

22
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:31,721
not really doing anything that can
meaningfully prolong their life in a way

23
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:35,120
that has value to them,
then I think we shouldn't do that.

24
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:40,700
But it sort of raises a larger issue.
Your question about how we can make the

25
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:44,870
population generally healthier,
as everyone knows,

26
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,690
it's been widely reported.
You know,

27
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,280
we spend more money on healthcare in
United States,

28
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:51,050
in any other country,
but we don't seem to be the healthiest

29
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:56,051
people on Earth.
We don't live longer than other people.

30
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:58,910
In fact,
we live less long than people in many

31
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,020
countries.
Um,

32
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:05,050
infant mortality in the United States is
higher than it is in many countries who

33
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:07,040
spend less money on healthcare than we
do.

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,030
So.
So I think we could be getting more out

35
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:16,031
of the money we spend on healthcare.
And in one of the ways to do that is to

36
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:20,240
think about public health approaches to
improving the health

37
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,710
of the population of.
I like to point out that frankly,

38
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:29,030
the person who's done more for the
health of New Yorkers in the last

39
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,830
several years than,
than anyone is the mayor.

40
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,200
Um,
and that's because he's really made it

41
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,320
so difficult to smoke cigarettes in New
York.

42
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,380
It's very expensive and you can't do it
in public m and a smoking rates have

43
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:46,110
dropped quite a bit in New York.
You know,

44
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,520
that's a good example of a public health
approach to a problem.

45
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,370
All sorts of things affect health,
not just medicine,

46
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,570
you know,
legal things,

47
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,310
economic things,
cultural things,

48
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:58,910
social things.
All these things address health impact.

49
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,860
And,
and,

50
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,860
uh,
I think if we realize that we get a lot

51
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:04,750
more out of the money we spend on
healthcare.
