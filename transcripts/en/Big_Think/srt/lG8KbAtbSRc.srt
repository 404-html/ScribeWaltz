1
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,340
Oh,
that's so interesting.

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,270
I'm,
you know,

3
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:14,190
I'm from New York.
I like New York,

4
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:16,560
but London is just cool.
It's really cool.

5
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:17,970
It's really,
really,

6
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:21,300
really international.
It's incredibly fun to walk around and

7
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:23,400
you get lost really easily,
cause it's impossible to,

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,620
you know,
there's no grid pattern.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,510
You can't find your way around.
And as an American,

10
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:30,090
it's like a complete candy store.
You know?

11
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:32,070
It's just so new and different and
interesting.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,870
But you know,
when you come back to New York,

13
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:36,510
people are so relaxed and I like the
relaxed.
