1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,190
We're
going to see the elephant is a story

2
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:12,690
about a young man who believes
themselves to be the greatest writer in

3
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:15,540
the history of the world.
The only problem is he hasn't written

4
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:16,470
anything yet.
It's a.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,320
it's a condition.
Many young writers find themselves in.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,160
He moves to San Francisco because he
thinks of this as a romantic literary

7
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:25,560
city and a place for him to fulfill his
destiny.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,720
And he gets a job,
sort of sweet.

9
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:30,750
Talks himself into a job at a place
called the morning trumpet,

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,570
which is a third rate newspaper,
whose,

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,320
you know,
heyday was probably an 1850 right after

12
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:39,690
the gold rush.
And it's been going downhill ever since.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,120
Even still,
they think slater brown,

14
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:45,210
the name of this young man is something
wrong about it.

15
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,150
He just doesn't quite add up.
And so to get rid of him,

16
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:49,880
they say,
if you're such a hot writer,

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,970
go find us a story.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,130
And they're pretty sure they'll never
see him again.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,680
Uh,
he proceeds to go out into the city of

20
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,350
San Francisco to look for a story.
Uh,

21
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:01,320
and a series of things happened to them.
And in very short order,

22
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:03,000
he's the most powerful person in the
city.

23
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,580
And um,
that's,

24
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,260
that's the nuts and bolts of it.
But,

25
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,640
uh,
when I sat down,

26
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,620
people asked me how I came to this idea
and I was walking around San Francisco

27
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:17,250
one day about seven years ago and I saw
this guy,

28
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:22,251
I saw my character in a coffee shop and
that was the impetus for me to start to

29
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:25,350
tell this story.
And the same character is in Dallas

30
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,270
today.
He's in New Orleans,

31
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:31,320
he's in New York City's in London.
It's the romantic,

32
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,620
idealized young man or woman who is a,
been a passionate reader and had,

33
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,260
wants to be a writer and now is on the
process of figuring out how to get

34
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:43,110
there.
And that's really what the book's theme

35
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:45,390
is about on some level.

36
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:55,330
I don't think I'm probably a good judge
of my themes yet.

37
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:59,510
I think there's still emerging and I
don't think when I sit down to write,

38
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:02,490
I'm usually drawn in by something that
I've heard a,

39
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,170
whether it's a piece of dialogue or
maybe I've seen something.

40
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,410
And that's sort of the starting point,
when I started to write this book,

41
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:12,050
going to see the elephant,
I didn't know where the end was,

42
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,810
which was a huge mistake.
Uh,

43
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,620
and I also didn't know if I could do it.
I mean,

44
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:16,970
it's sort of like training for a
marathon.

45
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,250
You believe you can do it,
uh,

46
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,330
you want to do it,
but can you do it?

47
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,480
And this book,
uh,

48
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,610
was a process of me figuring out how to
do that and writing it was a huge leap

49
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:29,660
of faith for me.
But also,

50
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,010
you know,
as I said earlier,

51
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:36,011
perhaps a benign mental illness,
I feel like I'm themes are things that

52
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:42,850
are found after the fact and that most
writers don't consciously engage in that

53
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,870
or if they do,
I think sometimes their work suffers

54
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:49,370
because of that.
Uh,

55
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,280
I,
I find my entry point into these things

56
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,370
to be more around characters or a
particular feeling or mood and not a,

57
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,280
you know,
I want to write a story about coming of

58
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,300
age or something like that.
