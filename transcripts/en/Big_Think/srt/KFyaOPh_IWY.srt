1
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,020
That neurological process includes a
sale as soon as,

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,570
okay,
make a reaction at the level of the

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,270
signups.
And uh,

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,560
and this is serious,
overreaction leads to a

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,290
changes in the connection.
The synopsis changes that include both

6
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,160
the,
uh,

7
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,460
uh,
the,

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,960
uh,
I was just say

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,280
changes in the receptors are located.
The signups is such that these receptors

10
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:50,870
respond in a different way and change in
the release of neurotransmitter of the

11
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:54,830
sign opsis and eventually changes in
the,

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,470
uh,
the level of the morphology of the

13
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,413
signups,

14
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,870
uh,
such debt.

15
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,370
There was enough,
Dick response becomes much,

16
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,550
much stronger and even an addition to
that for this memory to last long,

17
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,900
there have to be changes in the,
uh,

18
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,430
at the level of the genes that
the top part of our DNA and,

19
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:30,210
uh,
that are long lasting so that our

20
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:35,211
genetic changes with the formation of
new proteins in the cells that uh,

21
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,880
uh,
wouldn't live.

22
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,430
And it's a sign,
it's,

23
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,060
it's changed in the,
over their eyes.

24
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:53,770
It's plastic changes.
Or like as far as more protein,

25
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:57,190
a new proteins formed at this.
I have the signups.

26
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,260
You say men wanting pass through similar
processes to save our point first year,

27
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:07,850
memorize what I'm saying.
Then you consolidate this something that

28
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:09,950
you can recall it when you need to
remember.

29
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,140
Then you can reconsolidate it's a
process which has several

30
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,300
steps are phases.

31
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,010
I bet that it depends on the particular
moment in which you are trying to recall

32
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,360
that memory on certain processes that
uh,

33
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,290
no longer happen in the brain or they
are blocked,

34
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,500
some chemical reaction occur and they
interfere or did not occur and interfere

35
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:49,040
with this process of recalling in a
certain moment.

36
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,020
And then,
uh,

37
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,800
then,
uh,

38
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,090
two shown some data still remember it.
Maybe because you make an association

39
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,190
something in that moment that the house
too,

40
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,270
like,
you know,

41
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,110
so if you associate something with a
particular older,

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,700
I make an example and then the other
camps,

43
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,210
then the memory comes up.
It's just those options.

44
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,320
It's also to remember,
well,

45
00:03:19,621 --> 00:03:24,621
I mean
obviously I bet that smell is much more

46
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:27,510
important for a dog.
And then few months,

47
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,140
although there are humans or exercise
their sense of this male and afforded a

48
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,770
probably much better than I am now.

49
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,160
I mean,
there is differences between St Louis a

50
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,050
way of learning according to the people
and we're not the same.

51
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,160
Uh,
it's like a door that send people a is

52
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,650
more open one door,
then another sword or so they use it one

53
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:58,290
particular way more than others.
So there are differences.

54
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:03,291
But if we accept to the way in which the
memory gets in the chemical process that

55
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,010
once this thing is getting that they're
very,

56
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:10,590
very similar inside of the brain.
They are very,

57
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:13,440
very similar for different,
uh,

58
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,890
um,
call input of memory coming from

59
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,420
different ways through different
mechanisms.

60
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,330
And they're very similar in humans and
they're very similar in between the

61
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:24,360
different animals.
