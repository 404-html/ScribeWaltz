1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,940
Sure,
I'm not far from [inaudible],

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,580
which I mentioned is a ps 28,
which is bed Stuy,

3
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:11,900
the other side of Atlantic Avenue.
Uh,

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,290
this is a school where over 40 percent
of the kids are homeless.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,700
Uh,
and uh,

6
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:18,490
the,
the principal there is 30 for a highly.

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,290
It's a highly,
highly effective school,

8
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,160
high performing school.
Um,

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,560
the principal there,
she,

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,920
when I,
when I took a tour there last year,

11
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:29,080
she introduced me to his secretary.
She said,

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,380
I've trained my secretary to do most of
my administrative jobs.

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,240
I said,
well,

14
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,380
what do you do?
She says,

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,130
I am the lead teacher at the school.
I'm in classrooms all day.

16
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:42,460
I work with teachers and I teach the
kids.

17
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:45,970
The teachers don't know how to teach
because I want to make it clear to my

18
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:48,880
teachers that I didn't become a
principal to escape the classroom.

19
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,340
I became a principal to be the leader of
the classrooms.

20
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,390
And I watched her as she interacted
with,

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,090
with teachers and it was very clear that
she saw them as colleagues,

22
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:01,660
as part of a team that even though she
was clearly the leader,

23
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,540
she was also there to support them.
Uh,

24
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:05,830
and uh,
at one point I said,

25
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:07,030
well,
how do you get along with your union?

26
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:08,920
She said,
let me introduce you to my union Rep.

27
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,750
and it was very clear that they were
partners in this effort and working well

28
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:14,590
together.
So,

29
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,350
you know,
what she has is something that is very

30
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:20,560
difficult to teach a is,
which is a high degree of social

31
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:23,050
intelligence.
She knows how to work with people.

32
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:24,940
She knows how to bring the best out of
people.

33
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,700
She knows how to read people and
understand their strengths.

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,560
Uh,
at one point when I was listening at

35
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:30,470
school,
um,

36
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,900
she said she took me to a,
a small office where there was an older

37
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:36,700
man counseling a little boy.

38
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,000
And I said,
uh,

39
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,310
she said,
you see that man there?

40
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:40,210
I said,
yeah.

41
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:41,510
And she says,
uh,

42
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,960
I got him from the rubber room.
Now a,

43
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:47,860
those people who don't know New York or
the rubber room is a place where they

44
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:52,861
put a teachers and school staff that
nobody wants and they stay there

45
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:56,410
indefinitely and get paid and it's a,
it's a really horrendous situation.

46
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,300
So I said to her,
I said,

47
00:01:58,301 --> 00:01:59,830
how did you know to get them out of the
rubber room?

48
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:00,730
She said,
well,

49
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,460
I don't know why he was there,
but he had been my counselor when I was

50
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,980
a kid in school.
So when I heard he was in the rubber

51
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:07,980
room,
I asked for him and I bought into my

52
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,260
school.
So I sat in and I introduced myself.

53
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,840
They introduced me to the little boy who
was there talking to him.

54
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,410
So I'm.
The counselor said,

55
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,250
well,
ask this little boy why he's here today.

56
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:20,230
So I said,
why are you here for about eight years

57
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:20,890
old?
He says,

58
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,680
I'm learning how to be good,
so you learn how to be good.

59
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,760
I said,
is it working?

60
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,090
He said,
I hope so because I'm tired of getting

61
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:31,960
in trouble all the time.
And what struck me was it was,

62
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,730
it was,
it was a conversation,

63
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:37,080
it was a friendly conversation going on
between this older man,

64
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,560
his little boy.
It wasn't about,

65
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,230
we're going to throw you out of school,
we're going to punish you.

66
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:45,430
It was about trying to really get at the
roots of helping this boy learn to

67
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:49,540
become responsible for his own behavior.
Not Enough schools do that.

68
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,070
Students

69
00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:00,070
would rather watch a big thing for video
than sit and read a long

70
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,620
page of text in a textbook.
They have an opportunity to get the

71
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:09,130
information that they wouldn't
necessarily otherwise have.

72
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,100
We're using the technologies to connect,
to learn.

73
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:16,180
Students can participate by using the
Internet to their advantage.
