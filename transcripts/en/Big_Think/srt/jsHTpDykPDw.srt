1
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,820
The idea was
solving social problems

2
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,710
is different than solving business
problems.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,800
It takes strategy,
it takes research,

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,580
it takes careful analysis,
but it also takes a different set of

5
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:27,290
tools and we saw a lot of terrific tools
being developed in the business context

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,260
to make companies competitive and
profitable and successful.

7
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,130
We didn't see a similar set of tools
being as widely developed in the

8
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:39,050
nonprofit sector and so we wanted to
create a firm that brought the same kind

9
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:44,051
of analysis and strategy and reasoning
and research into solving social issues

10
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,660
for foundations,
for nonprofits and for corporations.

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,690
We often deal with funders,
charitable funders,

12
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:54,170
whether it's foundations or private
foundations or corporate foundations or

13
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:58,700
even individual philanthropists.
And one of the first barriers is the

14
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:03,650
fact that people don't really expect to
solve social problems through their

15
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:07,820
philanthropy.
They would like to pick a good cause,

16
00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:11,750
a worthy organization,
give that organization money and that's

17
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:12,740
a great thing to do.

18
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,180
But there's a real problem with our
nonprofit sector today in this country.

19
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,310
You know,
we have the most vibrant,

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,670
most creative,
largest nonprofit sector in the world.

21
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,040
And yet,
when you look at where the United States

22
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:28,280
stands on social issues,
on things like education,

23
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,830
things like healthcare,
things like the environment,

24
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,470
we're at the bottom of the list of
developed countries.

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,090
So somehow on the one hand we have this
wonderful nonprofit sector and on the

26
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:40,190
other hand,
we're not solving the problems that the

27
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:42,230
nonprofit sector is supposed to be
solving.

28
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,300
So there's a real basic problem there
and we believe the problem really has to

29
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:52,301
do with the behavior of donors that
donors are not expecting or demanding

30
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:56,360
results.
They aren't being realistic and

31
00:01:56,361 --> 00:02:00,470
strategic in their giving to actually
try and solve the problem.

32
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:06,190
And without that incentive,
nonprofits respond to the way donors

33
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:11,480
think currently rather than focus in on
how can they actually achieve a

34
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:12,560
meaningful impact on

35
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,760
the organization that they should
choose.

36
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,970
Um,
I,

37
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,040
I guess the best way to think about it
is a,

38
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,000
we did a very interesting engagement for
the gates foundation and they came to us

39
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:35,330
and they said we'd like to help
encourage more effective philanthropy.

40
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,030
Not more money,
but more effective practices,

41
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,490
but we're not really sure what that
means.

42
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,610
So what does it mean to be effective in
philanthropy?

43
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,510
And so they asked us to go out and
interview a couple dozen donors,

44
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,680
high net worth donors,
people who give away at least a million

45
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,260
dollars a year,
but people who are perceived as being

46
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:57,890
highly effective in their philanthropy.
And to be honest,

47
00:02:57,891 --> 00:03:01,060
we didn't think this engagement going to
work because we were talking to all

48
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:02,310
kinds of donors,
you know,

49
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,131
men,
women,

50
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:03,911
young,
old,

51
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:05,290
inherited wealth,
real estate,

52
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:09,190
new technology all across the country.
But we actually found something very

53
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:12,610
interesting that all of these donors
came into philanthropy.

54
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,570
They were responding to requests.
They were being a good citizen.

55
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,150
They didn't really see any impact for
their money.

56
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,780
They could give away millions of dollars
and nothing seemed to change and they

57
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:27,781
were kind of discouraged and at some
point they came across an issue that had

58
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:31,120
real urgency and real personal
significance to them.

59
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,380
So in one case,
someone son had a rare brain disease and

60
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,990
there wasn't much research.
In another case,

61
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:41,380
there was a beautiful theater downtown
that was going to be torn down as a

62
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:44,650
development.
And what happened was they stopped

63
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:48,160
thinking about how do I give away money?
And they started thinking about how do I

64
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:53,161
solve a specific problem and it changed
completely how they went about things.

65
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,190
So instead of saying which charity do I
write a check to or so on,

66
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,160
they said,
what would have to happen for this

67
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:05,161
problem to be solved and how can we take
responsibility for making those things

68
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:08,740
happen?
And it's really this problem solving

69
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:13,720
approach to philanthropy that we see as
the core difference between effective

70
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:18,721
philanthropists and most of the very
well meaning well intentioned people out

71
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:21,270
there who given away a lot of money but
aren't really seeing.
