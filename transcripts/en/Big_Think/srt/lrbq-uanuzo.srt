1
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,390
Here's why I wrote big guns.
I had served in Congress for 16 years

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,090
and in those 16 years,
um,

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,630
I witnessed a shooting at a university
in Virginia shooting at a movie theater

4
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:20,280
in Aurora,
Colorado,

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,590
shooting at a nightclub in Orlando,
shooting at an elementary school,

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,120
uh,
in Connecticut.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,350
And after every single one of those mass
shootings,

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,120
I in virtually every one of my
colleagues were confronted with the same

9
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:38,730
question.
And that is when is congress going to do

10
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:40,830
something about it?
When will this stop?

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,430
Not necessarily when we'll converse to
everything about it,

12
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:47,490
but just do something,
do universal background checks or,

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,550
uh,
some common sense legislation.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,150
And when my constituents in New York
would ask that question,

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,410
I knew that the honest answer and the
painful answer was we're not,

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,490
congress is not going to do anything
because of the politics that surrounded

17
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:03,600
the gun safety debate.

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,100
And I decided to try and answer that
question in the best way I can.

19
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,160
And that is,
uh,

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,880
with snark,
uh,

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,220
with humor.
And from the very inside of Congress,

22
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:17,370
I wrote this book during hearings on gun
safety.

23
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:20,040
I wrote this book on the floor of the
House of Representatives.

24
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:24,480
I wrote this book on that little balcony
off the floor of the House of

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,300
Representatives where members go to rest
while they're not beating each other up,

26
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,440
uh,
inside.

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,160
And so this book is really,
it's reflection of what I learned as a

28
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:36,180
member of Congress.
And it is my way of explaining to

29
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:41,181
readers why Congress seems so paralyzed
in the face of this mass violence,

30
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,500
uh,
that is affecting so many communities.

31
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:47,610
And so many of our constituents,
90% of the American people support

32
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:52,611
strengthened background checks of about
80% of Republicans support,

33
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:56,910
strengthened background checks.
A majority of NRA members support

34
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:58,440
strengthened background checks.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,650
And yet when we offered this amendment
for stronger background checks and the

36
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:03,840
appropriations committee,
it was defeated,

37
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,550
uh,
virtually in a party line vote.

38
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,930
And I was wrestling with this.
Why would members of Congress vote

39
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:12,570
against something that has such massive
support?

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,330
Well,
I learned the lesson and the lesson is

41
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:16,650
reflected in big guns.
After that,

42
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,663
uh,
hearing,

43
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,750
uh,
I went to one of the most sacred places,

44
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,770
uh,
on Capitol Hill,

45
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,040
not a church.
Uh,

46
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,580
but the members only elevator.
And the reason that's sacred,

47
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,200
it's because on the members only
elevator,

48
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,960
you can't have tourists and can't have
the media in,

49
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:32,790
can't have staff.
And uh,

50
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:37,020
and so you reach a real level of
confidentiality in that cramped space.

51
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,860
And a bunch of members piled onto this
elevator after the committee meeting and

52
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,770
one of the Republicans on this elevator
said,

53
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:45,850
why did you try and force us to vote
for,

54
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,490
you know,
for this amendment for background

55
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:48,324
checks?

56
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:48,931
And I said,
well,

57
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:51,450
we didn't force you to do anything.
You voted against it.

58
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,380
A,
my question to you is,

59
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,350
why would you vote against it?
And this member looked at me and said,

60
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,380
I wanted to vote for it,
but I can't go home and explain that

61
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:03,490
vote to my gun lobby voters.
It would be the end of my career.

62
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,880
That tells you everything you need to
know about why Congress seems so

63
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:09,070
paralyzed.
It's just say one other thing on this.

64
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,390
After every mass shooting,
the entire country has galvanized.

65
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:14,620
They want to mobilize.
I mean,

66
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:16,330
think about what happened after park
land.

67
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,231
You know,
we,

68
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,650
it was so certain that Congress was
going to pass something.

69
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,380
There were rallies and marches and uh,
you know,

70
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:26,860
everybody was talking about it.
But now we're months from Parkland and

71
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:28,360
what does Congress done?
Nothing.

72
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,470
I wrote this book.

73
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,470
So Congress people will be reminded that
the solution to this is in the congress

74
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:38,770
and they have to keep pressuring their
members of Congress to pass meaningful

75
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:43,210
reforms that will make our kids safer.
I did not want to write big guns as my

76
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:47,080
personal screed against the,
the NRA and the gun lobby.

77
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,570
Uh,
I thought the best and most credible way

78
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:53,440
of writing this book was to bring
different characters in with different

79
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,550
viewpoints.
And by the way,

80
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:56,980
that's what congress is like.
It's different characters with different

81
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:58,080
viewpoints.
Uh,

82
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,680
and I felt that the best way to tell
this story a was as a satire.

83
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:04,870
But you know,
all set tire has to be based on a kernel

84
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:09,150
of truth.
And the truth in this book is that the

85
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,480
fact that Congress does nothing,
the book was actually based on a and

86
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,510
extraordinary and a shocking event after
the Sandy Hook massacre that,

87
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:22,480
uh,
that killed children in this elementary

88
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:23,320
school in Connecticut.

89
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,290
I was reading a sitting,
having breakfast right after that.

90
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:30,730
I was so convinced that we in Congress,
we're finally going to do something when

91
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,140
first graders,
uh,

92
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:35,200
our gun down,
it would seem that Congress would do

93
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:39,170
something and my confidence was really
high and I was having breakfast and I

94
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:42,520
was reading my New York Times one
morning and I came upon this article,

95
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,460
uh,
and I could have sworn that the New York

96
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:48,340
Times had been infiltrated by the
writers of the onion.

97
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,560
Uh,
because it seems so bizarre.

98
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:55,000
The story was that while most state and
local governments were actually passing

99
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,900
local ordinances for gun safety,
because Congress would do nothing,

100
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,290
the small city of Nelson,
Georgia decided that they would go in a

101
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:06,220
different direction.
This small city passed a local ordinance

102
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:10,120
requiring that every resident of this
city must possess a firearm.

103
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,130
And that was my kernel of truth.

104
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,060
And when I saw that I said,
first I had to figure out whether it was

105
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:19,390
actually true.
And then when I realized that it was

106
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:22,210
true,
I decided to build a satire round.

107
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,500
This only instead of making it a
applicable to one small city in Georgia,

108
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,940
I federalized it.
Uh,

109
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,950
I create this law that requires that
every American must own a firearm,

110
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,440
uh,
that works its way through congress.

111
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,410
Now,
if I had just written about the process,

112
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:42,430
it would be a maybe a slightly lighter
version of the congressional record,

113
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,910
still very boring.
And so I decided I had to weave into it

114
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:49,420
real characters and I had to make sure
that the characters express different

115
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:53,350
viewpoints because the gun debate is in
Philly is influenced by so many

116
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:54,910
different viewpoints.
Uh,

117
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:59,480
so it was important to me that this
story reflect both sides of the issue,

118
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:03,980
but also make the point that Congress
will not act because of the politics

119
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:07,820
that surrounds us and the fear that so
many of my colleagues have,

120
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,460
uh,
not that their constituents are going to

121
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:11,840
be shot,
uh,

122
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,920
but that their careers may be ended if
they take on the NRA and the gun lobby.
