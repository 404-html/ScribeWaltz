1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,240
Yeah,
yeah.

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,450
Kept trying to get this interview.
So what could the second blank dollars

3
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:12,770
to,
how many houses can you you use private?

4
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:14,780
How many jumps can you own?
So give the,

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:19,400
give the rest of it away.
But if I were giving money away,

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,620
I would probably give it mostly to
direct service providers as people

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,480
actually,
or they're actually doing research say

8
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:28,250
for giving me cancer research for AIDS
research.

9
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:31,550
The actual researchers and the people
actually providing on the ground

10
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:34,820
services to peel because there's plenty
of think tanks.

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,910
There's plenty of things that get a lot
of money to turn a lot of position

12
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:39,440
papers and some of them are usable
position papers.

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,880
Board tend to be underfunded by private
donors today or people give him the

14
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:47,420
services on the ground.
Little things that aren't sexy.

15
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,990
Soup Kitchens,
food closets,

16
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,200
things like that.
Those are desperately under funded by

17
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:57,560
private donors or give to the big issues
that get something named after yourself

18
00:00:57,561 --> 00:00:58,100
and so on.

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,310
I think if money mainly to causes like
that and something else,

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,240
I think I might give away money to
establish writing programs,

21
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,370
um,
writing programs,

22
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:10,160
especially in the inner city,
but elsewhere as well in rural areas,

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,300
places where a lot of times,
or it can certainly go to school,

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,400
they don't get the individual
encouragement to think about the

25
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:18,200
possible you may have the talent to be a
writer.

26
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:21,830
Let's try it out and,
and see you saying that people tend to

27
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,900
ride a lot.
10 of people think a lot and we need

28
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:25,460
more.
People will think a lot and I'd like to

29
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:26,060
encourage that.
