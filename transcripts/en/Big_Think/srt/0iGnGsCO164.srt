1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,890
You know,
in the history of our industry,

2
00:00:01,891 --> 00:00:02,724
there have been some real major events 
that have transformed the industry and 

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,243
had a huge impact in our lives.
The invention of the integrated circuit 

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,493
really opened up a huge number of 
opportunities to do things that were 

5
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:17,940
unimaginable back then than the creation
of the personal computer.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,690
The PC.
That was a huge impact on our lives,

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,850
not only in our own personal lives,
but in the way industry conducted itself

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,630
and how they use computers to do the 
things that were important to them.

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,840
Then the third thing was the 
introduction.

10
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:34,860
Of course,
if they internet,

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,660
I mean that Internet with pcs and the 
integrated circuit.

12
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:42,210
You can see how old that is building and
and changing the world.

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,103
I believe that the next step is going to
be what's called cognitive computing 

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,123
because technology has changed so much 
that we have not so much power in our 

15
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:50,724
computing capability and so much memory 
that we can store that we're able for 

16
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:55,824
the first time to actually create 
products that begin to mimic how the 

17
00:00:59,041 --> 00:00:59,874
brain works and what that means is that 
the product can actually on a very 

18
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:06,690
narrow,
particularly expertise,

19
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,660
could be as narrow as let's say weather 
forecasting for example,

20
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,170
or something very narrow that the 
product begins to learn.

21
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,350
I see these youths in and in a way that 
means he has some cognitive capability,

22
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,643
so the more you use it,
the better it becomes at a particular 

23
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:23,364
function to the point.
It actually gets to a point where he 

24
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:28,410
begins to actually ask questions of.
You.

25
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,490
Think of it as a child.
You know when a child is born a,

26
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:35,640
their brain is empty,
begins to get filled with stuff.

27
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:36,893
Hopefully mostly good,
but when it comes to a point in time 

28
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:42,930
when the child touches a hot plate and 
the mother says hot,

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,610
then the child knows from then on,
every time somebody says hot,

30
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,043
he better be careful because now his 
program in his brain and he's learning 

31
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,410
continues to learn.
But there comes that time in the child's

32
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,303
life that all of us that have been 
parents either dread or look forward to 

33
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:04,210
is when the child starts asking why,
you know,

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,020
when you do something and say why,
why,

35
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,883
why,
and where the child is doing is 

36
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:09,354
learning.

37
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,283
He now has enough cognitive capability 
to understand enough of what's going on 

38
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,890
but not enough so that he laughs.
Why?

39
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,143
Well,
in the same way these circuits get to a 

40
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:22,890
point where actually they begin to query
back and say,

41
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:24,840
I need more information.
Give me more information.

42
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,120
Tell me about this.
And uh,

43
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:29,490
there are some experiments going today 
on healthcare,

44
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,893
in oil exploration,
in financial transactions where they 

45
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:36,480
actually begin to tap the power of 
cognitive computing.

46
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,793
And I believe that when that happens,
we're going to enter an era of that's 

47
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,103
unimaginable today.
And in some ways is kind of exciting to 

48
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:49,560
think of the fact that we could,
surrounded by intelligence that helps us

49
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,010
make our lives better,
but it's also somewhat frightening.

50
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:53,844
And the fact that you're now surrounded 
by intelligence that begins to think 

51
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:58,140
they know more than you do.
And,

52
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:58,860
and,
uh,

53
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,400
but we're moving to that direction.

54
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,703
I see it happening.
I think we're about 10 years away from 

55
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:07,330
that being a real commercial reality.
However,

56
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:08,164
the work I've seen done in healthcare in
oil exploration and financial 

57
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:15,580
transactions tells me that this thing is
very real.

58
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,660
And I'll give you one small example of 
how powerful it can be.

59
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,360
A cannot disclose the names of the 
companies,

60
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:23,194
but in one particular example is they've
looked at the data on a particular 

61
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:29,460
medicine that was used to,
you know,

62
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,493
to treat patients.
And the way things had been done up to 

63
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:35,890
now is you get a medicine,
you get FDA approval,

64
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,023
and then you put it out and then you 
collect data and about 10 years later 

65
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:40,830
you say,
you know,

66
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,340
I'd,
we're going to take the medicine off the

67
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:46,060
market because it's causing some major 
problem.

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,393
Um,
well they took an example like that and 

69
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,790
say,
let's pretend that we had this cognitive

70
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:56,200
capability back then and fitted the data
that we had and see what happens.

71
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,770
Well,
this actually cognitive machine was able

72
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:04,771
to predict within a matter of weeks of 
the product being on the market,

73
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,103
what took 10 years of collecting data so
you can see how powerful something like 

74
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:12,934
that could be.
And what he does is because the 

75
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,663
computing capabilities so fast and the 
amount of memory so large in a very 

76
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:24,760
narrow segment,
it can do what let's say 10,000

77
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:25,594
people would do if you could get them 
all together in one room to look at one 

78
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:29,560
problem.
And so it is,

79
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,930
I see this to me,
uh,

80
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,190
as a next revolution in technology and 
will impact everything that we do.
