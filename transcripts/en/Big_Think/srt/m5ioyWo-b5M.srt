1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,370
If your honor has this unique ability to
really take you there.

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,350
And that's sort of a,
something I've been trying to do.

3
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:15,630
And,
and traditional still images and

4
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:17,620
documentary film and,
and,

5
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:20,640
and those mediums have have great power
to influence.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,890
But I was always frustrated with the
inability to really take a first person

7
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:30,210
subjective experience and let someone
see it for themselves.

8
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:35,211
And vr can start to do that.
I can place people into worlds that they

9
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:40,731
may never otherwise see and experience
something firsthand in a way that is

10
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:46,911
very different than watching a film.
You recall it as a memory instead of I

11
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:51,990
saw a movie,
I actually was there in this experience.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,140
And so those memories actually encode in
a,

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,510
um,
in a stronger way.

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,540
And I think that allows us to reflect
and process them in a,

15
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:05,520
in a,
in a more personal way.

16
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,400
Uh,
you have an emotional connection,

17
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,690
uh,
and you get as close to being in their

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,020
position as possible.
It's not completely a first person

19
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:19,080
perspective.
And there's some testing and research

20
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:22,350
around that where it could be actually
embody someone else that's a little bit

21
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:25,000
harder.
But right now we know we can bet least

22
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:28,200
be very close.
And when you are very close to someone

23
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:30,870
and you're seeing what they're
experiencing,

24
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,160
you start to internalize that we have
these mirror neurons that we can feel

25
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,700
what other people are feeling.
And that reflection that I think is

26
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:43,701
invoked from these powerful experiences
can start to foster empathy,

27
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,080
uh,
for the other.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,320
And it can dissolve your own ego and
help you take the perspective of someone

29
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:56,250
else.
And I think this special ability of Vr

30
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,420
is really important for the,
the,

31
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:02,700
the urgent crises that we're facing.
Uh,

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,760
especially climate change,
which can be hard to dig into,

33
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:12,951
to really lean into because it seems so
big and abstract and um,

34
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,300
but when you are experiencing climate
change right in the places that,

35
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,500
uh,
it's,

36
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:22,470
it's happening,
you feel like it's,

37
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:27,240
it's here that you're getting this
glimpse into the future of a world of

38
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:29,060
extreme weather,
of,

39
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:33,630
of dried out desert conditions,
of refugees,

40
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,580
of pristine ecosystems collapsing and
being destroyed.

41
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,380
And so when you can actually experience
these events as if you were there,

42
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,770
you internalize them.
And I think that starts to lead to this

43
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:48,150
process of,
well,

44
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:52,470
am I participating in it?
Am I consuming fossil fuels that I don't

45
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:56,430
need to?
Can I divest from some of the industries

46
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,790
that are responsible for this crisis?
And so I think that reflection is really

47
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:07,861
important because it leads to,
or as necessary to lead to action in

48
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:12,520
one's own life.
And there's a whole threshold of

49
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:15,490
different actions one can take to engage
with,

50
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,770
uh,
this,

51
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:19,750
this incredible environmental problem
that we're facing.

52
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,830
And so,
you know,

53
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:23,740
this chain of events I think can be
triggered,

54
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,870
um,
through a singular,

55
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:29,200
powerful experience.
And so with this medium,

56
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,840
we can convey,
uh,

57
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,890
not just information.
We can convey emotional fidelity in a

58
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:39,550
way that we haven't been able to do,
um,

59
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,680
with,
with such clarity.

60
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,980
And so we can really feel what it's like
to be a mother in the deserts of

61
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,530
Somalia,
uh,

62
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,830
trying to find food for her children,
um,

63
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,630
and,
and having to flee to the outskirts of

64
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:57,490
cities into huge,
uh,

65
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,010
camps.
Um,

66
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,300
and,
and seeing that they're really just

67
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:05,140
trying to care for their families just
as we would do if we were there.

68
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,560
And so I think it has this ability to
help us,

69
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,860
um,
invoke the empathy that we all have and

70
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:16,360
cultivate the compassion and the action
that is needed to address so many of the

71
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:16,870
world's problems.
