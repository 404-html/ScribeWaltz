00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:10,621
Well,
you know,

2
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:14,120
I have a blog and I've actually written
quite a bit on this because you know,

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,420
if the US capital markets in terms of
sophistication or a 10,

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,910
China's a two.
Okay.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,450
So China's got a long way to in the
capital markets in China.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,500
Like when I went to Wall Street in 1973,
they were about as developed as that

7
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:29,490
was.
Okay.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,410
So you know,
that's a,

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,470
that's a negative in one sense,
but I think that China could learn a lot

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,200
from what's happened over the list of
the last 10 days,

11
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:41,370
two years,
whatever you want to,

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,970
whatever timeframe you want to pick.
Because the US market has gotten so

13
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:46,320
sophisticated,
so big,

14
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:49,740
so complicated and you know,
now everybody's scratching their head

15
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:50,131
and saying,
hey,

16
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:51,960
how do we regulate this?
How do we control it?

17
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:54,330
How do we prevent,
prevent this from happening again?

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,220
This gives China a gigantic opportunity
to really look at all this would have

19
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,580
everybody's gonna be analyzing and
studying about this whole crisis and

20
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:08,010
then to think to themselves about how
they then go about the process of taking

21
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:11,490
their capital markets up the curve.
So you know,

22
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,500
in many ways being the second or the
last kid on the block is a lot of times

23
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:20,340
an advantage because you get to kind of
see where everybody else has gone

24
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:21,870
through and kind of learn from their
experience.

25
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:25,290
And I think that the child would be well
served to really look very,

26
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:29,280
very hard and really try to understand
how this all happened and then to think

27
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:32,970
about in the context of China and what
that means for how China's capital

28
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:33,210
market.
