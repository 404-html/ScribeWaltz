1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Um,
well,

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,880
it would involve work.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,170
I'm matt and it would probably involve
pasta and wine.

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,390
I can have wine in my last meal.
Right.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,070
Absolutely.
So,

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,940
um,
I had an amazing Harlan cab the other

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,210
night.
I'd have a harland cab and I'd have like

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,550
a really amazing was on yeah.
With beef,

9
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:34,390
pork,
veal,

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,430
and um,
you know,

11
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:39,700
with Mozzarella.
And it would be Julie and a rich and a

12
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:42,190
really filling,
and you know what?

13
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:45,250
I wouldn't be able to eat the last bite
and that would be great.

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,100
That would be my hope.

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,360
Last thought.
I'm falling happy.
