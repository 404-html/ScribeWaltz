1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,370
Well,
the most important issue is the one we

2
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:13,640
just talked about because we're so
mishandling and at this point in time

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,610
and that is what is America's proper
role in the world.

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,990
The second big issue I think is that
this society is not improving.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,320
One of the things that we've lost
somehow in the United States,

6
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:33,650
which the puritans brought to us in the
beginning,

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,040
was the notion that individual human
beings and societies where the largest

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,770
mall should always be trying to improve
themselves.

9
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:46,670
They should be trying to learn more.
They should be trying to improve their

10
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,570
character,
their service.

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,610
There are all kinds of.
We've kind of lost that notion so that

12
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:56,840
self improvement has become a joke or it
means something like losing some weight

13
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,260
and we have as an we focused instead on
happiness and pleasure and enjoying life

14
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:05,900
and I think that's a very serious
problem for it.

15
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,900
We ought to talk about that and now
there are issues.

16
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:12,590
There was the healthcare financing
problem that we have in the United

17
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,390
States.
There is,

18
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,580
there's going to be an economic problem
that we have is coming up.

19
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,540
There are those kinds of issues,
but the really big ones are the ones

20
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:21,470
that are,
what are we about?

21
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:23,990
What are we about in the world and what
are we about at home?
