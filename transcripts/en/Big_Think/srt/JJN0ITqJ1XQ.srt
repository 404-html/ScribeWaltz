1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,140
We should not exaggerate at over Sweden
we are also and more and more

2
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,460
heterogeneous society.
But uh,

3
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,070
if American economists,
politicians,

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,960
once you look around to see how how
other countries have fared and they've

5
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:31,700
met the same global environment as
America has met,

6
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,040
then there might be some things to pick
up.

7
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,950
And we have been subject not to the
same,

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,960
but to more intense competitive
pressures from new emerging economies.

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,780
We have not done your China,
Vietnam,

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,840
India as new competitors compared to
what was there 15 or 20 years ago.

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,380
We also have next door Poland,
the Baltic republics,

12
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,880
Russia with a highly educated workforce
with very,

13
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:02,150
very low wages,
perhaps 10% of the wages paid in my

14
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:06,620
country and the Rsa one hour away from
us.

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,160
So we have faced more intense
globalization

16
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,290
then the American economy and facing
more or less the same pressures.

17
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,040
We have increased employment,
increased rate wages,

18
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,790
also for blue collar workers were
maintained strong support for open

19
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:29,480
borders and we've been able to develop
our society.

20
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,710
Whereas in the United States,
people are afraid of foreign

21
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:36,770
competition.
Real wages have declined.

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Employment has not risen very much.
And I think to blame technological

23
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:47,711
change and globalization in the United
States cannot be true if the same

24
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:51,890
elements have led to a completely
different outcome in a country like

25
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:54,830
mine.
But my country is a small open economy

26
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,110
with a very high level of education and
a sophisticated social model.

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,560
I do not say that what we do can be
transformed into an new American

28
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,870
modeling in 10 minutes.
But,

29
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:10,820
uh,
please have a look and see what there is

30
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:12,660
the pickup of,
uh,

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,800
of inspiration from a model that isn't
very different but has stood the test of

32
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:21,350
globalization much better than the
American model.

33
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,860
We continue to intensify.
It will affect more areas.

34
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,200
It will include more countries and in
each country it will include more and

35
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:35,860
more sectors.
And uh,

36
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,460
together with technological change,
which I believe is an underestimated

37
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,870
force behind the changes we have seen
and we are seeing together,

38
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:49,871
they will continue to transform our
countries and the global economy.

39
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,690
Globalization to me,
it means not only financial markets,

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,440
not only trade in products like cars,
it also means culture,

41
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,030
news,
perception of the world,

42
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,800
and,
uh,

43
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,490
all kinds of other things.
Maybe we should call it under the label

44
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,490
that the world is shrinking.
Borders mean less.

45
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,680
The Internet means that we can
communicate more and more people speak a

46
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:20,970
language where they can communicate with
people in other parts of the,

47
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,390
of,
of the planet.

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,960
All these things together work to shrink
distances.

49
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,270
And that is a much,
much larger,

50
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,440
much,
much wider concept and only interest

51
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:38,160
rates,
shares and uh,

52
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,500
and physical goods moving around.
Yeah.

53
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,270
Yeah.
