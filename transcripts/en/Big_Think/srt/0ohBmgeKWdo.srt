1
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,450
I think it's pretty scary.
I mean,

2
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,200
I,
but you know,

3
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:14,510
it's,
I don't have a lot,

4
00:00:14,511 --> 00:00:15,500
but you know,
it's all,

5
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:17,690
it all sounds pretty political at the 
end of the day.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,553
Um,
and without getting political and all 

7
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:21,530
that kind of stuff,
it just,

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,090
I think the big unfortunate thing is,
is that as soon as it starts to hit home

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,240
and it starts to affect us,
then there seems to be,

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,210
uh,
an effect,

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,433
you know,
then there seems to be a reaction if 

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,490
there's outreach.
But if you look around the world,

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,340
this is,
this is normal for a lot of people.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,413
This is actually,
it's surprising that it's even a 

15
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:46,730
surprise to people.
It's shocking that it's a shock.

16
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:51,050
It's shocking to me that nobody takes 
responsibility for,

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,650
for,
uh,

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,893
you know,
a world that someone in chaos right now 

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,620
and has been for a number of years.
This is,

20
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,990
none of this is new.
Um,

21
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,660
so that being said,
without getting all dreary and stuff,

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,490
uh,
it's been around for a long time and,

23
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,910
uh,
I think we all have responsibility.

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,063
Yup.

25
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,863
Do you know,
I'm sure it's a matter of time that it 

26
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:21,690
will,
um,

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,330
you know,
I think like everything else,

28
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,160
hopefully we'll get through it.
Uh,

29
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,630
when it,
when it does happen,

30
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,850
I hope it doesn't happen,
but I'm sure it will.

31
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,190
Uh,
and all we could do is,

32
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,740
is kind of,
you know,

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,430
put our heads down and hunker down,
so to speak,

34
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,550
and do what we have to do to get to get 
through it.

35
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,423
Okay.

36
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,663
I don't think we have a choice in the 
matter of these laws are getting passed 

37
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:53,690
and,
and,

38
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,810
uh,
and people are being affected and,

39
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,980
and you know,
eventually,

40
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,570
uh,
I think,

41
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:01,040
you know,
it's a matter of time before,

42
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,380
uh,
before fall,

43
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:05,630
guys just out outright banned.
Um,

44
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,360
but you know,
this is,

45
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,760
it's call it what you will,
I mean,

46
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:13,400
some people would say it's risky,
it's irresponsible to do it in the first

47
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:14,234
place.
All those would say it's responsible to 

48
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:15,740
it.
And Eh,

49
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,840
you know,
um,

50
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,020
in all that being said,
trans fats,

51
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:22,340
I mean,
the effect that it has on,

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,240
um,
uh,

53
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,650
is all politics and it's a matter of,
of,

54
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,080
you know,
standpoint.

55
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,370
I guess,
and all this,

56
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:36,020
all this is it's a little beyond me.
Just a simple cook,

57
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,970
opening a restaurant in east village

58
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,590
foods

59
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,800
set up clipping friends,
fats.

60
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:48,634
Anyway,
so it doesn't have an effect on me at 

61
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:52,650
all.
But I understand how a lot of people,

62
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,990
uh,
you know,

63
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:59,991
a lot of people need to live by fast 
food restaurants.

64
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:00,974
I mean,
it's sometimes the only food that they 

65
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:03,094
can afford.
So I would like to think in a perfect 

66
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:07,654
world that the,
that the fast food restaurants would 

67
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:12,640
take the responsibility to serve the 
foods a little bit healthier without the

68
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:14,260
government having having to get 
involved.

69
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,990
Um,
unfortunately it's just not the world we

70
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:18,310
live in.
Um,

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,300
and,
and not gonna,

72
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,403
you know,
I'm not going to be the boy that cried 

73
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:24,820
trans fats,
but will say that,

74
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,893
you know,
it's sometimes desperate times call for 

75
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:29,380
desperate measures.
Obviously

76
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,263
I happened

77
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,400
and I really think about it and I think 
it's a matter of evolution.

78
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,050
Evolution takes time.
And the way I think about,

79
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,273
you know,
eventually going into maybe a fine 

80
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:51,110
dining restaurant one day becomes the 
opportunity to kind of,

81
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,350
to,
to reign yourself in completely and take

82
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:58,040
a fine dining approach outside of the 
casual restaurants and things like that.

83
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,310
But a fine dining approached by reigning
yourself in and doing,

84
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,950
you know,
Dan Barber I think does it very well.

85
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,113
Uh,
even Michael Anthony does it very well 

86
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,150
and there's a lot of shifts that do.
And,

87
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:09,980
and of course I'm not going to go 
through the whole list,

88
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:12,950
but those are the two that really come 
to mind,

89
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,210
uh,
that,

90
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,590
you know,
Cook from the land,

91
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,280
the simplicity and the beauty of the 
product.

92
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,600
Um,
you know,

93
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:21,434
to listen to Dan,
Barbara speak about these things and 

94
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,500
his,
his eloquence with it.

95
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:25,910
It's,
I mean,

96
00:04:25,911 --> 00:04:27,140
it's like,
it's great.

97
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,240
So he's the guy you got to ask,
not me.

98
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,350
I do.
Absolutely.

99
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,100
I mean,
my,

100
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,080
my grandfather lost,
lost

101
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,620
his farm when my father was,
was young.

102
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,710
So there's always that,
you know,

103
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,990
it's in the back of my head.
Um,

104
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,360
and I still have family up in the north 
and main that live that are farmers.

105
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,800
Um,
it's uh,

106
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,683
you know,
you do what you can within the confines 

107
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,580
of Your Business and you know,
things being what they are and,

108
00:05:04,581 --> 00:05:07,660
and you know,
the economics of a restaurant being what

109
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:08,494
it is.
Sometimes it's unfortunate that you 

110
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:12,100
can't,
you know,

111
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,640
the difference between an organic egg 
and a commercial lake.

112
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:16,923
Now you look at the way a commercial leg
is raised and you look at the way an 

113
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,120
organic egg is raised.
You know,

114
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,400
unfortunately it costs more than three 
times.

115
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,500
The organic aid cost more than three 
times they commercially raised egg.

116
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,380
So the economics of a restaurant being 
what it is and you know,

117
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,810
occupancy costs of restaurants in New 
York City being what they are,

118
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,450
there's only so much you could do 
sometimes without,

119
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,873
you know,
customers are still price sensitive and 

120
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,970
savvy for that matter.
Obviously in New York City.

121
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,820
So you do what you can.
You,

122
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,270
you want to be responsible.
I never want to be a responsible.

123
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,403
Uh,
and hopefully what that means is that 

124
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:57,980
it's something that I can grow into more
and more over time.

125
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,690
Back to the evolution of it.

126
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,163
No,

127
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,780
I think that,
uh,

128
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,070
there's where there's a will,
there's a way,

129
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,113
you know,
uh,

130
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,273
it,
it seems to me that there's so much 

131
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:16,050
infrastructure,
uh,

132
00:06:16,051 --> 00:06:17,970
with,
with commercial farming,

133
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,440
commercial food products that it's easy.
That's an easy cop out,

134
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,873
right?
But if we put ourselves on a path to 

135
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:28,160
kind of get to that point,
you know,

136
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,033
maybe it may take time,
but eventually we'll get to the point 

137
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:32,700
where it is feasible

138
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,210
just called by restraint.

139
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,560
Maybe that last,
uh,

140
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,730
three bowls of ice cream I shouldn't 
have had.

141
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,570
I wasn't that fat is the kid.
But,

142
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:48,410
you know,
I mean there's,

143
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,580
there's,
you know,

144
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:51,410
I,
I was also a big baseball player and all

145
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,320
that kinds of things.
And,

146
00:06:52,321 --> 00:06:53,154
and,
uh,

147
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,040
I think,
you know,

148
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,873
the,
with the,

149
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,571
you know,
it's,

150
00:06:57,571 --> 00:06:58,860
it's,
it's always a concern,

151
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,630
right?
You want your children to be active.

152
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,180
You don't want them to sit in front of a
TV and playing video games.

153
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,400
I don't have kids,
so it's easier for me to,

154
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:08,760
to,
it's very easy for me as a non parent to

155
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,140
say,
this is what kids should do.

156
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,153
I'm not going to play that game again
