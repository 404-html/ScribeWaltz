1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,510
I think
relationship with

2
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,730
he hit a low in 2003.
The whole cast of characters apart from

3
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:25,170
Bush himself has now changed or
different leaders in Britain,

4
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,940
France and Germany,
the Italian moments come back again.

5
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,940
Um,
and I think,

6
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,260
you know,
the,

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,750
the,
the will in Europe is to make the

8
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:41,751
transatlantic relationship work.
And also I think the Putin now Medvedev

9
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:47,961
factor is making your opinions here,
remember why it's always quite useful to

10
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:53,901
have the merit to be with the Americans
and not feel scared or frightened were

11
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,870
in the cold.
What is preparing all these issues,

12
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,840
a reason to deal with it.
The Atlantic countries are working

13
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:02,870
together.
I,

14
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,930
it's the case.
This isn't a partisan point that

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,350
Europeans have been absolutely riveted
by,

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,140
by the election campaign.
Um,

17
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,410
and it's free for all sorts of reasons.
Uh,

18
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,250
probably rooting for Obama just because
he represented something so different

19
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,730
from,
from Bush that they can see the pr

20
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:33,990
advantages at home and we just not say
there will be unhappy with Hillary.

21
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,990
I think they would be fine with hillary
to shoot because they got on okay with

22
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:42,180
built towards the end.
I think people forget just how bad

23
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:44,850
transatlantic relations were in the
first term of,

24
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,840
of Clinton over Bosnia,
which was actually very difficult time

25
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:50,640
of need to.
By the end he was fine.

26
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,650
A Boma represent a different sort of
America.

27
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,830
Um,
and so I think he would have an unusual

28
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:01,080
opportunity.
Mccain would also,

29
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,680
we'll also have an opportunity to,
because he's recognized to be a

30
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,850
different emotion,
uh,

31
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,700
and uh,
but I think it'd be a concern that he

32
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:13,701
was carrying on the sort of a blustery
sort of foreign policy.

33
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,920
Whereas I think Europeans would like
more diplomacy,

34
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:24,921
heavy American foreign policy rather
than one that just relies on sort of

35
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,170
threats,
actual use of force.

36
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,420
So a transplant integrations aren't
really that bad,

37
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,340
I don't think.
But people are waiting as indeed

38
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,290
Americans are.
And I think 2009 will will be

39
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,950
potentially quite a quite an interesting
year in terms of whether you can see new

40
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,410
directions in western foreign policy in
general.
