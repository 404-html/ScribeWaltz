1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,100
I think cancer research right now is
that a very interesting place.

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,940
Um,
if you think about what has happened

3
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:16,410
over the last 25 years,
it has largely been identifying the

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,430
hundred to 200,
maybe slightly more than that,

5
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:25,050
genes in the human genome that are
involved one way or another in

6
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:28,260
controlling growth.
And because cancer is fundamentally a

7
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:33,261
disease where growth is uncontrolled,
the genes that are most important in

8
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:36,990
understanding cancer are those growth
control genes.

9
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:41,991
And we're getting close to what I think
is probably a comprehensive list of

10
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:48,591
those genes.
The next step is identifying which genes

11
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:53,100
are important in which kinds of cancer.
And I think we're making real progress

12
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:56,760
there as well.
Then comes the hard part.

13
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,150
And the hard part is turning that
knowledge into disease specific,

14
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,830
uh,
cancer treatments.

15
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,080
We have some early examples,
success stories in this area.

16
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:13,860
Herceptin,
which was developed for the treatment of

17
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:15,330
breast cancer,
uh,

18
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,450
leave act,
which was developed for the treatment of

19
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,370
a lymphoma.

20
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,750
Uh,
but,

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,310
uh,
I think they're going to be many,

22
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:27,090
many more in the future.
And what's really exciting about those

23
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:30,480
therapies is unlike,
uh,

24
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,110
therapies that exist today,
which are largely poisons,

25
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:39,111
poisons that target dividing cells.
These new therapies are very,

26
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:44,040
very specific and target the cancer cell
itself.

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,740
And what,
that's what I mean is that those drugs

28
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:50,250
are going to be far more effective than
the drugs we use today.

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,730
And importantly,
the quality of life of the patient is

30
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:58,170
going to be significantly better because
you're not killing off hundreds of other

31
00:01:58,171 --> 00:01:59,370
cells,
uh,

32
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:01,230
while you're trying to kill the cancer.
So,

33
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:08,660
okay.
