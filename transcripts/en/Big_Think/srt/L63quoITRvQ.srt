1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,600
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,770
yeah,
well human made,

3
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:15,771
global warming is caused by changes in
the atmosphere which are due to burning

4
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:19,710
fossil fuels,
primarily as we burn oil,

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,060
gas,
and coal.

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,240
This releases carbon dioxide to the
atmosphere.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,900
Carbon dioxide absorbs heat,
radiation from the earth and that traps

8
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:33,060
the heat radiation and makes the planet
a bit warmer,

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,590
so we noticed that the world has warmed
up about one and a half degrees

10
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:42,060
Fahrenheit in the last century.
With most of that warming in the last 30

11
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:47,061
years.
Well there's now 387 parts per million

12
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,870
of co two in the atmosphere.
I'm 150 years ago it was 280,

13
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,590
so it's increased by 107 ppm.
What we thought a few years ago was that

14
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,680
it would probably be safe to let CEO to
go as high as 450 parts per million.

15
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,450
The reason we thought that was that we
know that there were previous periods in

16
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:20,510
the earth's history called interglacial
periods.

17
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:25,510
We're now in a warm interglacial period,
which we have been in for about 12,000

18
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,510
years,
but there were prior periods when the

19
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:33,920
earth was warmer than it is now,
and the planet was still pretty much the

20
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:38,921
way it is now
and we thought that it was then about a

21
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,660
degree or so Celsius,
which is about two degrees Fahrenheit

22
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,430
warmer than it is now,
and we thought that might be okay to be

23
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:54,431
that warm and 450 parts per million
would probably take us to that sort of

24
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,550
climate,
but what we now realize is that during

25
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:03,350
those prior warm periods,
sea level was about six or seven meters

26
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:07,610
higher than it is now,
and also we see what's happening with

27
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:12,611
the current 387 parts per million.
That's already enough that the Arctic

28
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:16,820
sea ice is melting.
Mountain glaciers all around the world

29
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,190
are melting,
which is going to affect the fresh water

30
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:21,140
supply for billions of people.

31
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,160
The climate zones are shifting,
so the southwest United States and

32
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:30,170
Mediterranean region are becoming hotter
and drier.

33
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,670
Likewise,
Australia,

34
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:36,671
so you see increased forest fires and
reduced water supplies in those regions.

35
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,600
Coral reefs are already under stress.
They're going to.

36
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:45,830
Many of them are going to be lost if we
continue with increasing greenhouse

37
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:49,490
gases,
so we realize already the 387 is

38
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:54,491
actually two large,
about 350 parts per million is a more

39
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:59,621
realistic target and that means we're
going to have to phase out use of coal

40
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,620
over the next couple of decades.
If we want to be able to get back to 350

41
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:06,530
parts per million.

42
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,980
We simply,
if we look at the fossil fuels and we

43
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:17,360
see how much carbon there is an oil,
gas and coal,

44
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,890
and by far the largest is cold and we
know that we're going to use the oil and

45
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:23,210
the gas.
It's very.

46
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:27,470
They're very convenient fuels.
The big pools are owned by Russia and

47
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:30,410
Saudi Arabia.
There are certainly going to sell that

48
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:34,760
gas and oil.
If we want to be able to get back to 350

49
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:39,761
parts per million.
It's this huge coal reserves that we're

50
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:44,540
going to have to leave in the ground,
or we could burn the coal and capture

51
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,310
the co two and put it back in the
ground,

52
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:49,550
but that's very difficult.
We're going to have to move beyond

53
00:03:49,551 --> 00:03:53,390
fossil fuels sometime within the next
century anyway,

54
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,510
so why not do it now and preserve a
climate that will allow our children and

55
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:03,410
grandchildren to have the same sort of
planet that we enjoy and with all of the

56
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:05,300
species that are still on the planet.
