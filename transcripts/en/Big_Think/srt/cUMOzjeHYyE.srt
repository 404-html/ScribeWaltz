1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,180
Oh,
scientists and philosophers like to

2
00:00:03,181 --> 00:00:08,181
think that they're a very sober,
rational people who are

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,180
above the need to advertise,
and yet if you look closely,

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:20,181
you'll see that they often go to great
lengths to come up with a vivid,

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,120
memorable term,
a label for their theory or a or a name

6
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:30,390
for it that will stick in people's
heads.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,760
In other words,
they're trying to develop a brand name

8
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:35,280
or advertising or trademark for their
view,

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,670
and we should recognize that's a good
thing to do.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,260
If you're going to run an example or if
you're going to run an argument,

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,530
try to make it
as easy as possible for the audience or

12
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:51,620
the reader to,
uh,

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,740
keep track of the elements.
Don't call them a,

14
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:56,371
b,
c,

15
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:59,740
D and e called him bill and Arthur and
Freddy and,

16
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,050
and,
and so forth.

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,420
But of course that could backfire on
Youtube,

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,510
um,
or it can be misused.

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,080
Uh,
one of my favorite bad thought

20
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:14,640
experiments,
bad intuition pumps is one in a very

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,700
influential paper by green and Cohen
published in the proceedings of the

22
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,280
Royal Society on what neuroscience tells
us about freewill.

23
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,380
And this is the boys from Brazil and in
this thought experiment,

24
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,970
a were to imagine this,
it's inspired by the hokey science

25
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:41,700
fiction film,
the boys from Brazil about some evil

26
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:46,701
doctors who who clone Hitler and they're
trying to make Hitler clones and but in

27
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:52,281
in this telling,
they create a human being who has been

28
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:57,600
designed by their evil intentions to,
to live a life of crime,

29
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:01,560
to do evil things,
but just as rational as anybody else,

30
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:06,561
he's very much controlled the sort of a
sort of a designed psychopath and they

31
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:14,121
call him Mr. Puppet
and they described Mr. puppet and Mr.

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,120
puppet goes out and commits a crime and
they appeal to the readers.

33
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,370
That to conclude that
Mr. Papa doesn't really responsible for

34
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:28,680
his,
for his evil deeds.

35
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,670
He shouldn't be punished.
Certainly he's just the victim of his

36
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:37,671
circumstances and then a blessed the.
They say now Daniel Dennett Mike Object,

37
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,770
that this is just an intuition pump and
that we shouldn't take it seriously.

38
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,700
Yes.
It's not that it's an intuition pump.

39
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,160
Intuition pumps can be good.
It's a.

40
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,320
it's a bad intuition pump.
And they said they just having noticed,

41
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,560
having imagined that I might be critical
of their pump,

42
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:04,510
they go ahead and do it anyway.
So let me now turn the knobs on this

43
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:06,940
intuition pump and we'll see what we can
make of it.

44
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,580
First they say the fact that this,
this person was created by evil

45
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:16,450
scientists with evil intent,
that's irrelevant to the example.

46
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,440
Really.
So,

47
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:18,640
all right,
so let's get rid of them.

48
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:19,770
We'll turn that in the oven.

49
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,230
So,
and the indifferent environment produces

50
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,360
a human being who,
uh,

51
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,770
uh,
they'd say by design is set out on a

52
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,070
sort of antisocial trajectory.
Well,

53
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,050
but we can get rid of that by design
too,

54
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,900
because if it's an indifferent
environment,

55
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:41,890
then there's no intent on this.
So we now we've got this,

56
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:46,891
an indifferent environment happens to
produce an individual who with high

57
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:52,750
probability we'll engage in some
criminal activities,

58
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,850
let's say.
And then they imagined that,

59
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,520
that he killed somebody in a,
in a drug bust or something like,

60
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,400
you know,
in a drug deal gone bad.

61
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,740
Well,
that's an essential.

62
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:09,130
So we're going to change the crime,
we're going to make it.

63
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,130
Um,
he killed somebody who's witnessed some

64
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:16,570
embezzlement that he's done,
shouldn't make any difference.

65
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,780
If you thought that the Mr Puppet in the
first instance wasn't responsible and

66
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:24,320
shouldn't be held responsible and that
this shouldn't change it.

67
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,590
Now I want to change just one more
thing.

68
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,060
They keep talking about Mr. Puppet.
Okay.

69
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:34,360
That's a nice vivid name,
but it's just a name shouldn't make any

70
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,320
difference.
I'm going to change it.

71
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,010
Let's call Mr. Puppet.
Oh,

72
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,740
captain autonomy.
Okay.

73
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,980
So now captain autonomy is caused by an
indifferent environment to enter on a

74
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:54,820
trajectory where becomes likely that
he's going to commit some anti social

75
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:56,710
behavior.
And uh,

76
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,830
uh,
now the question is whether he should be

77
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:01,120
held responsible.
Well,

78
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:05,050
I think captain autonomy,
why shouldn't he be held responsible?

79
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,000
Let me flesh it out a little bit more.
Um,

80
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,880
let's suppose it captain autonomy is a
Harvard graduate,

81
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,560
uh,
who goes to work at Lehman brothers and

82
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,660
he sees a clever way of embezzling a few
million dollars and has pulled off his,

83
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,693
his,
uh,

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
white collar crime when he discovers a
person who has about to,

85
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,220
to,
uh,

86
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,723
expose him.

87
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,960
And He,
uh,

88
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,840
Louis him to the edge of the balcony and
the high rise and pushes him off and he

89
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,810
falls to his death.
Now that's my case.

90
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,470
Now,
are we so clear that captain autonomy is

91
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:49,960
a,
is not responsible for his deed?

92
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,680
It seems to me that I drained the
example of most of the ones that

93
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,620
provided the intuitions.
I'm not saying that my retelling of it

94
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,890
shows that he is responsible.
I'm just pointing out that those details

95
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:12,680
which presumably are ad Lib and you
shouldn't,

96
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:15,590
they shouldn't make a difference.
They make a huge difference into how we

97
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:19,810
think about this person and whether or
not to hold them responsible.
