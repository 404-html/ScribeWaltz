1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,390
I think one of the most memorable
moments was when I first saw her,

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,990
cause uh,
you know,

3
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:18,991
I had seen many pictures,
many videos of earth from space and

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,920
being able to see that with my own eyes
had a completely different effect and

5
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:28,921
sort of almost sensing life emanating
from our planet in the dark background

6
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:34,780
of the space.
It was a really memorable experience.

7
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,950
I wasn't frightened.
I've been living this in my head for

8
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:42,850
many,
many years.

9
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:43,930
So,
um,

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,870
I've sort of had played all these
scenarios,

11
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:51,871
have flying to spacing earth and I think
I was very prepared for it.

12
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:56,911
So it was almost a completely a joyful,
very happy,

13
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:02,950
very exciting experience.
And I didn't have time or you know,

14
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,370
any desire to think about what things
could go wrong.

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,410
Well,
I'm the first designer,

16
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,810
uh,
which is a design that won the Ansari x

17
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:19,890
prize that was designed by,
well Javier and space has been

18
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:22,180
commercialized by Virgin Galactic.
Uh,

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,980
right now I think their plans are for
the first commercial flights to take

20
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:29,100
place in 2012.
So it's not that far away.

21
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,240
And I think from there we will see a lot
more competition.

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,640
And I know many other companies are
building,

23
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,511
uh,
you know,

24
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:41,180
designing a new spacecraft for orbital
and snowboard resolve flights.

25
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,630
So as soon as we see competition and
we'll see the prices come down and

26
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:50,631
really an industry being created,
I think space travel is a dream for many

27
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:03,020
men and women.
Um,

28
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,730
I think it,
you know,

29
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:09,050
my trip will be perceived differently by
different genders because uh,

30
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,070
for women,
uh,

31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,960
a lot of time not only,
you know,

32
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:14,600
space travel,
it's not accessible to everyone,

33
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,280
but this even less accessible to women,
they're a lot more barriers for them,

34
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,630
especially if they live in countries
where things like space travel

35
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,700
engineering,
uh,

36
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,690
any science and technology related
fields would be considered a more male

37
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:34,310
dominated male appropriate field.
So I want to show them that there is

38
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:39,080
nothing preventing women or making them
less qualified to be involved in any of

39
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:40,580
these fields.
But the equally,

40
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:43,820
I think men also get very interested
because as I said,

41
00:02:43,821 --> 00:02:47,300
the space is not accessible today.
Too many people.

42
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:51,050
And one of my goals as my involvement
through and sorry,

43
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:54,740
x prize was to create the opportunity
for everyone equally,

44
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,574
men and women.

45
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,930
I say that a woman's right is definitely
a key issue because you also see a woman

46
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:09,040
actually in a way being very,
very active in this movement.

47
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,870
Um,
it has been an issue,

48
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,550
um,
you know,

49
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:14,140
over the past,
uh,

50
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,150
you know,
years and,

51
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,520
uh,
the situation sort of fluctuates.

52
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:22,060
Sometimes it's um,
gets a little bit easier and it gets

53
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:23,820
harder again.
And uh,

54
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,480
overall I think,
uh,

55
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:30,481
women in Iran are very resilient and I'm
very proud of all the Iranian woman that

56
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:33,850
are sending up for the rights and
speaking out.

57
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,730
And,
uh,

58
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,160
I hope that they will succeed and I'm
glad that the international community is

59
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:41,170
paying attention and supporting them as
well.

60
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,880
At Protea.
Uh,

61
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,900
what do you want it to do is build a
platform to be able to deliver Internet

62
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:54,800
based application to the users,
um,

63
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,790
in sort of a mass market environment
regardless of their skill sets or where

64
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,310
they live.
And you want it to do that so they can

65
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:06,750
consume the information or the
experience or the application to any

66
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:09,780
media,
that medium that they are used to using,

67
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:14,781
whether it's a mobile or the TV or their
pc or any other devices that could be

68
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:19,821
created in a ubiquitous manner and
making information and services,

69
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,790
uh,
ubiquitously and simply available to

70
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:28,791
everyone will actually close the digital
gap that exists today between

71
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:33,840
generations sometimes and create new
opportunities actually for current

72
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:38,841
application service providers to address
a bit much larger market place and be

73
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:42,960
able to design applications that are
more suited for this larger audience.
