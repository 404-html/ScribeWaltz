1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,860
I'm Peter,
I'm founder and CEO of line too.

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,650
That's a great question.
I think the first thing is don't quit

3
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:19,640
your day job until you've done real
diligence on the idea.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,030
And what I mean by that is,
is really look at the market,

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,940
look at where the market is headed,
look at the trends,

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,220
look at the competitive landscape and,
and try to play a few strategic moves

7
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:36,050
into the future to see is this something
that's ultimately going to be dominated

8
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:40,460
by x big company or why big company.
That's not always a reason to say no,

9
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:42,620
but it's certainly something you want to
look at.

10
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,230
And then,
um,

11
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,150
and then make sure you have a business
model and you know,

12
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:49,260
how you're gonna make money and then,
you know,

13
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,990
bounce it off.
A few smart people,

14
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:52,920
but not too many.
Um,

15
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,460
people you really trust.
But we'll be honest with you.

16
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,910
And if it passes all of those tests,
then you should ignore everyone else

17
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:06,761
that tells you it's a bad idea because
you will hear endlessly from people that

18
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:11,270
are naysayers or don't understand it and
haven't researched as well as you have

19
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,010
at that point.
Who will say,

20
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:14,210
no,
that's not possible.

21
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:17,870
And here's why,
and I'm part of being an entrepreneur is

22
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:21,440
that as long as you've done that initial
diligence and you've convinced a few

23
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:26,030
smart people and you all agree that this
is an opportunity,

24
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,380
then you've got to just believe that to
the very end and,

25
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,190
and,
uh,

26
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,690
because you will get a lot of days where
you start to second guess yourself and

27
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:36,524
where,
uh,

28
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,260
people are telling you that is not a
good idea.

29
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,250
Now I'll qualify that with,
um,

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,220
the key to startup success and why they
succeed,

31
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:50,750
where big companies don't,
is that they can turn on a dime and the

32
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:54,530
whole process of a,
I can take you through how we started

33
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,270
lying to slash talk to me.

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,150
But the whole process is,
um,

35
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,490
it's really about test and measure,
test and measure in a sense.

36
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,060
I mean,
yes,

37
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,540
we all hear about um,
you know,

38
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:12,170
there's the facebooks of the world and
there's the googles and they're these

39
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:15,350
massive home runs and,
and everyone sort of thinks that,

40
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,840
you know,
I just put up a website and if I get

41
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:20,570
lucky and do the right things,
it's going to take off,

42
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:24,170
but very few businesses are created that
way and that's,

43
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:24,890
it's,
it's,

44
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,420
it's sort of like in the movie business,
there's only you can count the major

45
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:31,100
stars on,
on,

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,400
on two hands and everybody else's
working their ass off.

47
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,330
And not that they don't work either,
but it's a little easier for him maybe.

48
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,480
Um,
and so the trick is you don't have to

49
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:43,910
risk a lot of capital upfront to learn
things.

50
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:48,380
So the way we do it is,
and you don't have to get it right,

51
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,970
but you get it out.

52
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,490
There is the trick.
Get something out there.

53
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,020
If you sit and stew and try to make it
perfect and nothing ever gets out there,

54
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,010
you can be too cautious.
So the trick is get it out there and

55
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:02,470
then iterate,
get feedback from customers.

56
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,100
And that's what we've been doing.
We got the first version of our product

57
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:10,210
out in February of 2008.
And um,

58
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,950
we,
we did,

59
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,290
didn't do much to promote it.
We just,

60
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,920
we got 50,
70 Beta customers and then we iterated

61
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:19,870
on what they were telling us,
what they like about it,

62
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:21,850
what didn't they like about it,
what features are missing,

63
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:25,330
what do they want to see?
And we iterated for nine months until we

64
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:29,410
were comfortable to actually start to
put marketing money behind it.

65
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,720
And um,
and there's a lot of learning that,

66
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,370
that,
that,

67
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,120
that is you have to be receptive to.
So,

68
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,440
um,
it's,

69
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,830
it isn't really sort of this,
you know,

70
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,630
put it out there,
build the field,

71
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:47,470
and they will come,
which is really has a whole other aspect

72
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:49,030
too is once you've got the product
right,

73
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,880
the real challenge is attracting
customers to it.

74
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:54,460
It can be a fantastic,
insanely great product,

75
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,910
but if you can't get the word out and
acquire customers cost effectively so

76
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:02,080
that you have a business model and can
make money.

77
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,810
It doesn't matter how nice a product it
is.

78
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,060
I have always wanted to start a
business.

79
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:14,950
I've always felt that a running my own
company was really the best place for

80
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:17,260
me,
the best home for me for a lot of

81
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:19,290
reasons which we can go into.
Um,

82
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,780
and um,
typically I'd look at different

83
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:25,210
opportunities and see what,
uh,

84
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,750
you know,
could pan out and the trick is to be

85
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:32,800
very hard on yourself when you're first
thinking of an idea and talk to smart

86
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,300
people to make sure that,
um,

87
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,910
you kind of vet it out.
Um,

88
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,610
and then the first one was,
um,

89
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,770
typically you want to solve a problem.
Right?

90
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,810
And the problem I had was that I liked
wine,

91
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,350
but I would go into a wine store and I
had no idea which one was good in which

92
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:52,450
was in,
which is still a problem today.

93
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,060
So you could rewind spectator,
other,

94
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,900
other,
uh,

95
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,550
magazines to learn about wine.

96
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,430
Um,
but then you could never find the wines

97
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:03,850
that they were talking about.
And so there was a mismatch between the

98
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:08,851
ability to learn about a wine and then
act on that information to make a

99
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:12,280
purchase.
And Wine Shopper was my first company,

100
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:16,930
which was a site that combined the
ability to buy wine with the,

101
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,090
uh,
information,

102
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,250
um,
including ratings from wine spectator

103
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:25,480
and wine enthusiast and other agencies,
reviews community and all of this.

104
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:29,820
And this was 1999.
It was a bubble company.

105
00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:31,900
I,
it was funded by Kleiner Perkins and

106
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:36,901
Amazon Dot com raise $46,000,000 and
built a 200 employee company very

107
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:41,970
quickly.
And uh,

108
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,600
ultimately,
um,

109
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:48,520
learned some painful lessons in terms of
access to capital and how quickly that

110
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:50,080
can dry up.
Um,

111
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:52,540
the company was ultimately acquired by a
competitor,

112
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,040
um,
and uh,

113
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,340
but that competitor did not survive.
So that my first sort of big venture

114
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,430
kind of deal,
good experience,

115
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:04,670
lots of learning,
but nobody made any money on x one

116
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:07,090
called Masonic was,
uh,

117
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,720
uh,
I started,

118
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,330
you know,
I was pretty upset for a little while

119
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:13,460
and then I realized that,
you know,

120
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,370
um,
you've just got to pick yourself up and

121
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:17,240
dust yourself off.

122
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,700
And that's entrepreneurship is really
like sales and that,

123
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,033
you know,
it can,

124
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,100
you get a lot of discouragement along
the way and you have to be really strong

125
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:30,110
and just keep going.
So I just got right back up on the

126
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:32,610
horse,
started a company called [inaudible],

127
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,450
which is now profitable and growing
nicely,

128
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,010
still private.
I'm on the board,

129
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,070
so that one's a wait and see,
I'd say,

130
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,790
um,
uh,

131
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,770
then I started a company called Taleo,
which was a,

132
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,070
um,
a white label version of skype if you

133
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:51,410
know what skype is,
I think most people do by now.

134
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,400
And um,
that was very lucky timing and was

135
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:57,580
acquired by Microsoft,
um,

136
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,490
within 18 months of its being founded.
And um,

137
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,760
I didn't want to work for Microsoft,
so I signed a noncompete,

138
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,030
uh,
took a year off and traveled and then

139
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,710
started my latest venture line to also
known as talked to me.

140
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,610
Um,
but I'm line to is really a,

141
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,270
a,
um,

142
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:24,070
solution for where business is headed
today in terms of the way people work.

143
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,080
If you think about,
um,

144
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,800
landlines,
you know,

145
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,420
more and more people are saying,
why do I need a landline?

146
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,320
And they're getting rid of them and
they're sticking to their mobile phone

147
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,540
and there's some problems with that
because it doesn't always work in your

148
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,550
home and there's battery life issues and
stuff,

149
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:42,920
but a lot of people getting rid of
landlines,

150
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,160
we believe,
um,

151
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,910
with line two,
the same thing is happening in the

152
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,220
office environment,
particularly small businesses.

153
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,910
You don't really need an office where
everyone has to drive their car in and

154
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:56,780
park in order to be productive anymore.
You have all of this technology that you

155
00:07:56,781 --> 00:08:01,340
can use the Internet and communication
technologies to be productive virtually.

156
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,430
So lying to basically a is a business
line on your mobile phone.

157
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:11,270
It's a second line so you add a second
line to your mobile phone.

158
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:15,530
That's why it's called line to that has
all the features ultimately that that

159
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,060
office phone had no transferring calls,
setting up conferences and stuff like

160
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:20,780
that.

161
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,200
And so we've just released it.
It was approved by Apple,

162
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,850
um,
in early September.

163
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,190
And sales have been very strong.
I think there's a lot of need for that

164
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,280
and ultimately the problem we're solving
is that people want to work and be

165
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:39,020
productive,
but they don't want or need an office

166
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:40,940
and they don't want to be tethered.
There's no,

167
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,751
I mean,
people don't,

168
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,730
even,
everyone's using Wifi.

169
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,680
There is,
there's not even a jack in,

170
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:49,640
into which a plug and office phone in
most office environments for new

171
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:51,680
companies.
So that's what we do.

172
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,800
So long answer to your question,
to sort of give you a,

173
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,890
of each business,
it's always about trying to solve a

174
00:08:58,891 --> 00:08:59,724
problem.

175
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,200
Very important.
Um,

176
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,180
we,
I was skeptical at first and uh,

177
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,300
I still scratch my head about twitter,
but I now uh,

178
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,740
uh,
uh,

179
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:12,600
I mean,
I,

180
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,800
it's,
it's here to stay,

181
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,350
you know,
it's one of those things that it's a

182
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:18,930
self fulfilling.
It became popular because it became

183
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:20,100
popular.
I don't know how to describe it,

184
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,383
but,
um,

185
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,890
uh,
at any rate,

186
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,150
we,
I,

187
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,920
the guy that does my marketing is
religious about that.

188
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:31,240
So for example,
uh,

189
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,420
there's a lot of cool tricks.
So we,

190
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,810
one thing,
there's a lot of stuff that,

191
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,120
um,
that's important.

192
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,470
And one of them is you need to blog.
And I was like,

193
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:45,230
why do I need a blog?
Part of it is,

194
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,360
is if you have constantly changing
content on your website,

195
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:53,160
so the blog has to be on your website.
Then a search engines reward that.

196
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,650
So like a new site or sun,
constantly changing content.

197
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,650
So if you put up a website and do
nothing with it,

198
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:01,440
you'll slip down.
If you keep changing the content and

199
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:05,490
making that content relevant to the
service that you offer and the types of

200
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:08,280
customers you're trying to attract,
you'll start to go up and natural

201
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:10,080
search.
The other thing that you do is,

202
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:12,960
and once you blog a post,
this is where the social media comes in,

203
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:19,290
post a blog entry,
then you tweet it and you post it to

204
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,390
Linkedin,
facebook,

205
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:22,740
everywhere,
um,

206
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,470
and two different groups.
And,

207
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,270
and,
and then what happens is this magic

208
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:30,780
thing happens where it just gets,
it reverberates through the web.

209
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:35,340
It's really fascinating.
And so one blog post suddenly translates

210
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:40,341
into multiple hits and those hits are
all then linking back to your blog post.

211
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,260
And that means you're getting more links
into your website,

212
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,540
which as you probably know in search
engine optimization,

213
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,510
that's another thing that's very
important is to generate links back to

214
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:50,070
your site.
So,

215
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,320
um,
I was sort of dragged kicking and

216
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:54,450
screaming.
But now I'm a true believer.

217
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,800
It really does work.

218
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,710
There's a lot of companies offering
phone service obviously.

219
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,780
Um,
and uh,

220
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,670
you know,
we are,

221
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,380
our differentiation is our focus and I
think this is important important lesson

222
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:12,720
for all startups is that,
um,

223
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,720
we,
we have a lot of people because we only

224
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:20,721
charged 1490 $5 a month who ask us if
they can hook up a Ata,

225
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,640
which is what vonage provides it,
which is a little box that you plug your

226
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,200
phone into.
One end is the internet.

227
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:27,720
The other end is the phone.
They want an Ata.

228
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,320
But I know from looking at vonage and
other companies that the biggest support

229
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:38,250
expense for those companies is that Ata,
because getting people to get under

230
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:41,220
their desks and play with their routers
and hook that thing up,

231
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,720
it's a pain and everyone practically
needs a customer support person holding

232
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:47,460
their hand through the process.
So it's very expensive.

233
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,670
And um,
so we're like,

234
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,800
yes,
our customers,

235
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,540
there are customers that are trying to
drag us in that direction,

236
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:01,050
but we are razor focused on our belief
that the future is not about wired

237
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:04,390
phones,
that the future is about mobile and

238
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,390
laptop calling.
So it's like skype and your mobile

239
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:09,970
phone.
So what does business phone service look

240
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:14,350
like in a world of skype and mobile
phones and that's what we're laser

241
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:16,870
focused on and we're the only ones
positioned that way.

242
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,540
And by being that focused,
um,

243
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,430
it just makes everything better.
One,

244
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:25,450
you can communicate your position to the
market in a much more laser focused way

245
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:29,290
so that you can actually stand out as a
brand.

246
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,480
That's an interesting question because,
um,

247
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,180
we are increasingly getting consumers
who come to us and um,

248
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,760
so the line to app as I talked about
earlier,

249
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,580
particularly young people that are like
a landline,

250
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:46,660
why,
you know,

251
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:51,661
why does it make sense for me to buy a
phone wire to a wall in particularly

252
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:55,780
young people because they're moving from
dorms and apartments and many

253
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:58,630
apartments.
It just makes no sense and you can't

254
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:00,480
even,
uh,

255
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,150
use it most of the time because you're,
you're out and about and what have you.

256
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,470
So what's the point?
So,

257
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,140
um,
people want to get rid of their

258
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:10,720
landline.
The problem is some can't because either

259
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:12,760
they don't have cell phone reception at
home,

260
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,590
um,
or you know,

261
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:16,810
they talk a lot and they don't want to
wear down the battery though,

262
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,190
you know,
there's all sorts of reasons.

263
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,860
And so,
um,

264
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,650
you can use line to the current version
works over cellular,

265
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:26,470
but the version coming out in a couple
months,

266
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,360
we'll work over cellular or over Wifi
and that's going to be the first dual

267
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:35,260
mode thing on your iphone,
on the smartphone,

268
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:35,830
on the market.

269
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,540
So in the US,
so like skype can only work over Wifi,

270
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:44,541
it can go over broadband.
So bottom line is a,

271
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,420
excuse me,
you can't go over cellular.

272
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:50,920
Skype only works over a wide,
so on the iphone.

273
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,880
So if you can,
this now gives you way to ditch your

274
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:57,520
landline.
So long answer to your question,

275
00:13:57,521 --> 00:14:02,521
but you could use a line to number as
your landline substitute.

276
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,010
You can use it over Wifi when you're at
home and you don't have cell phone

277
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,470
reception,
you can use it as sort of the number you

278
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:10,800
give out to everybody else,
not the number.

279
00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:12,760
You're best friends have your cell phone
number,

280
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,510
but you know your bank people and credit
card companies statement.

281
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,660
You know anyone billing anyone where
they asked for your home phone number

282
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,770
that you're doing business with or or
something and you don't want to be

283
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:24,760
bothered on your cell phone.

284
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,660
You do that on your line to number and
then you have all these controls where

285
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:30,670
you can say,
let certain people through,

286
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:32,950
depending on the time of day,
who they are,

287
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:34,630
whether they're friend,
whether business,

288
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:36,460
different greetings,
depending on who they are.

289
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,890
Um,
you can do all this stuff to sort of

290
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,180
make it a much more of a tool rather
than a nuisance.

291
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:45,610
Which I think Mike,
my landline phone at home,

292
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:47,350
I never answered anymore because it's
all spam.

293
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,810
It's,
it's even though I'm on the do not call

294
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:52,610
lists and have been since I started it.
People,

295
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:55,670
I don't know where they get my number,
but every call I get is some kind of

296
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:57,500
marketing call.
So it's,

297
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,463
it's useless.

298
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,880
I mean constant.
That's how you learn.

299
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:07,730
Right?
And what's nice about silicon valley is

300
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:09,560
that it rewards that.
Well,

301
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:10,610
no,
let me take that back.

302
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,160
Um,
it doesn't reward that it tolerate it

303
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:18,220
more than I'm a large enterprise where
mistakes can be career ending in an,

304
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,780
a really bad company where they,
you know,

305
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,110
where it's a fear,
typically a,

306
00:15:26,111 --> 00:15:31,111
a corporation that's run on fear versus
encouragement and sticks rather than

307
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:37,001
carrots tends to be an environment where
mistakes are not tolerated and then no

308
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:40,730
innovation happens.
And so silicon valley's the opposite.

309
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,090
It,
it encourage you to take risks and,

310
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:47,180
you know,
entrepreneurs are not rational business

311
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:48,530
people.
I mean,

312
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:53,360
if you look at the risk and reward
curves,

313
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,280
we're way out here.
We're taking a lot of risk for,

314
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:59,570
in the hopes of a lot of reward,
but it's not really rational.

315
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,590
You actually,
most business people are much closer to

316
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:04,790
the,
uh,

317
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,800
the origin there where there's some risk
and some reward but not the kind of

318
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:10,940
risks that entrepreneurs take.

319
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,070
So,
um,

320
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,240
you know,
the mistakes I've made in taking those

321
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,550
risks have been numerous.
And,

322
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:18,130
uh,
you know,

323
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,200
there are wine shop or obviously we were
burning $3,000,000 a month and before we

324
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:27,320
even had customers.
And that was,

325
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,120
you know,
the dog food that everybody's eating

326
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,400
back in or the Koolaid that everybody
was drinking was,

327
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,720
you know,
build these,

328
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,240
build it.
It's a land grab and the eye.

329
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:37,400
Everyone believed that it was,
the Internet was a land grabbing.

330
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,120
You had to build this thing.
We built a 20,000 orders at a pick pack

331
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:45,950
center to automatically fulfill wine.
And it was a thing of beauty.

332
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,520
I'm built it from Greenfield to pull
production in six months.

333
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,850
Had 15 bays for big ups trucks to back
up into and you know,

334
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:59,330
it never got to ship much wine.
And um,

335
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,860
you know,
it did actually,

336
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:03,530
uh,
those assets were restarted by Kleiner

337
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:07,340
and a new company called new vine
logistics which did ship line in the

338
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:09,260
back end for winery clubs and what have
you.

339
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,510
But it was never,
never the,

340
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:14,660
the opportunity that we all believed it
would be.

341
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,320
Um,
and you know,

342
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,240
other mistakes.
I mean,

343
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:19,060
you make hiring mistakes,
you make,

344
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:22,070
um,
a strategic mistakes.

345
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:26,330
You had an opportunity to merge with a
company earlier in wine,

346
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,060
a wine shoppers history that I did
pursue.

347
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,040
Hindsight is 20 slash 20,
I should have pursued it.

348
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,020
Um,
but you know,

349
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:38,021
each time you get smarter and um,
the other thing you learn to do is you

350
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:41,810
don't fret over your mistakes,
you just interest instantly correct and

351
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,400
move on.
You make a bad hire,

352
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,360
you gotta make the decision to say,
listen,

353
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:50,580
this isn't right.
It's not working out and you cut and run

354
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:52,260
and you and hire someone else.
So,

355
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,750
you know,
as long as you can act decisively,

356
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,330
you can,
um,

357
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,820
uh,
undo the effects of bad decisions.

358
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:02,450
But I think we all make that decisions.
Um,

359
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,210
the fact is,
if you never made any bad decisions,

360
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,010
you probably weren't taking any risks.

361
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,480
Yeah,
fundraising is hard right now.

362
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,540
I'm a angels have their personal net
worth have been depleted in some cases

363
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:22,650
not depleted,
but certainly reduced where they're less

364
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:24,490
willing to take risks.
Um,

365
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,230
the vcs,
some vcs have had trouble closing new

366
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:29,130
funds.
I mean,

367
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:34,080
the top vcs have money to spend and
there's plenty of money that's being

368
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:35,960
spent and invested.
Um,

369
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,510
the way I think of it is,
um,

370
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,980
well in terms of the stages,
it will almost always is going to be

371
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:46,080
credit card debt and friends and family
initially.

372
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,170
Um,
it's very rare that you're going to go

373
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:53,640
right out of whatever your ideas pop
into Kleiner Perkins and they're going

374
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:56,580
to write you a check.
You're going to have to prove something

375
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:01,730
before you can typically raise money
from a vc and the four areas that you,

376
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,450
they look at,
there's four areas of risk and,

377
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,330
and investing is all about risk versus
reward.

378
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,030
So they want as least as little risk for
the most reward.

379
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:13,500
So they're going to try and reduce that
risk.

380
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:15,360
So there's management,
risk,

381
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,550
market risk,
financial risk,

382
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:20,910
and technology risk.
So Management Risk,

383
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,530
if you've never run a company before,
you'll do much better going into pitch a

384
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,170
VC.
If you've already got two or three

385
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,080
seasoned people who have run the types
of functions,

386
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:34,330
you need them to run and done it
successfully on your team.

387
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:38,520
So that reduces management risk.
People in the company who've done it

388
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:39,870
before,
um,

389
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,300
you don't have to do all four of these,
but you have to hit to,

390
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,360
you know,
typically hit depending on the investing

391
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:49,740
climate to two to four.
So market risk is,

392
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,790
is there a market for your product?
What's the competitive landscape?

393
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,653
Is it,
you know,

394
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,960
a billion dollar opportunity because vcs
typically they want to see at least a

395
00:19:57,961 --> 00:19:59,340
billion dollar addressable market.

396
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,260
That doesn't mean you can't start a
company.

397
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,830
Um,
uh,

398
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,730
if it doesn't have an addressable market
of a billion dollars,

399
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:07,830
it just means it's probably not a vc
play.

400
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,240
It's probably a different type of
business and you don't have to attract

401
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,110
venture to build a great business.
As many people know.

402
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,380
I'm the third one was financial risk,
which is,

403
00:20:19,381 --> 00:20:22,020
is there a business model?
Can you actually make money,

404
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,620
you know,
is there a way for this business to

405
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:29,550
sustain itself and be profitable?
And the fourth is technology risk,

406
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:31,520
which if your,
um,

407
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,910
company involves some kind of new
technology or new thing,

408
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,240
have you built one and proven that it
can be done.

409
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,650
And,
you know,

410
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:42,590
during the bubble days,
like in,

411
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,780
in 1998,
99 when it was really crazy,

412
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:51,070
you could probably only have to tick off
one of those boxes to get vc funding.

413
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,100
I'm now,
uh,

414
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:58,330
you probably need to tick off pretty
probably all four,

415
00:20:58,331 --> 00:21:00,070
maybe three.
And you know,

416
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:04,360
and market and mitigating market risk
means having paying customers,

417
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:06,460
right?
So that's not always the case.

418
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:10,780
Certainly in the past few years there's
been a rush of money sent into social

419
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:12,610
media stuff.
But,

420
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:14,300
um,
uh,

421
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,010
you know,
the more that you can sort of address

422
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:23,011
those four issues and do it in a very
convincing way through data,

423
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,820
through,
you know,

424
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,290
um,
Beta customers through a letters of

425
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,110
intent,
whatever you can do to sort of increase

426
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:36,010
the likelihood that you're going to be
able to execute is going to improve your

427
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:36,970
chances of getting funded.

428
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,000
It's very hard.
Hiring is the most important job of the

429
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,700
CEO.
And it's the hardest in many ways

430
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,240
because if you think about it,
first of all,

431
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,250
the screening process is broken,
right?

432
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:54,400
And you get an email on a resume and
you're supposed to figure out who this

433
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:57,940
person is.
So clearly the screening process means

434
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,310
you're leaving some good people behind
and,

435
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,140
and not so,
you know,

436
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:04,750
obviously that's the whole purpose of
using your network.

437
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:09,700
If you can find someone who you are
somehow connected with that sort of is

438
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:12,130
the prescreening process either through
someone.

439
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,390
So that helps with the screening.
Um,

440
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,803
you know,
I,

441
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,500
different people look for different
things.

442
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:18,250
I've,
I've,

443
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,970
you know,
part of the reason I'm an entrepreneurs

444
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:24,280
that um,
I am not a political animal.

445
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:29,230
I don't think I could ever succeed quite
frankly in a big enterprise where,

446
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,500
in my opinion,
and this may be unfair to people in big

447
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:36,160
enterprises where half the battle of
getting ahead is playing the political

448
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:37,060
game correctly.

449
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:42,250
It's not purely about the best ideas.
And I'm in a startup environment,

450
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,900
you get a chance to see your ideas tried
very quickly and it's not about who you

451
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:49,600
play golf with.
And so when I'm hiring,

452
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:54,601
I try to look for people who have
succeeded environments where politics

453
00:22:55,511 --> 00:23:00,250
probably wasn't part of their success.
And there's ways to read that.

454
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:04,510
You can read it and body language and
answers to certain questions.

455
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,840
Um,
but I really try to wean out the

456
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:12,841
political animals and focus on people
who are really good,

457
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:19,230
not just really politically savvy.
And the other thing I do is I,

458
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
um,
you know,

459
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:25,930
I think it's very important to ask them
some questions that,

460
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,810
uh,
are more on the human side,

461
00:23:28,811 --> 00:23:32,320
not just the work,
the work stuff is a given.

462
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:35,170
Do they have the skills,
you're going to get that out of the way

463
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:36,010
pretty quickly.

464
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,020
But then you've got a sort of,
is this someone I want to work with is

465
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,010
as someone I can trust,
is this someone who's a team player?

466
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,920
And one of the things I did with my
first company actually would,

467
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:50,020
would wine shop or was
I the condition of being hired was that

468
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,440
everyone was gonna make the same base
salary and it was going to be low.

469
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,640
And you know,
this is when,

470
00:23:57,641 --> 00:23:59,750
you know,
with Kleiner Perkins and Amazon backing

471
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:01,220
us,
there are a lot of people who were

472
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:03,110
coming to us with dollar signs in their
eyes.

473
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,180
And I said,
I want to weed out the people that are

474
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:06,980
really passionate about this
opportunity,

475
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,060
so I'm going to only offer for these
art.

476
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:11,900
And these were people from becoming
seasoned people.

477
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,410
I'm going to only offer $130,000 in
salary.

478
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:19,640
I'll take that salary and everyone will
get the same salary and for the first

479
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:23,540
year everyone's going to get the same
salary and that after that there'll be

480
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:24,440
more merit based.

481
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,350
And,
and that was really effective at

482
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,390
building a cohesive team because one,
people who were in it just for the

483
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:34,340
money,
that was a turnoff for them and they

484
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:36,350
were out the door,
they never even applied.

485
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:41,630
And then
everyone felt like there's this whole

486
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:45,290
sort of survey or salary envy thing that
can happen in a management team.

487
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:48,710
Like how come that person getting paid
more than if everyone knows that

488
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:52,190
everybody's paid the same.
Then it sort of breaks down that one

489
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,870
potential for,
um,

490
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,800
a tension in the office.
And it worked right?

491
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,220
Rebuilt at a wine shop or it was
probably the best management team I've

492
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:02,140
ever built.
I mean,

493
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:06,950
it really was an excellent team and um,
so it,

494
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,750
it,
it's a tough process though and um,

495
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,290
you do have to move quickly when you
make mistake.

496
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,590
Yeah.
I think,

497
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,920
um,
where it has mostly been in the

498
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:22,730
opportunity with to bond with people in
the industry.

499
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,850
Certainly in the bay area where I
started most of my businesses,

500
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,330
it's really a nonissue and in fact it
can even be a plus because there's so

501
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:35,570
much networking within the gay world
there.

502
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,830
But I'm like,
there was an instance where,

503
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,260
um,
a couple,

504
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,950
you know,
a guy who was very senior at facebook

505
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:51,020
and is moved on to an even bigger role
elsewhere as a guy.

506
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:53,000
Really good guy to know.
Very smart guy.

507
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:56,420
I've known him for 10 years and um,
you know,

508
00:25:56,421 --> 00:26:01,310
he and another guy I know and,
and I went on kind of the stag trip to

509
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,470
Las Vegas and,
and,

510
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:04,460
um,
I didn't,

511
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,880
I wasn't invited and didn't know about
it and found out afterwards and it was

512
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:08,714
fine,
but,

513
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,620
you know,
I think they wouldn't have felt

514
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:16,490
comfortable with me being there because
it was kind of a stag male bonding thing

515
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,740
and um,
and I probably wouldn't have been

516
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:20,330
comfortable in it.

517
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,310
The other thing that happens is
increasingly I've chosen not to have

518
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:27,170
kids.
I realize you can have kids as a,

519
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,710
as a gay adult,
but I've chosen not to and I'm

520
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,570
increasingly people's lives centered
around their families and social

521
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,620
calendars.
So there's,

522
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:41,650
I think there's just stuff that maybe
I'm not as connected with people because

523
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,720
I don't up play dates with their kids
and my kids and all that kind of stuff.

524
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,470
So there's some social aspects maybe
that I missed out on,

525
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:54,471
but there's never been any sort of
problem with anyone finding out that I

526
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:59,970
was gay and suddenly not wanting to do
business with me or not wanting to fund

527
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:01,260
me or,
you know,

528
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:03,420
in fact,
typically what happens because I was

529
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:06,750
afraid to tell people,
but when I finally told people that have

530
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:09,780
wine shop or um,
the management team,

531
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,130
it was amazing.

532
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,250
It really was amazing and I was in a
fraternity in college and,

533
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,620
you know,
have learned how to sort of fit into a

534
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:23,190
very male dominant dominated environment
and was just fine at it.

535
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,920
Um,
so I tend to just slip into that.

536
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,851
But,
you know,

537
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:30,630
what I don't do anymore is I don't feign
interest in sports because I'm simply

538
00:27:30,631 --> 00:27:33,630
not.
And I don't feign interest in girls

539
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:35,400
because I'm simply not.
Um,

540
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,610
and so whereas up until maybe even 10
years ago,

541
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:40,440
I would sort of,
you know,

542
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,740
jump in on those conversations and it
just felt so wrong.

543
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,650
Right?
So I think that was,

544
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,370
that's the only issues is maybe just
missing out on some bonding

545
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:55,320
opportunities with people that are
straight oriented,

546
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:57,480
like family stuff and stuff.
But other than that,

547
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,220
I'm not really an issue.

548
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,230
You know,
I thought I looked at that question and

549
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,780
um,
you know,

550
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:10,770
I,
my favorite business icon is steve jobs

551
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:13,390
in terms of my role model.
Um,

552
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,720
and he's not gay,
but,

553
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:16,770
um,
I couldn't,

554
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:20,880
I couldn't think of anyone in the
business world that I knew was gay and

555
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:25,230
that I think is telling right because
I'm sure that some of these very

556
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:27,510
successful business people that are out
there are gay,

557
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,230
but they're not out.
And so that's why it's difficult to

558
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:34,170
answer that question.
I'm in the business world because,

559
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,550
you know,
I know I'm

560
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,600
confidentially,
so I won't say.

561
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:44,370
But I can think of five major household
name companies where I know either the

562
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:48,720
CEO or very senior people who are gay
and um,

563
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,380
but they're very careful about it.
And so,

564
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,270
uh,
you know,

565
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:59,220
I think the business world is kind of
the last frontier I think for,

566
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,960
um,
uh,

567
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,240
that kind of diversity to really take
hold.

568
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,790
Um,
and it's,

569
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,790
it's a,
um,

570
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,160
I don't know,
it's,

571
00:29:10,161 --> 00:29:11,880
it's interesting.
It also is very regional.

572
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,910
I think if you're in,
it's big difference if you're trying to

573
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:19,911
do business in perhaps a more
conservative part of the country than it

574
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:22,890
would be if you're doing business in San
Francisco in New York.

575
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:25,870
We're really,
it is completely anon issue.

576
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,450
It's just a relevant.

577
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,960
Yeah,
there are issues.

578
00:29:30,961 --> 00:29:32,210
I mean,
certainly,

579
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,600
um,
I think in the,

580
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:36,360
in the Arab world for example,
I think it'd be very challenging.

581
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,640
Um,
and uh,

582
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:42,100
China,
I don't know as much about views on

583
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,980
homosexuality,
but I imagine not great.

584
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,720
Um,
you know,

585
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,840
the bottom line is that business,
unless you're in the sex business,

586
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,440
there is no reason to mix sex and
business and I'm just like in the

587
00:29:58,511 --> 00:30:01,600
straight world,
it would be inappropriate in a meeting

588
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:04,960
to discuss your fetishes or,
or something like that.

589
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,290
Uh,
and,

590
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,760
and you know,
your wife and all,

591
00:30:09,761 --> 00:30:13,160
you just don't talk about it.
And so it,

592
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,830
it really doesn't need to be relevant
and it doesn't need to be discussed.

593
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,870
And it would be weird.
I actually,

594
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,320
um,
I've always been of the belief that I

595
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:28,321
should just be myself and um,
if someone asks me,

596
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,941
are you gay,
I'll,

597
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:33,030
I will answer them honestly,
but I'm not going to broadcast that

598
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,880
necessarily.

599
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,380
Um,
because it's,

600
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,030
uh,
it's,

601
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,400
it's a personal characteristic of me.
Um,

602
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,480
I was made this way and it's nothing
that everybody I need to rub in

603
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:47,470
everybody's face.
I mean,

604
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,300
it's just a,
it's an,

605
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,360
it's an aspect of me.
I have no problems with it.

606
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,750
I'm proud of myself,
but it isn't something I need to wear on

607
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:59,920
my sleeve.
And so I just can't think of,

608
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:04,240
you know,
in 20 years of doing business in some

609
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:07,480
form,
I can't think of any situation where

610
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,750
it's ever come up in any kind of meeting
with,

611
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,600
you know,
big companies,

612
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,660
Sony,
Dell,

613
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:16,270
staples,
all sorts of big corporations.

614
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:18,880
I've met with a New York Times,
you know,

615
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,860
and it just never comes up,
which is great.

616
00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:21,910
Yeah.
