1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,410
The more comfortable I get as a
performer over years and years and years

2
00:00:09,411 --> 00:00:12,350
of practicing and performing over and
over again for lots of different

3
00:00:12,351 --> 00:00:17,000
audiences,
the more present I am able to be in the

4
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:19,910
room.
So instead of losing myself in

5
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:24,911
performance,
I actually find my exact location in a

6
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:30,410
very
visceral way.

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,050
So I become increasingly aware of
everybody in the audience and what

8
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:38,930
they're doing.
I know who is falling asleep.

9
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:41,450
I know who is checking their phone.
I know who is picking their nose.

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,860
I know who's wearing a red sweater in
the front row because when I'm nervous,

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,570
I can't do that.
Right.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,790
When you're in your head and oh,
I'm performing in,

13
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,130
oh no,
I hope this goes well at it.

14
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:51,860
Uh,
it's,

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,480
it's very difficult to be physically
present with all those people because

16
00:00:56,481 --> 00:01:01,481
it's too much coming at you.
But when I'm in the zone and I'm excited

17
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:05,380
and I'm tuned into this performance,
I'm able to be very much aware of WHO's

18
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,700
here,
which I think is helpful because it

19
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:10,610
allows me to be performing specifically
for this room.

20
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:15,410
The way that I perform for a classroom
of fifth graders is very different from

21
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:19,790
the way that I perform at a dive bar or
the way that I performed for a stadium

22
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:22,190
of the rehabs and people.
And it should be,

23
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,940
you should feel a difference in my
performance if you're in the audience

24
00:01:25,941 --> 00:01:29,090
for one of those shows.
So I think when I'm on stage,

25
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,760
if I'm having a great show and I'm
really tuned in,

26
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,180
you can tell because I'm able to be very
much aware and present with the people

27
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:40,340
in the room and create a show that has
meant for them.

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,400
I try to look for opportunities to
communicate that I am in the same room

29
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:51,170
that they're in.
So if I can make a joke about something

30
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:56,230
that's happening here or if I have a
reference to what city we're in or if

31
00:01:56,721 --> 00:02:00,290
someone's wearing a tee shirt that I
recognize and can associate with

32
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,290
anything like that is a way of
communicating.

33
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,340
I am in the same space you are and we're
participating in something together,

34
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,760
which also allows some part of an
audience's brain to go,

35
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,650
oh,
I really had to be here.

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,350
Which is a nice feeling to have as an
audience member.

37
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:19,100
It's a way of acknowledging that they've
taken the time to be in this space with

38
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:21,740
you and you want them to know that
you're aware of that.

39
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,950
Something that I think I will never get
over is the fact that it is a genuine

40
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:33,971
gift when people are willing to sit in
an audience and give you their time and

41
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:39,110
attention and breath.
That's something that they could have

42
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:41,930
spent anywhere else,
but they chose to give it to you here

43
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,560
and it's something that I'm very
cognizant of when I'm on stage and a big

44
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:48,830
part of what I want to do when I'm
onstage is find a way to acknowledge

45
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:52,790
those people that have come and are here
in this space and create an environment

46
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:56,090
that acknowledges that and also rewards
them for that.

47
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,180
How can we attune ourselves?
What's happening in this room so that

48
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,520
later everyone leaves feeling like,
oh,

49
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:05,700
I really had to be,
I really have to be here for that.

50
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,080
I'm glad I was a part of what happened
tonight.

51
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,670
I had a teacher in college who used to
say that when you're watching a play on

52
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:16,330
a stage,
if somebody spills a glass of water,

53
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,860
that's the most important thing that
happened in that scene because that

54
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:24,280
wasn't fake.
Nothing about water spilling is fake.

55
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,410
You see the water and everyone in the
room goes,

56
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,650
that's water and it just spelled and
that's the only thing you can focus on

57
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:33,700
because that's the most authentic piece
of what's happening in the room right

58
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,530
now.
Or if someone,

59
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,480
if there's an accident and someone gets
hurt,

60
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,900
that's the only thing you can focus on
because it's the most authentic real

61
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:42,430
thing that's happening in the room.

62
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,700
So I think when people are delivering
content and they're focused only on

63
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,800
themselves,
their delivery,

64
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,570
what they've practiced,
what they rehearsed,

65
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:56,200
what they've done to the mirror,
and they're not aware of the room.

66
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,520
Oftentimes they're performing in a
vacuum and other people can tell people

67
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:02,230
in the audience are like,
this isn't for me.

68
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,870
This is for themselves.
This is in their own brains.

69
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:10,030
I think the most powerful thing people
can do is to spill the glass of water.

70
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:13,150
Not Literally,
but to find a moment that is real,

71
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,390
to find a moment that is actually
happening here in the room with the

72
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:19,150
people here to let them know I'm with
you here.

73
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,840
Not In my own vacuum.
Practicing to the mirror somewhere that

74
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:27,430
what's happening here is a real moment.
And you can create that by acknowledging

75
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,910
something in the room by referencing
something that happened earlier that you

76
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:32,600
were all witnessed to,
uh,

77
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,890
making a reference to an inside joke
that this group of people all share

78
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:40,060
based on where you work or where you
live or the weather or what's been

79
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:44,050
happening in the news.
All of those are ways of genuinely

80
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,300
making something real here as opposed to
hoping that what you prepared in the

81
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:51,700
past is somehow maybe relevant now.
