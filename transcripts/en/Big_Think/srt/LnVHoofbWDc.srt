1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,220
Yeah,

2
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,190
he was very good company.
I love his attitude and his style,

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,240
but I think he had a
reasonable skepticism that peeled off

4
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:37,290
layers of
ideology and a presupposition in a very

5
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:43,630
useful way.
I think human causation is brilliant.

6
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:45,820
I think.
I think hume's dialogues concerning

7
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:48,760
natural religion are just wonderfully
brilliant.

8
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:50,380
I think.
I think that he,

9
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,440
he saw dimly

10
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,853
the,

11
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:02,530
the scientific world that was beginning
to emerge from,

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,450
from Newton,
and he was in a way following lock

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,480
trying to open up that exploration for
the mind.

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Uh,
and he had lots of great insights that

15
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:23,860
he developed with a very good.
