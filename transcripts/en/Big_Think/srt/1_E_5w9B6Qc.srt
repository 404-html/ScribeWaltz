1
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:08,601
Yeah,
well,

2
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:09,434
the today,
the two you just mentioned are two that 

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,290
reasons I'm cooking really.
I mean,

4
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:12,981
uh,
uh,

5
00:00:12,981 --> 00:00:13,814
Eliot Coleman as a farmer in the 
northeastern part of Maine that I was 

6
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:20,000
frustrated with this shortness of the 
growing season.

7
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:21,020
And He,
um,

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,810
uh,
well he tells a story,

9
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:24,644
it's great storyteller,
but he tells a story about how he was 

10
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:29,270
thinking of moving to France or to 
Italy.

11
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:30,104
And he was looking at a map and he saw 
that his farm is on the same latitude 

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,350
as,
um,

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,840
northern Italy and southern France 
provence.

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,100
And,
um,

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,290
he knew that,
um,

16
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,050
uh,
there were vegetables,

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,790
uh,
that were,

18
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,733
uh,
daylight determined not temperature 

19
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:50,504
determinant.
So if you could keep it above 32 

20
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:52,274
degrees,
you could grow everything that you grow 

21
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:58,580
in northern Italy and southern France in
the middle of the winter.

22
00:00:58,581 --> 00:00:59,414
You could do that in me.
And as long as you can control the 

23
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:02,420
temperature and not have it dip to 32 
degrees.

24
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,250
So he invented these,
these,

25
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,390
these really revolutionary,
uh,

26
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,150
uh,
greenhouses,

27
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:12,220
so sort of hoop houses that prevented 
ice crystallization and the planet and,

28
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:17,260
and got his farm going in ways that very
few people I've been able to do.

29
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:20,780
And now he's been mimicked all around 
the world really.

30
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,663
Um,
so he was an inspiration for me because 

31
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,850
in college when I was cooking for him on
this,

32
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,581
I was thinking,
you know,

33
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:28,610
Blue Hill farm was a great asset to,
it's,

34
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:29,444
it's,
it's 300 acres of pasture land and part 

35
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:33,290
of the problem with farming and the 
northeast of course,

36
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,700
is the weight.
What do you do from,

37
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,070
from December to May.
Uh,

38
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:40,720
and most of these farmers have other 
jobs during this time and,

39
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,530
and,
and it's a very sort of,

40
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,710
uh,
a low revenue stream time.

41
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:48,290
So,
so what elliot invented,

42
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,124
or what Elliot took advantage of was 
something that very few farmers had 

43
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:52,220
thought about.

44
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,280
Uh,
and he did it by making money doing it,

45
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,114
which is the key.
So he was a huge influence in me and my 

46
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,630
thinking that,
you know,

47
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,120
ultimately if I got good enough and,
and,

48
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,890
and could be,
uh,

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,810
uh,
Neil can make a career of cooking,

50
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:07,410
you know,
Blue Hill would be an asset for,

51
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:08,244
for a supply chain.
And then there's Joel Salitan who did 

52
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,350
everything and I'm just talking about 
really on the animal.

53
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:15,950
And it took advantage of this landscape 
in ways that other farmers hadn't by,

54
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,173
um,
by raising different species of animals 

55
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:19,904
in the same space.
And so both of these men informed me 

56
00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:24,794
greatly and then ultimately stone barns 
great late because we've kind of 

57
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:29,600
mimicked each of their operations at 
stone barns,

58
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:32,210
made it our own for Westchester County,
but they're,

59
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,510
their basic philosophy,
uh,

60
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,020
is,

61
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,640
is all over the place.
It's humbling.

62
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,160
Well,
we have this 23,000

63
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:45,450
square foot greenhouse,
for example,

64
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:46,560
on the Elliot side,
right?

65
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:47,550
So,
uh,

66
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,920
that's Eliot Coleman writ large and 
it's,

67
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,180
um,
and it's,

68
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,890
uh,
made for him.

69
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:54,780
It was built for,
uh,

70
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,760
uh,
uh,

71
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,850
you know,
based on,

72
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,830
on Westchester County,
which is to say,

73
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,470
uh,
that the taxes,

74
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,323
the,
the Labor that's a necessary for this 

75
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:06,760
part of the country versus where Elliot 
is.

76
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,310
So it needed to be quite a bit larger 
than what Elliot does.

77
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,473
Uh,
but the underpinnings of what he wrote 

78
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:15,490
so outright,
what he writes so eloquently about talks

79
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:19,330
about going about is,
is a strong soil,

80
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,040
uh,
and,

81
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,230
uh,
planting,

82
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,730
uh,
vegetables,

83
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,930
uh,
that,

84
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,870
uh,
take advantage of our natural,

85
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,000
um,
uh,

86
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,410
you know,
our natural ecology.

87
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:33,850
So for example,
you know,

88
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,250
we now,
I just harvested last week,

89
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,650
um,
we just harvested the farm,

90
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,810
just harvested,
um,

91
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,930
carrots from both the greenhouse and the
field,

92
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,110
and they're the best carrots of the 
year.

93
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,973
And so what,
what people generally talk about the 

94
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:51,040
northeast as I was saying before,
is,

95
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,760
you know,
it's,

96
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,380
it's dead during the winter,
right?

97
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,393
But in fact,
for certain vegetables like root 

98
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:56,741
vegetables,
carrots,

99
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:59,340
and parsnips and Rutabaga and,
and,

100
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,380
and celery root,
um,

101
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,210
if you are willing to use hoop houses or
use something that,

102
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,670
that can prevent the temperature from 
falling below 32 degrees,

103
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:14,440
you can actually have vegetables that 
are better than any place in the country

104
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:19,060
because the starches through the coal,
through the freezing turn to sugars,

105
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,560
uh,
with these phrases.

106
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,670
So,
um,

107
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,580
you know,
we took a bricks test of this carrot.

108
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,140
Now I,
this particular card,

109
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,320
I went on the Internet and I found the 
bricks test is,

110
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:30,520
uh,
the parts per billion of sugar in the,

111
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,390
in the vegetable,
right?

112
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,050
So we squeezed a little bit of carrot 
juice on and took a reading and I looked

113
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:38,130
on the internet and they said the 
highest reading for this type of care,

114
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:39,400
it was 14.6.

115
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,600
It took,
uh,

116
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,100
took,
uh,

117
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,820
uh,
thought of it and read it.

118
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:45,310
And it was 15.8
literally off the charts.

119
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,473
Right?
And so I was speaking to a plant 

120
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:50,650
scientist who happens also to be a poet.
And I think he described it.

121
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,543
That's what's going on.
He said that when a vegetable gets 

122
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:57,844
through a root vegetable or actually 
other vegetables like Kale and Swiss 

123
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:03,860
chard and uh,
and um,

124
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,230
uh,
Brussel sprouts,

125
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,710
but in this case and dead of winter when
these root vegetables and they're in the

126
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:11,290
ground,
feel the freeze coming,

127
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,273
they convert the starches to sugars to 
try and raise their body temperature 

128
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:18,130
about like making ice cream to vent ice 
crystallization.

129
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,053
They're raising their body temperatures,
like the ice crystallization means 

130
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:22,960
death.
So he said,

131
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,180
I think poetically,
uh,

132
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,073
you know,
what you're tasting is sweetness and 

133
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,640
what the plant is telling you is I don't
want to die.

134
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,010
It's really interesting.
So it's taking advantage,

135
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:33,844
I mean this is sort of Elliot and Joel's
in any of these sustainable agriculture 

136
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,683
minded individuals is taking advantage 
of your natural ecology to produce 

137
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:45,340
delicious and by definition,
healthful food.

138
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,790
That's a low impact on your environment.
So that's,

139
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,410
that's there.
And then on the,

140
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:52,440
on the animal side of things,
um,

141
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,710
one of the great benefits of being in 
this New England areas,

142
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:59,480
grass is grassland.
So,

143
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,561
uh,
you know,

144
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,800
our goal and the goal of the farmers 
that,

145
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,703
that practice,
the animal husbandry at stone barns is 

146
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,360
to,
is to,

147
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,223
to take advantage to keep their eye on 
the sunlight and have the sunlight feed 

148
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,640
the grass and have the grasp of the 
animals and the animals feed us,

149
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,970
you know,
so that the minimum amount of,

150
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,833
of grain inputs that we can take from 
other farms outside of stone barns and 

151
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:24,050
use what's in our own natural ecology.
It's what provides not only,

152
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,440
you know,
the most sustainable meats,

153
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,363
but also the most delicious because the,
the grass is this buffet of different 

154
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,640
flavors and,
and nutrients and,

155
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:37,070
uh,
and it adds subtleties and the flavor of

156
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:37,904
the meat that you can't find elsewhere.
