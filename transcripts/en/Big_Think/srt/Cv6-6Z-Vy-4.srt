1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,750
Well,
actually that day,

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,990
everything,
fairly verizon in my life,

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,870
I don't know what I don't know about
anyone else's life,

4
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:21,871
but in my life,
everything for a reason and even bad

5
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:26,590
things as far as reason that who knows,
it might turn out for be something else.

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,480
Um,
but

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,650
you know,
I don't fight creativity.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,610
I don't fight against not being
creative.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,090
If I'm not being creative and not
forcing it,

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,950
I just,
that's it.

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,070
I'm chilling.
You know what I'm saying?

12
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,210
What inspire me.
Yeah.

13
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:52,050
I want to say it's God.
Yeah,

14
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,903
Gia.

15
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,740
But I want to put it a different,
we,

16
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:57,060
we say it's the universe.
You know,

17
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:59,190
it's this thing that we don't know what
it's called.

18
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,550
Some people call it garden.
People have different names for it.

19
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:04,980
I don't know why they call it whatever
you want to call it.

20
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,800
I don't know.
Sometime I just said the universe,

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,090
that's what I call it at times.
And that's what inspires me.

22
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,500
You know,
the universe.

23
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,650
So that's,
it did,

24
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,450
I mean my kids,
um,

25
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,440
as I said before,
bucking the D is Amir.

26
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:27,420
But every now and again there is some
social thing that was Pakistan.

27
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,330
I song about justice,
our Asana board,

28
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:34,800
human rights are every know and again,
there's something happening in the world

29
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,933
where,
uh,

30
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,790
all right,
that's sung inspired by what's

31
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,870
happening.
But a lot of times,

32
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:43,200
no,
I'm writing songs

33
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,080
that,
that,

34
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,280
that has to do with it all I'd have to
do with

35
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,960
establishing um,
oh,

36
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,960
ah,
reestablishing our connection to the

37
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:59,480
universe.
I was,

38
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,140
oh,
uh,

39
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,331
oh,
uh,

40
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:02,850
spirituality,
you know,

41
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,620
re reconnecting our consciousness to
universities that has nothing to do with

42
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,350
physical things are social things are
political things.

43
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,590
It's all to do with spiritual things.
And that's where I find that's where I

44
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:21,420
love to write songs,
the Moss in that place,

45
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,790
not in the political social thing.
I like to write songs in that spiritual

46
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:27,390
please.
That's,

47
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,670
that's what that given the best feeling.
You know,

48
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,490
this advice I ever receive.

49
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,300
There's has been a few,
but I must say today,

50
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:43,420
the best advice I ever received is one
that

51
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,160
I would say I received from myself
because it's based upon my experiences

52
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,770
and the best advice I received from Maya
said,

53
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:57,940
if is follow your intuition,
follow your mind.

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,770
Cause mean many times I have not,
and I've seen where I should have.

55
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,380
So I,
and you know each individual to each his

56
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:09,940
own.
It's not sometimes,

57
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,910
not everybody's intuition is,
is an thing.

58
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:16,630
But where I am today in my life,
my intuition,

59
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,400
I should follow it.
And that is,

60
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:21,340
that is the advice I get from that inner
voice inside of me.

61
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,020
You know,
that speaks,

62
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,510
there's a voice inside them that speaks
the truth.

63
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,720
And I must always listen to that device.
If I did,

64
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:30,310
I wouldn't get money.
You wouldn't be in general.

65
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:34,000
Right?
That's the lesson.

66
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,450
That's the lesson zig and listened to
that.

67
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,690
That's,
that's the lesson.

68
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:39,490
That's what I'm talking about.
I learned something,

69
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:39,790
you know.
