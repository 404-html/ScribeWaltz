1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,830
We are shaped by group level of
selection processes so that we can be

2
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:14,920
like bees in a hive.
Um,

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,100
we are not just primates.
We evolved to fight it out with other

4
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:20,050
primates.
Uh,

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,060
we are part way through a major
transition evolutionary history that

6
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:26,420
allows us to be temporarily like bees in
a hive.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,810
We see this after a attacks.
We saw it after nine 11.

8
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:32,840
We can come together our propensity to
find meaning,

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,030
even though it may have evolved from
simpler cognitive mechanisms as Richard

10
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,770
Dawkins and others maintain.
Um,

11
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,310
I believe that our ability to find
connections to see connections in the

12
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:44,600
stars.
If we look up at the sky,

13
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:48,080
we see stories about people wandering
around and going on missions.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,750
Um,
I believe that our ability to find

15
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:53,900
connections and meaning helps us merge
together into groups,

16
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,490
uh,
that can function as one.

17
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,190
Um,
so this is part of the psychology that

18
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:01,070
allows us to create these emergent super
organisms,

19
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:02,640
at least temporarily.
Um,

20
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:07,190
anyone who's ever been in part of being
in a chorus or band or played a team

21
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:09,230
sport or been initiated into a
fraternity,

22
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:14,210
knows the joy is the ecstasy of losing
yourself in part of a larger group.

23
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,870
I think this is the next frontier for
psychology and for the social sciences

24
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,380
is understanding that we are not radical
individuals.

25
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:25,910
We are actually in part bees in a hive,
but we don't live that way.

26
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,140
And that's the reason for as much,

27
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,123
right?

28
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:38,330
We are deeply and profoundly
confirmation secrets not truth seekers.

29
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,780
The most important rule in psychology is
that thinking is for doing.

30
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,810
Now there are some people whose task it
is to find the truth.

31
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:47,990
So you might think they would use
thinking to find the truth.

32
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:50,990
And there are some philosophers I think
who are very open minded.

33
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:52,130
There are some,
uh,

34
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,140
but for the most part,
philosophers are human beings too.

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,060
Uh,
and they use reasoning to reach the

36
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:58,240
conclusion that they find a minute,
uh,

37
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,070
amenable or conducive.
Um,

38
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,680
um,
you have to look back at the divisions

39
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:06,740
of the mind and realize that our
language ability,

40
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,910
our ability to think in words,
did not come about so that we could

41
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:13,990
figure things out.
Language came about to communicate and

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,960
especially to influence.
We use reasoning to influence others,

43
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,060
to manage our reputation to,
to,

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,520
to work out well,
what will people think of me if I do

45
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:23,060
this?

46
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,940
And is that person trying to cheat me?
We use reasoning,

47
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,960
uh,
uh,

48
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,180
in a machiavellian way.
Quite often.

49
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,640
Um,
we are capable of using it to find the

50
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:33,560
truth when we don't care about the
truth.

51
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,990
And this is why the natural sciences do
such a good job.

52
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,940
They can really reason their way to the
conclusion offered by the data and the

53
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:42,530
social sciences.
We have a big problem.

54
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,170
Almost all of us are liberal,
not in economics,

55
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,890
but in psychology,
sociology,

56
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,800
anthropology,
almost all of us are liberal.

57
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,950
So we reasoned our way to conclusions we
want to reach,

58
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:53,990
which are liberal conclusions.
Um,

59
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,360
and this makes it very hard for us to
understand society,

60
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,410
religion,
politics,

61
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,800
knowledge.
Okay.

62
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,290
The basic personality trait is that
predicts ideology best is openness to

63
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,720
experience.
This is just a fact about the

64
00:03:11,721 --> 00:03:14,840
distribution of personality types.
Just as some people are extroverted,

65
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:17,480
some introverted,
it's always going to be the case as part

66
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:20,840
of a genetic shuffle.
But some people just like novelty

67
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:22,970
variety and diversity,
other people like what's familiar.

68
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,280
Um,
I'm really glad it's this way.

69
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,220
Uh,
we need in any community we need people

70
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:31,130
of both types.
What happens now that we have so much

71
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:34,880
geographic mobility is the people who
are high in openness to experience can't

72
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,880
stand to live in small towns.
They all moved to New York and San

73
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,820
Francisco and Boston create communities
that are very high in openness to

74
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,070
experience in which there is no moral
diversity,

75
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,050
uh,
whereas other people who are born low

76
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:47,360
and more on openness to experience and
move out.

77
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,300
Um,
so we now get geographic and social

78
00:03:50,301 --> 00:03:53,210
clustering where we only have to deal
with people who are like us.

79
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,500
Um,
the food is really,

80
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,140
really good where we liberals live
because we like ethnic foods.

81
00:03:57,141 --> 00:04:00,080
We like variety in the more conservative
parts of the country.

82
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:02,600
It seems like all the restaurants are
applebee's because they don't like

83
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,450
bright in diversity,
uh,

84
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,220
that much.
So this basic personality trait,

85
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,010
um,
drives so much else that happens and

86
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:13,820
leads us to cluster into groups.
It used to be that at least if you were

87
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:15,530
born in one place,
you were likely to stay,

88
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,880
that most people stayed and you
associated with people who were near

89
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:21,380
you.
But we're often different from you.

90
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,330
Not Anymore.
Now we've got lots of,

91
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,220
of racial and ethnic diversity.
That's great.

92
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,420
But we've been able to purchase it at
the cost of almost no model diversity.

93
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,330
The data suggests that Americans are
among the happiest people in the world.

94
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,980
Um,
uh,

95
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,560
it's the scandinavians also do extremely
well on that.

96
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,650
Um,
the most important thing to realize for

97
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:51,510
those who doubt that those who doubt
that Americans are happy is to realize

98
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:53,640
that happiness is really local.
Um,

99
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,190
our society is screwed up in a lot of
ways.

100
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,900
Uh,
we have a lot of poverty.

101
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,320
We have a lot of injustice.
We have a broken political system,

102
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,710
um,
and some of that matters for happiness.

103
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:07,380
But for the most part,
our happiness comes from our local

104
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:08,670
environment,
from our relationships,

105
00:05:08,671 --> 00:05:10,680
from having control over our lives.
Um,

106
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,950
I do think the data suggests that,
uh,

107
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,790
freedom is good for people.
Uh,

108
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,860
up to a point.
Um,

109
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,590
mobility and diversity are not so good
for people.

110
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,820
Uh,
they do,

111
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,740
uh,
they do make us trust our neighbors

112
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:23,640
less.
Uh,

113
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:27,990
so anything that fosters strong
relationships and stable,

114
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,820
a stable,
a healthy,

115
00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:31,560
cohesive communities is generally good
for us.

116
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,200
Um,
but anything that fosters anime and

117
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:39,180
distrust and chaos is bad for us.
I think America could do a lot better.

118
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:42,090
I think we could be even happier than we
are if we could fix some of our social

119
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,260
problems.
Um,

120
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,780
but I do think that despite all of our
problems,

121
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,730
uh,
Americans seem to be doing pretty well

122
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:49,020
on a happiness scale.

123
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,113
Okay.

124
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,250
Myth of pure evil is a term

125
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,200
coined by the psychologist Roy
Baumeister.

126
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,140
Um,
which talks about a kind of a narrative

127
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:05,160
that we all have in our minds.
Um,

128
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,440
it's parodied most perfectly in the
Austin Powers movies in which there is a

129
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,310
Dr Evil who does evil because he loves
to do evil.

130
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,350
There's no other motive.
He just likes to do evil.

131
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,080
Um,
uh,

132
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,310
we on the other hand are perfectly good.
We fight evil.

133
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,340
So it takes extent that you have bumper
stickers on your car.

134
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,780
Things like,
if you don't like abortion,

135
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:25,300
don't have one.
Um,

136
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,910
um,
you think that you are on the good side

137
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:31,870
and those ignorant fools and the other
side are evil,

138
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,800
uh,
driven by ignorance or greed.

139
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,900
Um,
we liberals tend to think about racism

140
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:36,740
in this way,
especially.

141
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,340
We think that racism is pure evil and
racism happens for no reason.

142
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:41,750
It just falls out of the sky.

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,970
Um,
and it's a disease and a virus.

144
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,880
We must all unite to fight this pure
evil.

145
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,170
This is what I mean when I say morality
is a team sport and Airside is united by

146
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:54,470
fighting the pure evil of racism.
Um,

147
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,160
the reality is always more complicated
as baumeister shows,

148
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,650
even in domestic violence,
one of the most obvious cases of

149
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:04,130
apparent case of pure evil,
whether you're looking at domestic

150
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:05,480
violence,
racial assaults,

151
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:07,520
whatever it is,
murder especially,

152
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,250
there's usually,
uh,

153
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,580
uh,
an escalation.

154
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,860
There's usually some fault on both
sides.

155
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:14,960
It hurts me to say that I know that
people watching this are going to be

156
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:17,750
offended because I've just said
something sack religious for our,

157
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,710
our social justice side.
Um,

158
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,890
but the reality is always more
complicated.

159
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,320
Um,
you cannot understand the atrocities in

160
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:26,390
the world by thinking they are caused by
evil.

161
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:29,090
In fact,
almost all the trustees are caused by

162
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:32,150
people pursuing the good,
who believe at the ends.

163
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,280
Justify the means.
There is no pure evil.

164
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,020
It's actually moral motives,
a cloaked in a cloak of self

165
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:39,650
righteousness.
