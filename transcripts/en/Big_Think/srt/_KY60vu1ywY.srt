1
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,120
As a cold sort of statute like figure as
a person who,

2
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,040
um,
was he seen almost,

3
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,190
he's portrayed almost like a,
like a sherlock holmes character,

4
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,820
sort of all intellect and primarily
intellect and not a person of passion.

5
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,640
He was a deeply emotional person and
like lots of emotional people try to

6
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:47,151
hide that by appearing somewhat detached
and aloof.

7
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,550
So I think the notion of a,
of a cold and cerebral Jefferson is,

8
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,420
um,
is a misconception.

9
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,960
I mean he was almost irrational in some
ways,

10
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,080
in,
in passions about politics,

11
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:03,030
about people,
all kinds of things.

12
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,420
So that would be it getting rid of,
uh,

13
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:06,900
the,
the sort of Coal Jefferson,

14
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,080
there's this notion of him as someone
who's just sort of unfeeling,

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,040
detached person and there's just,
that's not right.

16
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,740
I mean,
he's a very much a man of sentiment and

17
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:20,430
feeling and that I think comes through
and what,

18
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:22,620
as you said,
with his attitudes about,

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,513
about,
um,

20
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,000
about wine and food and architecture and
all those kinds of things,

21
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:29,880
but he's not,
he's not all mind the head and heart.

22
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,600
The famous letter that he writes to
Maria,

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,590
Maria cosway.
Um,

24
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,390
and a lot of people assumed,
well,

25
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:39,570
the headwinds because that's what
Jefferson is,

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,370
but I don't,
I don't think that that's true.
