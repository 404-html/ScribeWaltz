1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,150
Some of the most interesting studies
near death and out of body experiences

2
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:11,940
were run by the air force,
right?

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,080
As airplanes got faster and faster and
faster over the past 20 years,

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,660
right?
Pilots kept flying themselves into g

5
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:20,910
lock,
gravity induced loss of consciousness.

6
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:22,710
Right?
And they kept crashing.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,060
So a guy named James winner was,
was a guy kind of charged with solving

8
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:30,030
this problem.
And what he did is down in Texas,

9
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:35,031
he spun like a thousand pilots in a
giant centrifuge into g lock.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,680
Right?
And as he was doing it,

11
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:42,681
he noticed something interesting.
She locked means you pass out and if

12
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:46,470
you've experienced it,
what actually happens is your vision

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,680
forms into a tunnel.
It looks like if you're,

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,180
if you're watching it,
it looks like an old television set

15
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:54,570
turning off where it goes down into one
point and then disappears.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,410
Right?
So it looks experientially a lot like

17
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:01,950
you're walking down a long dark tunnel,
which is kind of one of the classic near

18
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:02,970
death experience.

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,470
A phenomenon.
What he discovered along the way is that

20
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,510
as he started spitting people towards g
lock,

21
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,980
kind of the longer he spun them,
people started reporting out of body

22
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:17,010
experiences and after they were out of
their body,

23
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:20,550
if he kept spitting them,
it would turn into a near death

24
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:21,540
experience.
Right?

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,320
So he's the person that he was,
air force is the person,

26
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,180
the US Air Force discovered that outer
body experiences in near death

27
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:32,510
experiences are actually on the same
continuum there.

28
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,570
They're part of the same chain of effect
and a lot of it has to do with the right

29
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:39,900
temporal lobe.
There's other things going on as well.

30
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,450
And there are of course certain
mysteries,

31
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:44,550
right?
There are unsolved things in near death

32
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:47,550
experiences.
We've got lots and lots and lots of

33
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:52,551
research that shows people report things
when they were supposedly dead that they

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,620
should not have known about at all.

35
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,590
So there are people who died on
operating tables,

36
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,900
right in research.
Studies came back,

37
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:02,910
were brought back.
They had near death experiences,

38
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,900
and while they were dead,
the nurse would take their glasses off

39
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:10,230
and put it in a drawer,
and later when everybody was running

40
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:15,180
around looking around for their glasses,
the person who was on the operating

41
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:17,130
table at the time,
the patient who was dead at the time

42
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:17,491
said,
oh yeah,

43
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:20,050
they're in the bottom drawer over there.
And this is a Pimm's Bon Llama Lamo

44
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:21,510
study that was actually done in the
Netherlands.

45
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:24,810
This is where that actually happened.
But there's a lots and lots of

46
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,140
experiences like that.
So somewhere along the line,

47
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,300
information is getting through,
right?

48
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,850
We don't know that yet.
That's still the mystery.

49
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,300
But a lot of the other stuff,
we understand the biology behind it now.
