1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,613
Yeah,

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,960
I first and foremost a Christian.
And that means not only that I draw my

3
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:14,700
inspiration from the Bible,
but also for me.

4
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:17,460
I'm an Orthodox Christian,
so it's also from the great creed,

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,330
the apostles,
creed,

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,590
creed,
and so on.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,240
Um,
and that is a bedrock for my life.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,320
I,
and I wouldn't say that I'm a great

9
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:31,920
Christian in the sense that I can always
do what I think are what to do,

10
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:34,260
but I tend to,
I once read a book,

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,610
uh,
by an episcopal done.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,810
Yes,
there are fiscal sponsor and what

13
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,260
triggered what sort of government,
episcopal nun who said that,

14
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:44,010
um,
you can't see the future and it's,

15
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,140
you can't tell what God wants to do five
years from now,

16
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:48,160
but if you look carefully,
we take the time to get general,

17
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,560
tell what you're supposed to do right
now.

18
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,380
Uh,
and I try to think of things that way.

19
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,090
I try to think about what I should do
right now.

20
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:56,010
I tend to be a thoughtful person.
I tend to be someone.

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,190
I don't make snap judgments.
I like to take time to think things

22
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,160
over.
Um,

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,240
and then want to make decisions.
I tend to stick to them but they tend to

24
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:05,010
be social.
I made over a period of time.

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,560
We live in a world that encourages snap
judgments,

26
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:11,870
that rewards thinking fast and I don't
think that makes for very good decision.

27
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,190
Making.
My wife I should say is also a great

28
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:15,660
inspiration to me.
Um,

29
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,900
uh,
my wife is not only a Christian but

30
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:23,070
someone who tries to live our faith and
really thinks very hard about the right

31
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:25,560
thing to do.
She currently is involved in issues that

32
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:29,310
I think are of great importance.
She's apprentice lawyer as I am.

33
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:31,500
She's working with Jones defense one as
well as being corporate law.

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,590
Before that she now affiliated with a
couple of think tanks and she's

35
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:36,620
interested in the future of mothering
in,

36
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,140
in America and in the world.
And she's interested in the

37
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,390
commodification of children in two
senses.

38
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:43,630
Both the,
the,

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,960
the sense in which we might say the
commercialization of childhood

40
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,980
advertising aimed at children trying to
create little consumers and also

41
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,920
commodification of different sense of
the notion of designer babies.

42
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,410
And what does that say about humanity,
about us,

43
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:58,320
and about our future?
She doesn't go into these things as a

44
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:00,570
shrill advocate.
She goes to these things to try to

45
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:05,040
understand the direction we're moving
and to try to encourage conversations

46
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,530
about these directions.
What I like about her approach is

47
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:10,290
exactly that,
that she wants to encourage conversation

48
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:14,580
when she wants to do is create a world
which people think about issues and then

49
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,710
talk about them as opposed to go on
television.

50
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:21,360
You rant and rave about them.
I think that's the kind of work that I

51
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:24,050
wish more advocates would do.
It's kind of work that I used to

52
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,900
[inaudible].
