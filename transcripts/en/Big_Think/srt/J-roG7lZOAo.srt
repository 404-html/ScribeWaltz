1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,150
I think of what happened,
yes.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,900
Today or just recently on fit with
facebook where they've,

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,980
you know,
developed a way to capitalize on the

4
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:20,690
fact that people are sharing information
with you know,

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,590
50 million people and other people who
are of a like mind and they're going to

6
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:29,580
attach at advertising to these messages.
And I think you have to be really

7
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:34,581
careful that the advertising doesn't
become so intrusive that it,

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,100
it,
it's greeted in a hostile environment.

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,640
I remember many years ago,
like the 10 or 15 years ago,

10
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,000
there was an idea to put advertising on
the,

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,830
um,
on the,

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,870
on the runways where the baggage was
being the baggage runways and airports

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,940
so that while you were standing there,
oh,

14
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:57,240
wondering if your baggage was actually
going to come through the door.

15
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,460
You could be looking at advertising on
the,

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,500
on the rubber,
on the rubber strips.

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,450
And I don't know if that was ever done.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,300
I don't know if it was some APP,
some airports may have actually done

19
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:09,390
that.
And that was an interesting idea to try

20
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:11,640
and sell somebody something while they
were bored or,

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,880
or terrified that they'll love luggage
wasn't going to show up.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,580
I don't know that that was ever done in
great numbers.

23
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:20,010
I certainly don't remember seeing it and
the travels I've done.

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,580
But you have to be careful when you
surround the consumer with advertising

25
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:26,700
messaging that you don't irritate them
in the process.

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,190
And that means that you have to be
entertaining,

27
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,250
you have to make them,
you have to be appealing,

28
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:34,770
you have to make them want to watch what
you're saying,

29
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,160
your messaging,
you have to be a craftsman.

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,180
So a lot of the user generated
advertising might be interesting now and

31
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:45,780
I think it's fun to think about it and,
and some of it is actually pretty good.

32
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,710
I think it's still an art form.
Advertising and the creative end of

33
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:54,711
advertising is still needs art artists
and craftsmen and people who are good at

34
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:59,991
storytelling and creating imagery and
making things beautiful and interesting

35
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:03,370
to watch.
So I don't know that uh,

36
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,810
the user generated commercials are going
to take over there.

37
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:08,700
It's kind of interesting now.
I like them.

38
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:11,070
I think it's fun,
but there's always,

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,840
it's like a mosaic,
you know?

40
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,130
There's a place for everything.
