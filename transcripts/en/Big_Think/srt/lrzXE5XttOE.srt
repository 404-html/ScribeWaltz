1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,620
Mm,

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,260
when you look at us,
us as humans,

3
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:08,610
as apes,
as primates,

4
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:12,090
as mammals,
when you look at some of the most

5
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:16,770
appalling realms of our behavior,
much of it has to do with the fact that

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,920
social organisms are really,
really hardwired to make a basic

7
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:27,141
dichotomy about the social world,
which is those organisms who count as us

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,080
and those who count is them and this is
virtually universal among humans and

9
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:38,340
this is virtually universal among all
sorts of social primates that have

10
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:42,780
aspects of social structure is built
around separate social groupings of

11
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,750
them's.
We turn the world into us as investors

12
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,770
and we don't like them very much and are
often really awful to them and the is.

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,010
We exaggerate how wonderful and how
generous and how affiliated and how.

14
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:57,900
Just like siblings,
they are to us.

15
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,610
We divide the world into us and them and
one of the greatest ways of seeing just

16
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:05,580
biologically how real this fault line
is,

17
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,280
is there's this hormone,
oxytocin.

18
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,270
Oxytocin is officially the coolest
grooviest hormone on earth because what

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,880
everybody knows is it enhances mother
infant bonding and it enhances pair

20
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:24,540
bonding and couples and it makes you
more trusting and empathic and

21
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,750
emotionally expressive and better at
reasoning,

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,980
reading expressions,
more charitable,

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,480
and it's obvious that if you just like
spritzed oxytocin of everyone's noses on

24
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:36,280
this planet,
it would be the garden the next day.

25
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:41,330
Oxytocin promotes prosocial behavior
until people look closely and it turns

26
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:47,691
out oxytocin does all these wondrous
things only for people who you think of

27
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:50,700
as an us,
as an in group member.

28
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,260
It improves in group favoritism,
in group parochialism.

29
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,710
What does it do to individuals who you
consider then it makes you crappy or to

30
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:03,720
them more preemptively,
aggressive,

31
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,120
less cooperative,
and an economic game.

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,360
What oxytocin does is enhanced this us
and them divide so that along with other

33
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:17,320
findings,
classical lines of us versus them along

34
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:19,740
the lines of race,
of sex,

35
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,890
of age,
of social,

36
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:21,750
economic class.

37
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,220
Your brain processes these us them
differences on the scale of

38
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:28,740
milliseconds.
A 20th of a second,

39
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,910
your brain is already responding
differently to an US versus them.

40
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,770
Okay,
so collectively,

41
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,500
this is depressing as hell.
Oh my God,

42
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:42,501
we are hardwired to inevitably be awful
to them's and them's along all sorts of

43
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,570
disturbing lines of,
Oh,

44
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:48,270
if only we could overcome these us,
them dichotomy's,

45
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:49,830
the worldly.
Oh No.

46
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:54,831
Are we hard wire to divide the world
along lines of race and ethnicity and

47
00:02:55,621 --> 00:03:00,621
nationality and all those disturbing
things and what becomes clear is when

48
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:05,791
you look closely is it is virtually
inevitable that we divide the world into

49
00:03:05,991 --> 00:03:09,520
offices and thems and don't like them
very much into treat them well,

50
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,760
but we are incredibly easily manipulated
as to who counts as an us and who counts

51
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:19,270
is of them and those fault lines that we
view as,

52
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,330
oh my God,
how ancient can you get that?

53
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,330
Say somebody of another race of volks
limbic responses in US commensurate with

54
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,100
they are them.
They respond,

55
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,450
they motivate automatic responses.
Oh my God.

56
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:39,160
Is that just the basic fault line and
then you do something like have faces of

57
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:44,161
same race versus other race and either
they are or aren't wearing a baseball

58
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:48,980
cap with your favorite team's logo on it
and you completely redefined who's in

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,540
us.
US is people who like the Yankees and

60
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:57,370
them are red sox fans and suddenly
you're processing within milliseconds

61
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:02,290
what damn baseball cap they haven't race
as being completely ignored.

62
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,620
Oh my God,
we are negatively hardwired to make

63
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:10,150
really distressing us that were
manipulated within seconds as to who

64
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,510
counts as us as event.
Good news with that,

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,780
we can manipulate us out of some of our
worst us,

66
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:19,270
them dichotomy's and recategorize
people.

67
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,990
Bad News.
We could be manipulated by all sorts of

68
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:27,991
audio logs out there as to deciding that
people who seem just like us really are

69
00:04:28,521 --> 00:04:28,750
into.

70
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,390
They're really so different that they
count as of them.

71
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,090
Okay,
so fabulous study showing this,

72
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:39,091
this double edged quality to oxytocin
and this was a study done by a group in

73
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:44,170
the Netherlands and what they did was
they took Dutch university student

74
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:47,470
volunteers and they gave him classic
philosophy problem.

75
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:51,640
The runaway trolley problem,
is it okay to sacrifice one person to

76
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:56,410
save five runaway trolley?
Can you push this big beefy guy onto the

77
00:04:56,411 --> 00:05:00,490
track who gets squashed by the trolley,
but that slows it down so that five

78
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:04,240
people tied to the attractive standard
problem at philosophy,

79
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:07,600
utilitarianism and justifies means all
of that.

80
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:12,130
So you give people the scenario and
people have varying opinions and now you

81
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:17,131
give them the scenario where the person
you push onto the track has a name and

82
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,610
either it's a standard name from
Netherlands.

83
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:24,070
Dirk,
I think who's like a peer to peer or

84
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:25,570
something which like if you're.

85
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,110
This is like a,
like a meat and potatoes Netherlandish

86
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:34,130
name or a name from either of two groups
that evoke lots of Zena phobic hostility

87
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:39,400
among people from the Netherlands.
Someone with a typically German name.

88
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,080
Oh yeah.
World War II.

89
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,580
That's right.
That was a problem.

90
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,760
Or someone with a typically Muslim name,
so now they're choosing whether to save

91
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:52,801
five by pushing dirt onto the track or
auto or Mahmoud and in general give them

92
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:57,410
those names and there's no difference in
how people would rate it.

93
00:05:57,411 --> 00:06:01,730
Then if they were anonymous,
give people oxytocin where they don't

94
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:05,270
know that they've gotten it.
Controlled group has just placebo spurts

95
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:09,340
up their nose.
Give people oxytocin and Kumbaya.

96
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,050
You were far less likely to push dirt
onto the track and dirk is add,

97
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:19,270
you are now far more likely to push good
old auto or good old mom onto the rails

98
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:24,050
there and you are more likely to
sacrifice an out group member to save

99
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,410
five and you're less likely to sacrifice
an ingroup member.

100
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,300
All you've done there is exaggerate the
US than divide with that.
