1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:02,803
Yeah.

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,140
Working in Africa,
I'm very conscious that there are 53

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,650
countries and that they are moving at
different speeds.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,880
And the two also have important Pan
African and regional African

5
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:20,250
institutions.
Uh,

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,530
there was a reform of the African Union
and it has a commission,

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,720
like the commission of the European
Union.

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,480
Half the members of that commission are
women.

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,400
So there's a big commitment to gender in
m a lot of issues in many of the

10
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:34,360
countries.
Now,

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,880
there is a real sense that things are
moving forward.

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,170
And there was a recent Pew opinion,
uh,

13
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,290
sampling taken and most of the African
countries sampled,

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,050
really felt there's a lot of room for
improvement,

15
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:49,750
but we're on the right road commitment
to the Millennium Goals,

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,000
better governments tackling corruption.
So I think there's a tendency sometimes

17
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:59,140
to sort of write off Africa and a sweep
as being a basket case or something far

18
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:01,810
from it.
Now they're actually very interesting

19
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,600
and very progressive things happening in
many of the countries in Africa.
