1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,800
Well,
I,

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,800
I think religious communities are
extremely important as ways of

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,040
reinforcing individuals,
commitments and identities and that

4
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,670
will,
that continues to be the case and,

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,440
and will continue to be the case,
uh,

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,460
whether there is a rising tide of
secularism as some argue or a rising

7
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:34,470
tide of a resurgence of religion
worldwide,

8
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:35,700
as,
as others argue,

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,620
I think depends very much on which
country we look at.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,920
I think if we look at the broader sweep
of human history,

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,040
then the,
it's clear the outlier is Europe and

12
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,850
America in so far as it had western
Europe from the enlightenment on and the

13
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,200
United States in so far as it is
followed that pattern and it was only in

14
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:04,230
perfectly and perfectly followed it for
the rest of human history.

15
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,740
Religion has always been a dimension of
people's finding,

16
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:12,300
their identity and,
and the affirming values and I think

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,080
into a significant degree that is again,
happening worldwide.

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,800
Now.
The most visible form of it is Islam in

19
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:24,801
which it's clear Islam is playing a
major geopolitical role that it hasn't

20
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:26,490
for,
for some centuries,

21
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,580
but it's not only Islam,
it's also clear that religious,

22
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:33,750
a resurgence a is evident in other
communities as well.

23
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,530
Uh,
I personally am A.

24
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,530
I'm a Christian who is,
who's Christian identity is,

25
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,870
would be disputed by a great many
Christians.

26
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,900
Uh,
and I guess I could tell you a story

27
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:49,530
about that.
In,

28
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,900
in 1969,
1970,

29
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:56,901
I spent a year in Sri Lanka studying
Buddhism and my Buddhist conversation

30
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:00,500
partners,
uh,

31
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,200
we're convinced that,
that what defined a Christian was that a

32
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:09,201
Christian believed in God is a being
outside the world who created the world,

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,750
number one.
And number two,

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,800
that a Christian believed in that every
individual what had an immortal soul.

35
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,520
And when I told him that I didn't
believe either of those propositions,

36
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:25,770
but considered myself a Christian,
they said,

37
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:26,760
well,
that's impossible.

38
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:30,420
You can't be a Christian unless you
believe in a god outside the world who

39
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:33,750
created the world in an immortal soul.
Uh,

40
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,200
now many Christians would agree those
are very important for defining

41
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:41,130
Christianity.
So my kind of Buddhist Christianity or

42
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:43,530
Buddhist influence Christianity is,
is,

43
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:44,340
uh,
an,

44
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,790
an od,
a combination of affirmations,

45
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:51,480
but one in which I feel quite
comfortable and in which both some

46
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:54,090
Christians and some Buddhists would
consider me suspect.
