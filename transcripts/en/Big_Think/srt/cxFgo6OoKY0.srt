1
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,350
Possible.
And spas is a desperate desire to

2
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:18,010
understand the world better so that we
don't blow it up.

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,800
I mean,
that sounds rather simplistic,

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,830
but I start from the insight that most
versions of the way the world works,

5
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:35,200
that a highly [inaudible] of the sort
that one encounters in the social and

6
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,500
political sciences are wrong.
They don't capture anything like the

7
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:42,310
complexity of the historical process.
They're often actually deeply

8
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:44,710
misleading.
Like the democratic peace theory,

9
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,900
the theory that if all Paris were
democratic,

10
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:49,120
that would be no war because democracies
don't make war.

11
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:51,640
That there's an enormous literature on
this and most of it is rubbish.

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,180
It comes.
No in no way close to describing the

13
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:57,160
world.
A great deal of Ford has written about

14
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,540
the economic process is very good
applied mathematics that simply doesn't

15
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:05,200
describe this world.
It described another imaginary world of

16
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:08,500
perfect information,
the quiddity and a whole range of other

17
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:09,760
assumptions that don't pertain.

18
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,240
So my initial insight is this world is
highly complicated.

19
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:16,030
It works in very strange ways.
There are all kinds of,

20
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,880
uh,
nonlinearities which aren't captured by,

21
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,490
uh,
the simplifying models that social

22
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:25,600
scientists posit.
If we can understand the world better

23
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:28,360
and get a little closer to seeing,
uh,

24
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,260
how uncertain and complex it's workings
are,

25
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,710
then we may stand a chance of avoiding
the kinds of disaster that characterized

26
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:40,810
the 20th century.
I have studied 20th century disasters.

27
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:44,880
It's been one of my major interests.
I wrote about the German hyperinflation.

28
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,660
I wrote a book about the first World
War.

29
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,510
Then I wrote a book about the Second
World War.

30
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,470
I'm engaged in writing through my
biography of Kissinger,

31
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:55,330
a book about the Cold War.
Uh,

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,600
and that's a lot of death,
manmade death due to organize lethal

33
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,210
violence.
Uh,

34
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,010
and if you can work out why,
say between 118,

35
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:09,490
200 million people died,
violent desks and the 20th century.

36
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,140
And that shouldn't have happened,
right?

37
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:13,420
Because the 20th century,
it was supposed to be a century of

38
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,090
unparalleled economic and scientific
progress.

39
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,520
And it was,
and yet it was also a century in which

40
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:23,170
to horrendous violence occurred.
And that violence that emanated from

41
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:24,940
some of the most sophisticated
societies.

42
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,280
Figuring out why that happened seems
like a pretty important undertaking

43
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,470
though.
I certainly wouldn't put it up there

44
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:35,710
with finding a cure for cancer,
but it's what I do.

45
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,860
Uh,
and my hope is that each time I write a

46
00:02:38,861 --> 00:02:39,694
book,
I've,

47
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,840
I've had at least added some small
amount to or understanding of,

48
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,980
of what went wrong.
The other thing that motivates me is,

49
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,310
uh,
is an interesting,

50
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,530
the things that work because I'm a,
an economic historian first and

51
00:02:53,531 --> 00:02:56,110
foremost,
and particularly a financial historian.

52
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,030
I'm fascinated by the extraordinary
success capitalism as a way of

53
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,710
organizing economic activity.

54
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,120
I'm especially fascinated in the way
that financial systems have arisen in

55
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,670
certain places at certain times.
Uh,

56
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,170
and the benefits that they have
conferred in the sense that through a

57
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:17,920
good financial system,
you get resources better allocated than

58
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,800
in the absence of one.
Uh,

59
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,040
so another part of what I do is to try
and understand that better because when

60
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:27,010
we're not fighting wars where usually
caught up in the,

61
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,140
uh,
extraordinary ups and downs,

62
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,110
uh,
of financial markets and processes like

63
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,920
globalization but are not new,
we talk about them as if they're new,

64
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,550
but actually quite old,
go back to at least 1700.

65
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,830
Uh,
so these are the things that get me out

66
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:44,050
of bed in the morning.
I just want to understand that stuff

67
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:45,580
better.
Why the wars?

68
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,280
Why the stock market bubbles and busts,
uh,

69
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,600
in the hope that a historical approach
to these problems will actually yield

70
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,840
better insights than some of the other
approaches that people take.

71
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,270
[inaudible].
