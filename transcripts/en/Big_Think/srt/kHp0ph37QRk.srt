1
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,420
So your question is how widespread is it
with a NASA that scientists are

2
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:19,780
convinced that human activity is
responsible for climate change and this

3
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:21,280
is something that's important to say
very,

4
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:24,430
very clearly.
I have known and worked with hundreds of

5
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:27,190
earth scientists at many different
locations in NASA.

6
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,390
All of them,
all of them believe that human activity

7
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:35,290
is responsible for the current climate
change that we see going so fast.

8
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,930
It's almost unprecedented.
I want you to think about that.

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,490
One thing that I take really seriously
and I'm very proud of is that NASA is

10
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:45,880
not a political organization.
We are scientists that work for the

11
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:48,340
American people were funded by taxpayer
money,

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,580
and what we do is we make measurements.
We have many,

13
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:54,490
many different satellites that are
orbiting the earth right now.

14
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,880
They're looking at things like ice on
the oceans at the polls.

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,880
They're looking for things like
vegetation growth and the change of that

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,430
ocean level is the ocean level rising.
Yeah.

17
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:07,240
Turns out that it is.
So we have many scientists all over the

18
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:10,450
planet studying all of the different
ramifications of climate change.

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,350
We understand the causes.
There actually is no scientific

20
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:18,700
controversy about that.
Humans are releasing greenhouse gases

21
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:21,010
into the atmosphere and this is warming
our planet.

22
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,870
Now,
what scientists are researching

23
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:26,680
currently and they don't all agree about
is what are the most important

24
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:29,890
components of driving climate change?
Is it carbon dioxide?

25
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,770
It could it be something else like
methane and methane gets released.

26
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:34,930
That's an even more powerful greenhouse
gas.

27
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,980
We don't agree on how quickly things
like the ocean level will rise.

28
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,650
People have different estimates for how
quickly that will happen,

29
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,870
so there still is scientific controversy
about what the most important aspects of

30
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:49,810
climate change are and how quickly it
will go in the future,

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,550
but there is no scientific disagreement
with a NASA that humans are causing

32
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:55,384
climate change.

33
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,490
Now,
I started this off by saying that one of

34
00:01:57,491 --> 00:02:01,060
the things I'm very proud of is that
NASA is not political and what that

35
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:05,320
means for me is that I cannot advocate
for any specific solution to climate

36
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:06,730
change.
That's not my job.

37
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,300
That's up to policymakers.
The people might suggest things like

38
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:13,510
having more solar energy or cutting
carbon emissions or things like that,

39
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,740
but at Nasa we really understand that's
not us.

40
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,370
That's up to the American people are
leaders and leaders around the world.

41
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,520
What we do is provide the facts to
everybody on the planet.

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,910
All of our data is actually free to any
government,

43
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:30,430
any person,
any scientists all over the world that

44
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:33,580
wants to use it,
so we all know what's causing climate

45
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:36,040
change.
We can't tell you what to do about it,

46
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,830
but we can say it's time to do something
about it.
