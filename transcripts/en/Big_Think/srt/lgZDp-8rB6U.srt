1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,380
Hey,
deliberately developmental organization

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,530
is first of all a mouthful.
So we call it a Ddo for short.

3
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,920
And uh,
it's sort of an answer to the question.

4
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:22,750
If an organization's so valued
developing the capabilities of its

5
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:27,190
people that would want to create a
culture that could immersively gather

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,520
every member of that culture into an
ongoing developmental,

7
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:37,720
personal kind of learning journey,
what would that,

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,340
uh,
culture look like?

9
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:42,010
What would such an organization look
lark?

10
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:42,903
And,
uh,

11
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:48,330
that's what we set out to discover and
you know,

12
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:49,950
in the process,
uh,

13
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,680
what we learned is that in the ordinary
organization,

14
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,670
most people are doing a second job that
nobody's paying them for.

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,730
That second job has to do with looking
good,

16
00:01:00,731 --> 00:01:02,740
hiding their weaknesses,
uh,

17
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,030
covering their inadequacies,
managing other people's favorable

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,800
impressions of them.
And you can say that's a human nature.

19
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:12,490
But,
uh,

20
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,490
it also turns out to be incredibly
costly in ways that we don't think

21
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:19,234
enough about.

22
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,840
If I keep hiding my weaknesses,
the likelihood that I'm going to

23
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:24,800
overcome them,
uh,

24
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,240
shrinks to near zero.
And,

25
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,580
uh,
the organization has to keep,

26
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,410
essentially,
I'm paying for the consequences of my

27
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,810
limitations.
And,

28
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:40,330
uh,
they're paying me a full time salary for

29
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,500
part time work.
So imagine an organization where people

30
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:47,530
would feel safe enough that they would,
uh,

31
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,210
they would kind of consider they were
hired not because anybody thought they

32
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:54,820
were perfect,
but because people thought they were

33
00:01:54,821 --> 00:01:59,821
good and that they could learn and uh,
that one of their jobs there,

34
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,200
you know,
is uh,

35
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:07,180
to learn and uh,
where you get actually supported for,

36
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,220
you know,
revealing your mistakes.

37
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:12,940
And you could say the kind of,
there's kind of an entrepreneurial

38
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,330
stance toward people development.
You know,

39
00:02:16,331 --> 00:02:20,560
the watchword of entrepreneurial ism is
not to avoid failure,

40
00:02:20,561 --> 00:02:24,790
but to fail frequently at to fail fast
and to fail forward.

41
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:30,040
So imagine a culture where people were
encouraged to do that so that they

42
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,140
would,
I keep learning and getting better.

43
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:36,730
And then you would be imagining a Ddo,
a deliberately developmental

44
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,140
organization.
I think another really important feature

45
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,820
of these cultures that anyone would
quickly notice if you spent a little

46
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:50,821
time in them is a kind of transparency,
a way in which,

47
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,610
um,
people,

48
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,290
and often the way they'll say it is,
I am who I am at work.

49
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,650
Um,
I'm,

50
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,850
in other words,
they're not living a divided life.

51
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,080
This is what we mean by this notion that
an ordinary organizations,

52
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,980
we're all doing a second job.
We're trying to look good.

53
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,860
We're always trying to kind of be at our
best,

54
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,520
uh,
in these organizations.

55
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,430
Uh,
that quickly gets seen as a way of

56
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:32,050
essentially avoiding one of the most
precious and valuable things that the

57
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:37,030
culture has to offer you,
which is the opportunity to just be the

58
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:41,560
same person at work that you are when
you're not at work.

59
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,300
And that means,
you know,

60
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,770
the good,
the bad,

61
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:49,771
and what you might think is the ugly.
Bridgewater talks about this as a

62
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,080
radical transparency and uh,
that means that,

63
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,010
you know,
in the ordinary,

64
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,600
ordinary organization,
everybody agrees it's unprofessional to

65
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:06,430
talk critically about people behind
their backs and everybody participates

66
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:08,800
in it.
And some of you listening right now are

67
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:10,390
thinking,
I don't do that.

68
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,270
Okay.
You may not be a speaker,

69
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:18,330
but I bet you've been a listener to such
communications and you didn't say to the

70
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:21,400
other person,
I think it's unprofessional and wrong

71
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:25,060
for you to be talking about Ralph to be
behind his back.

72
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,970
So one way or the other passively or
actively,

73
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,180
we have all participated in what we know
to be unprofessional behavior

74
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:40,890
in bridgewater.
There is no back to be behind.

75
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,380
Why?
Uh,

76
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:49,210
because hold on to your hats.
In every office and in every meeting

77
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:52,240
room,
there's tape recording equipment and

78
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:54,550
every conversation is being tape
recorded.

79
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:00,030
Not in a creepy NSA a kind of way.
But if I'm having a conversation,

80
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,060
if,
if you report to me and I'm having a

81
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:11,650
conversation with you,
I haven't had the conversation about you

82
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,360
with my boss and you're not in the room.
So I've now been talking about you.

83
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,020
You don't have to fair through a 400
tapes and see if somebody mentioned your

84
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:24,790
name.
I have an obligation,

85
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,720
send you an email and let you know you
were discussed.

86
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,040
You know,
in this meeting,

87
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,710
you know,
at such and such a time on such and such

88
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:36,010
a day.
Feel free if you want to listen to the

89
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:39,580
tape.
So there's absolutely,

90
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:41,510
I know it drives people,
uh,

91
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,720
you know,
people get very struck,

92
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,920
you know,
by this.

93
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,690
But,
uh,

94
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,770
you know,
it's just one of a number of features

95
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:55,771
that quickly give you the sense we're
talking about a whole different way of

96
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,310
being at work.

97
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:02,380
Yeah.
