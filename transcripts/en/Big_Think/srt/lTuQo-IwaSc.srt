1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,390
When I first came to the Aspen ideas
festival,

2
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:14,710
I was very intimidated because most of
the people here have written a book.

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,130
They are an elected official.
Oh,

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,090
they're running a multinational
corporation.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,760
I spend much of my time in the
developing world,

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,760
in a mud hut where there's no running
water or electricity.

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,260
And I think what it's given me is to use
my own words is the,

8
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:32,910
as shown me the power within me.
And uh,

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,900
it has given me a voice and an
opportunity to be an advocate for those

10
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:42,400
people who really don't have an
opportunity to share their story.

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,490
And there are very few of the
individuals here,

12
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:48,670
as much as they have traveled and they
have been to the developing world,

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,600
they haven't had an opportunity really
to experience through the eyes of the

14
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:56,560
people who live there.
So what I value about this is that it's

15
00:00:56,561 --> 00:01:00,940
given me an opportunity to share with
them and they are the policy makers.

16
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,180
And my hope is that I've been able to
maybe shape or influence them in such a

17
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:11,500
way that they're able to leave having a
better understanding of the people that

18
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:12,520
they touch.
