1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,500
I've always done writing as part of
everything that I've done in the past.

2
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:12,380
Just various creative enterprises.
I write songs and do music and uh,

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,660
write essays and short plays and sketch
comedy and all these things.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,820
And there during my twenties,
I was living in Chicago and probably

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,350
pursuing everything creatively that I
can think of all at once and waiting for

6
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:30,700
something to choose me.
Um,

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,060
I got a job right out of graduate school
working for a local television show in,

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,150
in Chicago.
And so I was doing writing for that,

9
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:42,180
but I was also writing music and I was
doing a little bit of performing.

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,560
Um,
uh,

11
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,090
I was writing plays and,
and also performing on stage and doing

12
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:51,210
the music thing and playing coffee
houses and Blues Clubs.

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,300
Um,
and ultimately,

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,880
uh,
I was just waiting for something to

15
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:59,250
choose me.
And what happened was somebody

16
00:00:59,251 --> 00:00:59,941
suggested,
well,

17
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:01,800
why don't you write a screenplay for a
movie?

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,791
And I thought,
well,

19
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,220
I like movies.
And so I wrote one and,

20
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,740
and I looked at it and said,
that was fun.

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,230
Um,
I didn't like that particular screen

22
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:11,520
plane,
didn't do anything with it,

23
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:16,500
but then I wrote another one and send it
out and somebody bought it and all of a

24
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:18,660
sudden I was a screenwriter and I
thought that was easy.

25
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,670
I'll do this.
Um,

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,690
and so I just kept doing it and I
haven't had any reason to do anything

27
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:25,524
else since.

28
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,990
Good.
That good part.

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,230
Writing a screenplay is not so hard.
That's all about knowing where the

30
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:38,100
margins are.
Fighting a good screenplay is almost

31
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:43,101
impossible.
I think it's part of,

32
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:44,700
it has to do with,
um,

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,330
being original,
trying to do something that feels fresh

34
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,770
when there've been so many movies made
and,

35
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,810
and also particularly in Hollywood,
a tendency to try and remake the same

36
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:58,740
movies over and over again.
So it's writing a movie that's original,

37
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,780
um,
that becomes really difficult.

38
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,390
Uh,
and

39
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,540
there's something very formal about the
enterprise of writing a screenplay.

40
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:12,420
It can't be longer than two hours.
Um,

41
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,940
so the kind of story you tell,
whatever it is,

42
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:19,941
it has to be as engaging and as exciting
as possible within that one and a half

43
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:23,850
to two hour period.
And that forces certain kinds of

44
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:27,150
conventions on you or places where,
oh,

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,800
we really want to have them gripped in
the story by here or else they're going

46
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:34,350
to leave or change the channel or,
or walk out of the theater.

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,950
Um,
there's a certain kind of efficiency

48
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,610
built into screenwriting that's,
that's very elegant,

49
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,940
but that makes it as hard to craft as a
very finely crafted piece of sculpture

50
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,590
or furniture or something like that.
Uh,

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,500
um,
and,

52
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:56,610
and making it all come alive when you
just start putting together all the

53
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:59,340
pieces of things that you visualize,
that would be wonderful.

54
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,110
Um,
it all seems in your mind to be

55
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:03,190
wonderful.
But then what,

56
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:05,050
when you look at what you've created on
the page,

57
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,750
it's like a Frankenstein's monster.
You've got a head,

58
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:09,230
you've got the hands,
you've got the feet,

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,320
you've got the body,
you thought of everything.

60
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:14,530
And when you look at it and it's still
just a bunch of dead meat lion there on

61
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:18,280
the table and you're trying to get a
pulse to go through the thing,

62
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,920
what makes it real?
It's a complete artifice.

63
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,070
It's completely made up.
It's all these things from your head and

64
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:26,290
your desires and dreams and you know,
it,

65
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:31,291
it isn't real yet.
And somehow something has to spark off

66
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:35,560
the page that makes you to,
to join the life that's going on in this

67
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:40,510
world that you've created.
And to make that smooth life feel real

68
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,150
when the whole thing is artifice.
It all has agenda.

69
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:46,030
It's all people you've created and
worlds that don't even exist.

70
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,550
Um,
making that feel real,

71
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:51,040
that's,
that's the absolute impossible thing.

72
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,830
Being original,
making it feel real and making it all

73
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:54,970
fit.
Uh,

74
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,880
it's,
it's the easiest thing in the world and

75
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:59,170
it's absolutely impossible.

76
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,920
Um,
a screenwriting is an art form,

77
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:08,260
but it's also a craft.
It's both of those things.

78
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:10,220
It's a commercial art.
Um,

79
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,480
um,
and both of those things you need to be

80
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:14,270
good at.
I,

81
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,720
uh,
if you just know the craft and you don't

82
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:19,720
have any sense of the art,
that means you don't have anything to

83
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:21,670
say.
And you don't have an interesting way to

84
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:24,940
say it.
If it's all art and no craft,

85
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,450
then you've got these great ideas,
but you aren't able to articulate them

86
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,480
in a way that makes it all work out as a
good blueprint for building a great

87
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:37,450
movie.
So I definitely think there's,

88
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:39,250
there's a great deal of artistry
involved.

89
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:42,100
I've never seen a good screenplay that
was nothing but craft.
