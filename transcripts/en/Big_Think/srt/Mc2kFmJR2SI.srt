1
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,530
Chooses amongst self replicating
entities.

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,990
Those self replicating entities have
some kind of power over that probability

3
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:22,380
of being copied,
of being replicated to being passed on.

4
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,980
In practice,
that almost always means choosing

5
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:30,981
between alternative DNA genes.
So it's about the natural selection,

6
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,830
the disproportionate,
it's about the unequal survival of genes

7
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,610
through generations that is not for
selection.

8
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,280
We see it in the form of changes in
phenotypes.

9
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:48,480
That's to say changes in bodies because
it's through the changes in the bodies

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,370
that the genes induce,
that they ensure their survival or fail

11
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:55,700
to survive.
The ones that are good at surviving are

12
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,520
the ones that are good at building
bodies that are good at surviving and

13
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,730
reproducing.
Where gene machines in the sense that

14
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:09,981
her body is constructed by genes that
have been successful in surviving in the

15
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:12,930
past.
They're good at surviving because

16
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:16,410
they're good at constructing machines in
which they survive.

17
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,620
So our body is a machine for the
propagation of the genes that built it.
