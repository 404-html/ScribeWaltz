1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,510
I don't know about alcohol and
creativity.

2
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:14,670
I think,
uh,

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,150
you know,
I think that the,

4
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,170
the classic idea that,
oh,

5
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:23,580
look,
all these artists,

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,070
these great artists and great writers
drank a lot,

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,700
therefore I better drink a lot.
Uh,

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,461
I,
you know,

9
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:31,290
I think that probably has,
you know,

10
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:31,910
that,
that,

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,840
that desire to embrace,
uh,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,460
um,
the,

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,480
the ID souped up on alcohol is probably
a lead.

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,120
People astray more than it's helped
them.

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,220
Um,
you know,

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,510
but,
you know,

17
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:50,300
I certainly am not going to tell people
they should,

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,730
they should be teetotallers are never
smoked pot or never take drugs,

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,020
you know.
Uh,

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,470
I have,
I have taken drugs and smoke pot and

21
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:00,060
drunk too much,
uh,

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,950
in my life.
Has it made,

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,990
has it helped my creativity?
No,

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,340
but,
uh,

25
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:06,630
I think,
you know,

26
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,710
life has no life must be lived,
uh,

27
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,460
in all of it with all of its bumps and
ups and downs and,

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,353
and,
and,

29
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,590
but in the end,
you know,

30
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:24,591
you need to be clearheaded enough to
actually do the work and the work of,

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,370
of the creative work.
It seems to me,

32
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,330
uh,
is in the doing of it is not very

33
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:36,120
enhanced by being drunk or being stoned.
