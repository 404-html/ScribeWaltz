1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,500
[inaudible]

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,850
for someone like me who's written a book
advocating what openly is an idea,

3
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:15,160
what sticks sounding version of foreign
policy.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,550
It's a very hard time.
Uh,

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,440
I think for a bunch of different
reasons.

6
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:25,441
One is that eight years of the Bush
administration has not only exhausted

7
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:32,310
the larger world with this visionary
sweeping language and behavior and

8
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:35,800
foreign policy,
but the American people as well.

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,220
And so I think that there is a deep mood
of retrenchment,

10
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,750
uh,
in this country that is a wish,

11
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:46,720
not so much for different foreign policy
though there is that,

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,500
but also for less,
no grand adventures,

13
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:55,501
no grandiose language,
no talking about the universal

14
00:00:55,931 --> 00:01:00,700
projection of American ideals.
Then you add to that the economic

15
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:04,150
crisis,
which not only means that foreign policy

16
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:06,640
is less salient than people would have
thought it would be,

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,000
would have been a couple months ago,
but also there's less money to spend on

18
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:12,340
things that otherwise you might
profitably spend money on.

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,440
It is true and it is a rebuke to the
great ambitions of bushes,

20
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:19,540
freedom agenda,
that in fact,

21
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,290
in recent years,
the growth of freedom has been either

22
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,680
nail or or negative.
When you measure it this way.

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,060
At the same time,
I would be cautious about saying there

24
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:33,850
is this concerted negative trend that
is,

25
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,420
we're talking about a relatively small
number of countries and it's a,

26
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:42,421
it's an index that shifts up and down.
You can certainly say there was no sign

27
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,160
of that democracy is growing in the
world,

28
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:49,510
but I don't think,
I think that would exaggerate the

29
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:54,511
ability of the United States to alter
things that are quite profound and

30
00:01:55,751 --> 00:02:00,190
deeply rooted in their locality.
To think that just because George Bush

31
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:03,550
screwed up,
therefore the freedom is actually

32
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:08,551
heading into a nosedive.
