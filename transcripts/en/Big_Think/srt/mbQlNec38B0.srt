1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,553
Yeah,

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,950
as important as it is to cross
disciplines to transgress boundaries,

3
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:15,230
whether it's science and art or even
boundaries within science,

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,420
it is very tough to do in practice.
It is very tough to interact with

5
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:23,390
someone who speaks a different language,
who uses different acronyms,

6
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:25,400
who had tax problems from different
perspectives.

7
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,000
So I think we have to do everything
possible to not only encourage this to

8
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:31,120
give out more grants that funded,
uh,

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,340
funding is of course a huge,
huge problem for interdisciplinary

10
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:35,580
research.
Um,

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,420
but also I think begin to make a
serious,

12
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:40,340
rigorous case for these kinds of
interactions.

13
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:43,360
I think too often it's easy to write off
interdisciplinary collaborations is kind

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,090
of feel good exercises when I think the
research and literature may clear that

15
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:49,370
there's often a really,
really,

16
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:53,510
if not the most productive way of coming
together way of collaborating.

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,920
And in a sense we see the most when we
are on the outside of a field looking

18
00:00:57,921 --> 00:00:59,900
in,
when my favorite examples of this is the

19
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:04,400
website innocentive.com which is,
it's a crowdsourcing website used by

20
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:06,110
various fortune 100 companies.

21
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,240
So Eli Lilly helped develop it.
But you know,

22
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,530
Pfizer uses it.
Proctor and gamble uses the General

23
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,720
Electric Kraft foods companies with
huge,

24
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,120
huge r and d budgets and the billions of
dollars,

25
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,150
but they do is they post their hardest
scientific problems on this website.

26
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:23,930
The problems their own scientists can
solve and they catch a reward to it.

27
00:01:23,931 --> 00:01:26,870
So if you can solve a problem for g a
chemistry problem,

28
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:30,740
say maybe you'll get $1 million,
maybe it will be $50,000 who knows?

29
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:31,574
But,
but you know,

30
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,980
that's the incentive part of incentive.
Now,

31
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:37,160
the first surprisingly about [inaudible]
dot com is that it works about anywhere

32
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:40,940
between 30 to 50% of these problems are
solved within six months.

33
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,490
Some are solved within days of being
posted online.

34
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,320
So I mean,
this is kind of surprising,

35
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:47,180
I think,
because here problems that these huge

36
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:51,020
companies can solve and yet some
stranger sitting on his couch in his

37
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:53,540
pajamas while eating fruit loops is
solving them,

38
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:55,100
making it look easy.

39
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,070
Now what's most interesting but
incentives,

40
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,570
how these problems get solved.
And this is work by cream and Connie at

41
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:03,170
Harvard business school,
he is shown that let's say ge posted

42
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:07,280
chemistry problem online.
Then prom is almost never solved by

43
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:09,530
another chemist.
Instead it's all biomolecular molecular

44
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:13,580
biologist by biophysicists,
by someone who knows enough to

45
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:16,940
understand the terms of the question but
doesn't know so much that they run into

46
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:20,030
the exact same stumbling blocks as the
chemist back at Ge.

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,600
So this is a real testament to the
virtues of outsider thinking and

48
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,990
outsider creativity.
And I think we have to realize that this

49
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:28,970
is,
this is a real thing that we have to

50
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:30,690
incorporate in,
you know,

51
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,030
in you know,
in everyday work,

52
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,930
you know,
in the everyday world.

53
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:36,620
Cause I think we come with this tacit
assumption that if you're struggling

54
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:39,500
with a really hard problem,
you got to give to the guy who knows the

55
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:43,850
most to those expert insiders.
But sometimes when it comes to

56
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:46,620
creativity and innovation,
sometimes knowledge is a blind spot.

57
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:49,970
Sometimes we can know too much,
sometimes we have our best thoughts when

58
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:52,550
we're working with someone.
In a different field,

59
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,210
tackling a problem just beyond our area
of expertise.

60
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,560
Um,
so I think that's,

61
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,650
that's a very practical case for
interdisciplinary collaboration.

62
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:03,440
Okay.
