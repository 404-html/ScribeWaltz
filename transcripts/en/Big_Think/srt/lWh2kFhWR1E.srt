1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,910
When people entertain at home,
the biggest mistake they make is kind of

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,370
overreaching.
They try to do too much.

3
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:18,270
They try to make the bread and then they
make the cream spinach and then they

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,730
make the roast beef,
you know,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,120
and then they've got to make the,
the red velvet cake for dessert.

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,310
You don't need to do all of that.
I think,

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,720
you know,
green salads,

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,540
you know,
you buy some green salads at the green

9
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:34,800
marker and throw some goat cheese and
some grape tomatoes and that's your side

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,960
dish.
You put a roast in the oven and that's

11
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:38,280
your entree,
you know,

12
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:43,281
and maybe you buy a beautiful pancake
and put some elaborate sorbet that you

13
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:46,110
bought.
I mean you need to keep it simple.

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,480
You want to have a good time,
you don't want to be frazzled.

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,580
This is about having a good time,
you know,

16
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:53,190
and people are just so happy to be
invited into your home.

17
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:54,870
And,
and you know,

18
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:56,850
it should not be a hassle for you.
It,

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,450
it be something that you really look
forward to doing and you show off.

20
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:03,030
Maybe one dish you make one thing that's
fancy.
