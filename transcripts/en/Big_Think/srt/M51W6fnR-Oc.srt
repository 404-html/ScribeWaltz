1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,970
There's a sort of a funny saying which
is that whenever people are are free to

2
00:00:09,971 --> 00:00:12,910
choose anything they want,
they usually choose what their friends

3
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:16,210
have chosen.
This mimicry that we humans events is

4
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:18,310
extremely fundamental.
Therefore,

5
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:20,860
networks provide us a kind of
mathematical,

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,100
social and biological tool to understand
the kind of fundamental basis for this

7
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:31,270
mimicry because you copy the people to
whom you are connected primarily and

8
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:35,260
you'll come to copy them along the whole
variety of traits in the workplace.

9
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:39,640
These traits might include things like
how energized you are at work or a how

10
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:43,600
innovative you are at work or how
cooperative you are at work or whether

11
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:46,120
you smoke or not.
Our other health traits,

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,870
all of these desirable properties,
your productivity,

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,850
your innovativeness,
your cooperativeness,

14
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:56,650
your health come to depend upon the like
attributes in individuals to whom you're

15
00:00:56,651 --> 00:01:00,490
connected.
Our group and other groups have mapped

16
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,330
networks in the workplace,
have come to understand how people are

17
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:08,110
connected to each other and have used
that understanding as a kind of

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,320
mechanism or tool and opportunity for
intervention in order to call forth from

19
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,370
people.

20
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,160
I'm better behavior if you will.
More cooperativeness,

21
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,790
more innovativeness,
a more um,

22
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,440
collaborativeness and better health
behaviors.

23
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,330
The usual way of understanding workplace
organization is the classic Org Chart

24
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:30,820
where you have boxes and names and it's
like a tree,

25
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,730
um,
but actually the real work or the

26
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,220
reorganization of a workplace looks
nothing like that.

27
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,200
It's the way people interact with each
other.

28
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:41,710
It's a more jumble of ties.
It looks more like a jumble of Christmas

29
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:43,960
tree lights.
So if you can think of a network as

30
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,480
every note,
every person is a little light and the

31
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,180
wires connecting them are the ties
between them.

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,390
And when you take out a jumble of
Christmas tree lights and you put it on

33
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:55,600
the floor and look at it actually,
that's what workplace networks really

34
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:57,760
look like.
Once you understand those patterns of

35
00:01:57,761 --> 00:02:00,370
interactions,
you can begin to understand how people

36
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,460
influence each other with respect to
health and health behaviors in the

37
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:04,270
workplace.

38
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,840
And once you understand that pattern of
interactions and that pattern of

39
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:10,000
influence,
you can begin to think about ways of

40
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:11,560
intervening in it.
For example,

41
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:15,530
you can identify influential individuals
within the network and target them with,

42
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,630
with health.
Um,

43
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,460
interventions or you can identify ways
to get groups of people to sign up for

44
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:23,650
interventions and we know that when
groups of people,

45
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:27,940
particularly people who know each other
and are interconnected collaboratively

46
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:31,870
engage in something such as a health
improvement behavior,

47
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,290
that they're more likely to sustain it
and more likely to respond positively.

48
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,050
So once you understand the structure of
human interactions,

49
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,770
it opens up all kinds of new vistas,
new ways that you can intervene.
