1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Presuasion is the process of arranging
for an audience to agree with your

2
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:14,690
message before they encounter it.
Now,

3
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:17,420
that might sound like some form of
magic,

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,540
but it's not.
It's established science.

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,770
Very often we can use priests,
waist live tactics,

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,800
even other kinds of influence tactics on
ourselves to increase the likelihood

7
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:34,130
that we will reach our goals,
that we will obtain the outcomes that we

8
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:37,040
hope for in a particular situation.
There's research,

9
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:42,041
for example,
to show that if you depict for people an

10
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,370
image of a runner winning a race,
they become more achievement oriented

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,280
and actually achieved their goal to a
greater extent while that runner is in

12
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:57,590
the background.
There's another piece of research,

13
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:02,591
a followup research that shows that if
you depict for people an image of

14
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,790
Rodin's,
the thinker,

15
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:09,170
you know that the statute,
they become more analytic and

16
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:13,310
deliberative and they're more likely to
solve problems,

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,360
difficult,
complex problems that they're faced

18
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:17,810
with.

19
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,090
So this is something we can do to
ourselves.

20
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,800
If we have a task that requires a lot of
energy and motivation.

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,340
Put a picture of a runner winning a race
in the corner of your computer screen

22
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,090
where you will see that cue there while
you're performing the task.

23
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:40,300
If you're analyzing a budget perhaps or
developing some plan that requires a lot

24
00:01:41,661 --> 00:01:46,661
of strategic thinking,
put a picture of the thinker there and

25
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:51,770
you're more likely to achieve that
particular goal.

26
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,830
The thing is we get to control the cues
in our environment that send us in

27
00:01:57,381 --> 00:02:02,381
directions that are likely to be
successful for the particular task we

28
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:07,571
have at hand.
When writing my book presuasion,

29
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,710
I dedicated it to my grandchildren and
there was something I did for myself to

30
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:22,301
pre swayed me to make that the best
possible book I could develop and

31
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:28,760
produce.
It was to put the following image in my

32
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:33,530
mind of each of my grandchildren who are
young right now.

33
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,430
Here's the image.
When they're old enough to read it,

34
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,270
I've left a copy with their parents for
each of them,

35
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,950
and I want their parents to give them
the book and say,

36
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,420
you see this?
This book was dedicated to you.

37
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,370
Will it better be a good book?
It better be the highest quality book I

38
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:03,700
can arrange,
and so while I was writing that book,

39
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,660
there was a corner,
there was a coroner,

40
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,760
photograph of my grandkids on the screen
of my computer.

41
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,690
That picture kept me focused on quality.
No short cuts allowed.

42
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:25,090
This is for my grandkids.
It better be the best book I can

43
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,420
possibly generate.
When I first started investigating the

44
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,400
influence process,
I actually became a spy of sorts.

45
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,790
I went undercover to all of the major
professions of our society dedicated to

46
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:47,980
getting us to say yes and I took
training.

47
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:52,630
I enrolled in the training programs of
salespeople,

48
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,540
fundraisers,
recruiters,

49
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,660
public relations specialists and so on
to see what were the techniques that

50
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:06,391
we're working most
widely across the range,

51
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:14,140
the broadest range of these influence
strategies of these influence approaches

52
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,520
and what.

53
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,520
What I found was interesting in that
there was a particular kind of

54
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:27,151
practitioner within those influenced
professions who rose to the top.

55
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Almost invariably.
It wasn't the individual who spent most

56
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,440
of his or her time crafting the message
that they sent.

57
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,930
Although that was important to them.
It was that they crafted what they said

58
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,630
and did immediately before they
delivered their message.

59
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,930
That was the differentiator between the
average scores and the aces of each

60
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:04,720
profession.
Those people who were the highest

61
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,950
achievers were priests,
waders,

62
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,890
they,
they acted like expert gardeners.

63
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:16,891
They knew that it didn't matter how good
this seed that you had might be if you

64
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:24,961
didn't prepare the earth for it first,
it wasn't going to bear fullest fruit.

65
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,220
So they cultivated the earth.
They,

66
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,570
they,
they pretreated the ground,

67
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:37,720
and before they planted their seed with
their message,

68
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,990
they did something that caused the
recipients of their message to have a

69
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:49,921
positive state of mind before they
encountered the message itself.

70
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,170
The interesting question is,
how do you go about cultivating the

71
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:59,570
earth?
How do you arrange for people to be in a

72
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,580
frame of mind that is conducive to the,
uh,

73
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,940
the message that you wanted to send?
Um,

74
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,740
it is to recognize,
first of all,

75
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,830
what is the central element of your
message?

76
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,410
What is the feature of your message that
would make it most wise for people to

77
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,100
accept your offer?
Right?

78
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:34,030
And then you take that dimension and go
to the moment before you deliver your

79
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:40,271
message and give draw people's attention
to that idea,

80
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:43,430
to that dimension.
Let me give you an example.

81
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,180
There was a study done by an online
furniture store.

82
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,870
They had a furniture that was
comfortable.

83
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,730
They also had lower and furniture that
was attractive because it was

84
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,790
inexpensive and they did an experiment.
They send half of the visitors to their

85
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:09,731
site to a background depiction of clouds
on the landing page of a wallpaper of

86
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:18,420
their site.

87
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,910
So the landing page had fluffy clouds on
the back background.

88
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:28,450
Those people read it comfort as the most
important factor in buying a sofa.

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They spent more time searching for
comfort related information inside the

90
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:47,471
site and they preferred comfortable
furniture to purchase.

91
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,890
The other half of the visitors were sent
to a site that had as its background,

92
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:58,670
wallpaper,
pennies,

93
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,800
coins,
money,

94
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,260
right?
Those people rated cost as the most

95
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:10,340
important feature for them for
purchasing a sofa.

96
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,640
They searched for price related
information and they purchased more

97
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,820
inexpensive furniture.
They preferred to purchase more

98
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:24,821
inexpensive furniture as a consequence.
So you can see that what was the central

99
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,520
dimension of the message,
it could be comfort or it could be cost,

100
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,580
could be installed in a customer's mind
ahead of time,

101
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,170
which caused them to see that dimension
as more important,

102
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,380
to search for information relative to it
and to act on the basis of a product

103
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:56,940
that gave them that dimension in a
prioritized way.

104
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,520
It could be cost,
it could be clouds.

105
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,950
Here was the interesting thing about
that study.

106
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:06,951
For me,
almost no one recognized that they had

107
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:10,950
been influenced by the background
wallpaper.

108
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,910
It flew under the radar.
That means that this is something that's

109
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:23,421
not only powerful,
it's also something that we have to deal

110
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:28,440
with in a as as as communicators in an
ethical way,

111
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,120
because we've got some things that are
going to move people in our direction

112
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:38,270
without them even recognizing or taking
into account that we're moving them in

113
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:39,090
their,
in,

114
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,010
in their direction,
in our direction.
