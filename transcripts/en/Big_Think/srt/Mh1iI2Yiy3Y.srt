1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,190
As a poker player,
you,

2
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:14,180
you can't have a consistent style and be
successful over time.

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,720
Uh,
your opponents come to know how you play

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,470
and they will devise a strategy to beat
you if there are any good.

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,550
So while you can have over overarching
tendencies,

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,980
um,
you,

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,160
you really can't stick with one way to
play and be successful.

8
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:32,990
And I think that's pretty much the same
for business.

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,330
It's either evolve or die.
Um,

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,700
and you,
your strategy at the poker table and in

11
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:41,480
tournaments has to evolve over time
depending on the circumstances in that

12
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:43,580
tournament.
And your strategy in business has to

13
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:46,400
evolve.
Your competitors are always trying to

14
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:48,590
get the best of you.
And if you don't,

15
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:51,590
uh,
take advantage of holes that they open

16
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:55,370
up or holes that they attempt to close,
then you can be pretty sure that your

17
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:58,520
business isn't going to last very long.
Same thing at the poker table.

18
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,350
What a strategy that may be working
perfectly in the early stages of the

19
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:05,510
tournament,
maybe suicide in the middle stages of

20
00:01:05,511 --> 00:01:07,090
the tournament.
And a,

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,100
you always have to be both a aware of
your image at the table and,

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,930
uh,
and what's your opponent's think of you

23
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:19,130
and,
and then try to constantly rearrange

24
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:21,930
your strategy so that they are doing the
wrong thing against you at the right.

25
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:21,980
Yeah.
