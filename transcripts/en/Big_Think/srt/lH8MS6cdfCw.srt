1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,513
Mm,

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,640
turkeys are a tough animal to cook
poetry in general,

3
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:09,100
and it's because there are two types of
muscle in Turkey,

4
00:00:09,101 --> 00:00:12,640
there's the breast meat and the meat.
So a fast twitch muscle,

5
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:13,530
that's the breast meat.
Uh,

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,540
that's the muscle that's used for a
fight or flight.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,880
The adrenaline,
the ones that the muscles at the Turkey

8
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:20,620
doesn't use very often during its
lifetime.

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,020
Then there's the slow twitch muscle,
which are the legs,

10
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:25,300
that dark meat.
I'm slow twitch muscle has a lot more

11
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:28,240
connective tissue in it,
so it needs to be cooked to a higher

12
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:31,090
temperature in order to make sure that
that connective tissue breaks down.

13
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:32,860
So typically when you're roasting a
Turkey,

14
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:36,160
you want the breast meat to come to
around 150 degrees or so,

15
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,290
and you want the leg meat to come to
around at least 165 to 175 degrees.

16
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,780
So.
So the issue is the same bird to

17
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:44,500
different temperatures.

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,810
How do you do that?
The way people typically cook a Turkey

19
00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:48,100
is,
they'll put it in a roasting pan,

20
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:50,260
like in Iraq with a roasting pan,
was kind of high sides.

21
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:53,770
And that's actually the worst way you
can possibly cook a Turkey because that

22
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:56,140
roasting pan is heavy metal,
it has these high sides,

23
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:58,210
that kind of shield the bottom of the
bird,

24
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,880
which is where the legs are,
it shields it from the heat of the oven.

25
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,780
So your breast ends up overcooking far
before your legs are done.

26
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:06,600
Um,
and that's why so many people have dry

27
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:10,240
Turkey breast meat on thanksgiving,
the easiest way to deal with this

28
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:11,700
problem,
and there are all sorts of tricks.

29
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:15,070
I'm like flipping the bird upside down.
I'm turning it while it's in the oven,

30
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,560
icing down the breast.
They're separating it into parts.

31
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,510
I find the easiest way to do it is to a
butterfly to spatchcock the bird.

32
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,460
So you can,
you can either do that yourself with a

33
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:26,680
pair of poultry shears or you can ask
your butcher to do it for you.

34
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,600
Um,
and the idea is you cut out the backbone

35
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:31,420
of the bird and then you kind of splay
its legs out in this kind of

36
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,080
pornographic way,
um,

37
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,140
and uh,
and press down on the breasts so that

38
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,630
the whole Turkey lies flat with all of
the skin on top.

39
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:41,260
And what you end up with there is,
you'll find that the breast then becomes

40
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:43,090
sort of the biggest,
thickest part of the,

41
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:43,631
of,
of the,

42
00:01:43,631 --> 00:01:44,261
uh,
the Turkey.

43
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:47,170
While the legs lie a little bit flatter,
the legs are exposed to more heat.

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,930
The breast gets a little bit less heat
that he goes into a little bit more

45
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:53,830
slowly because it's so thick.
And so naturally it ends up cooking

46
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:54,250
perfectly.

47
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,650
By the time your breast meat hits 150
degrees in the center,

48
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,920
your legs are like one 75.
All the meat comes out perfectly.

49
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:02,500
I'm using this method.
You can also cook a much higher heat and

50
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,560
cook much faster so you can,
you can cook a 12 pound Turkey in like

51
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,830
45 minutes to an hour using this,
which is about half the time it takes to

52
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:10,250
cook a traditional Turkey.
Um,

53
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,030
and then finally it also has all the,
all that skin,

54
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,440
all the skin gets exposed to the heat of
the oven so you get really nice crispy

55
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:20,170
brown skin.
So the only disadvantage to it is that,

56
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:23,260
um,
it ends up looking like a,

57
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,660
like a legs spread apart Turkey when you
bring it to the table.

58
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:28,240
But I always carve it in the,
in the kitchen in Britain and serve it

59
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:29,080
anyway.
And plus,

60
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:30,970
you know,
I would take good tasting Turkey over

61
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:32,470
great looking Turkey any day.
