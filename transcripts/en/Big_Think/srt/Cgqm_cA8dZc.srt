1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,270
Well,
I grew up,

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,400
I was born nearly 60 years ago,
so I was a child of the 60s,

3
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:19,690
basically,
which sort of a rough blank.

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,780
Uh,
I really started growing up,

5
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:26,140
I think in the 70s.
I went to lab rock kid,

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,280
but Dublin,
Ireland in them days,

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,200
it was a very dark place as in it was a
very poor almost toward the world.

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,950
Uh,
we are going through economically,

9
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:43,210
the whole world is going through a
recession at the moment while baby,

10
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,260
the 60s,
the 70s and the 80s in Ireland was a

11
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:50,350
real recession.
It wasn't a pleasant place,

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,060
was massive unemployment.
We had huge political problems with the

13
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:56,550
north.
Uh,

14
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,570
it was dull and gray.
And so I formed a band and tried to

15
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:05,140
escape it all.
So it's a great country,

16
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:06,970
a really beautiful,
great country,

17
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,270
but it's had its troubles.
And the last 15 years we had one of the

18
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:15,130
biggest economic booms,
we,

19
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:20,080
we became overnight.
We became almost the wealthiest country

20
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:24,850
in Europe.
And last year the bubble burst.

21
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,180
But I think a few bubbles of Burston a
few countries.

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,430
So we're all going through the same
thing.

23
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:35,431
So,
but let's say Ireland in the 70s and the

24
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,880
80s.
It was tough.

25
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,750
But if you grow up with a tough
background,

26
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,280
like she's strong.

27
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,810
One of the biggest problems I find
with Irish politics and the economic

28
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:56,060
thing was after,
after the war,

29
00:01:56,061 --> 00:02:00,920
after World War Two,
most of the European countries started

30
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:05,270
to develop economically and socially.
But whatever way,

31
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:08,980
the Catholic church,
they took a grip and they almost go over

32
00:02:08,981 --> 00:02:10,610
into the country.
I mean,

33
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:15,611
we were almost like a dictatorship at
there's good and bad and,

34
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,450
but we experienced an awful lot of bad,
uh,

35
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,280
especially from the institutions that
taught children to Christian brothers

36
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:28,640
and Cetera.
And all those stories are all coming out

37
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,190
now,
not just in Ireland and in Canada,

38
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:35,360
all over the world.
So it was pretty intense.

39
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,570
It was that
the Catholic church,

40
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:41,780
we're almost there.
We're like our Edgar j hoover,

41
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,000
if you know what I mean.
They ruled the roost,

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,680
but it had a huge,
profound influence on me in that as you

43
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:54,380
get older,
you realize that you can't blame

44
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:57,800
everything,
but there's good and bad and things get

45
00:02:57,801 --> 00:03:01,900
missed directed.
So I would call myself a black Catholic.

46
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,320
You know,
I still have this attraction to it

47
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,560
because all religions I'm not a fan of.
I'm a fan of sort of belief and

48
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:14,380
spirituality.
So I would be,

49
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,770
I would be into Christ rather than the
Catholics.

50
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,020
I was a very shy child.
Uh,

51
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,490
I didn't like football.
I didn't like the usual stuff that was

52
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:30,100
shoved,
that sports were always shoved down yet.

53
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,690
And the Gaelic language,
which I've actually disliked as a kid.

54
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,623
But,
um,

55
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,550
as I grow up,
I quite like it.

56
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:44,551
My real name isn't Gavin.
I was given Gavin Friday by my friends.

57
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,220
I,
I'm Christen phenomena and the V,

58
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,560
which is Gaelic and there's no actual
English translation and I hated it as a

59
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:54,480
kid.
But as I,

60
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,810
as I grow up,
I said,

61
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:57,100
I went,
no,

62
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:01,390
I like it.
My main influences were I loved,

63
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:02,950
I loved art.
I mean,

64
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,250
it sounds a little pretentious to say I
was into art,

65
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:10,330
but I like drawing.
I liked music.

66
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,540
Music was my outlet from day one.
You know,

67
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:18,280
I was giving you an image of,
of Ireland being this dull,

68
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,710
gray,
massive unemployment.

69
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:25,420
And not much going on.
And the future was the Dole Q,

70
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,980
uh,
or,

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
uh,
for me the window of hope was music and

72
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:37,720
books.
So I fell in love with sort of t rex and

73
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:39,190
David Bowie,
very young.

74
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,020
And they sort of said,
hey,

75
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:45,460
you don't have to live in this
north side of Dublin.

76
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:50,140
That's all gray and depressed.
You can be a spider and go to Mars.

77
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:51,963
So,
uh,

78
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,240
music,
uh,

79
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,740
I'm books too.
I read avidly as a kid.

80
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,140
So,
and that's the beautiful thing about

81
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:03,880
books and music and,
and even movies is that you can actually

82
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:04,930
escape.
You can,

83
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,790
you can go into other worlds.

84
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,970
It's village was an imaginary place
really.

85
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,410
It was the group of young guys that grew
up around the same area.

86
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,910
I grew up on a street called Cedar Wood
Road.

87
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,940
Um,
and by coincidence,

88
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,810
my best friends that around the age of
10 became at a guide called Bano.

89
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,490
And another guy called Googie.
Uh,

90
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,980
and we just,
it was music again,

91
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,240
if I thought that that pulled us
together.

92
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:47,740
I lived in at the bottom end of the
street and they lived at the top end and

93
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,800
I was quite shy as a little kid.
Uh,

94
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,550
but they find me quite interesting cause
I had the right albums underneath my

95
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:55,510
arm.
You know,

96
00:05:55,511 --> 00:06:00,511
those days where you carry the latest
bowie album or roxy music album as you

97
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:03,340
go to school.
I mean,

98
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,070
you can't play an album at school,
but you were being cool just showing,

99
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:10,250
look what I got and I'm not into
meatloaf.

100
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,910
I'm into Bowie.
Yeah.

101
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,250
And so I attracted their attention and I
had long hair and earrings when it was

102
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,500
quite a risky thing to do in Dublin.
I mean we didn't have the liberation

103
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:27,450
that America and Britain had in,
in,

104
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,880
in the 60s,
but I did always look to England and

105
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:35,300
America mainly because of the music that
came from that.

106
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,180
But we became friends,
true music.

107
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,990
And we had real names,
as I said,

108
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:46,800
phenomenon via Derek Roan on a dreadful
nine.

109
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,550
And Paul Hewson.
Uh,

110
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,430
we gave each other nicknames just the
way most kids do,

111
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,260
you know,
but the nicknames,

112
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,290
I had more to do with
how we physically looked or our essence.

113
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,890
And I had quite square features as a,
as a young kid,

114
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,530
uh,
uh,

115
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,790
almost like this,
there was the surge was add on,

116
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,690
on the TV is search pipe called
[inaudible].

117
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,240
And that used to just come wyvern piping
and this big square pipe would come.

118
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,550
Um,
I can be full on at moments.

119
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,880
So I was called [inaudible] for a while,
but I'm a bit sauce softer and a little

120
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,990
softer than a [inaudible] search pipes.
So they changed that to Gavin?

121
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,780
No,
I didn't choose it as bundling.

122
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,870
Gogi you gave it to me and then Friday
was added because

123
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,610
I have a talent of
getting home at most people.

124
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,260
Um,
so it's a bit of a man Friday thing and

125
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:59,900
we gave each of these nicknames and,
and then we,

126
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,330
we didn't,
we had similar interests.

127
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:05,450
We were into sounds really pretentious.
The 12,

128
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,930
13 year old kids were like into art and
poetry,

129
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,840
but we were,
we weren't into football,

130
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:17,180
we weren't into making music or being
into music and painting and stuff like

131
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:20,150
that.
And we call this sort of little gang,

132
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,180
Lipton village and we made up imaginary
games and it's just one day we form

133
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:29,060
bands and when they would make movies
and when they will do this and one day

134
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:32,810
we'll do that.
But I think a lot of kids do this in

135
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:37,520
their own way except 25,
30 years later,

136
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,880
legends happens because some of us have
become quite well known.

137
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,660
So the myth becomes magical.
So that I tend to sort of see it very

138
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:55,241
practical for me when I go out for a
drink bottle combined the pints cause he

139
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:59,010
has more money than me.
We're the same guys.

140
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,990
That's a tough one.
Uh,

141
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,160
I've always,
I've always done,

142
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,003
I mean,

143
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,053
yeah,

144
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,090
as a performer on stage,
I tend to sort of troll myself into the

145
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:16,000
character,
whatever I've written about.

146
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,010
So it depends on how I'm writing or when
I'm writing about

147
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,633
Eh,

148
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,650
a lot.
A lot of singers don't really know who

149
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:26,750
they are.
They sort of,

150
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:30,890
uh,
they have this massive insecurity and

151
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:31,850
there's massive

152
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,123
ego

153
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,620
and then sort of pulled the between
both.

154
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,050
I mean,
why do you want a lot of the people to

155
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:43,070
look at you all the time and listen to
you something going on there.

156
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,630
There's this sort of need to express and
attention.

157
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:49,000
It's not just ego,
it's,

158
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,000
it's some sort of complex thing.
And sometimes you know,

159
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,960
you,
you create characters to say something

160
00:09:56,961 --> 00:10:00,770
you want to say and a,
and then you just throw yourself into

161
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:03,500
that.
In the last couple of years I've been

162
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,970
acting a lot more of the one or two
movies.

163
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,010
I've done a lot of work with the Royal
Shakespeare Company.

164
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,820
Well that's been an intense baby.
I can tell you that.

165
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,090
I love,
I love the way an Irish man that can

166
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:20,060
hardly speak proper English is doing
shakespeare.

167
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:22,640
So I find that extraordinary as I got
older.

168
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,590
But
I always see music,

169
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,360
live shows,
performances as moments.

170
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,620
And to really get there,
you just got to actually get into the

171
00:10:36,621 --> 00:10:38,270
essence,
flushing the blood.

172
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,450
Maurice Caesar.
Um,

173
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,880
I worked with for a round from around
the 87 till around 2004.

174
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,270
How long is that?
It's a long time.

175
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,850
And
I started working in a club called the

176
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,160
Blue Jays as I started this club called
the Blue Jays in,

177
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:01,994
in,
uh,

178
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,180
post and prunes and I painted for a
couple of years and then I needed that

179
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:12,620
light I was telling you about.
I needed that attention or I needed

180
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,240
to open up and show people what's inside
me.

181
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,770
I don't know.
Uh,

182
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,740
so I wanted to perform again,
but in a low key way.

183
00:11:21,741 --> 00:11:25,850
So I did this speakeasy sort of
Vaudeville club called the Blue Jesus,

184
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,240
where I met up with Maurice.
I,

185
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:32,120
I'd come from a sort of a punk rock
avant garde background.

186
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,090
But as I,
as I sort of ended the band,

187
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:40,390
I started like getting into more two
more sort of structured music and even

188
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:41,900
classical and jazz.

189
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,060
Uh,
I started realizing,

190
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:48,350
hey,
before 1960 the was good music,

191
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,891
you know,
so,

192
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:52,580
uh,
I decided I wanted to work with somebody

193
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:56,020
that was trained and Morris was
classically trained.

194
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,310
So that journey we made three albums and
numerous,

195
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:05,311
numerous sidetrack and score and played
about 10 years of shows.

196
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:09,610
But it just sort of,
it w w you know,

197
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:13,050
Mara says playing with me this weekend,
uh,

198
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,120
we're still friends,
but I just think the relationship came

199
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:23,110
to an end spontaneously.
He wanted to move to West Cork and plant

200
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:26,350
trees with his wife.
I didn't

201
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,930
certain things kick in when you hit your
late forties and shit,

202
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,910
you know,
nothing really to do with me.

203
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,890
I was,
I think it's going back years.

204
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:44,920
I think it was on some TV situation and
Archie and

205
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,860
a lot of people think a file.
What's he out now?

206
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:51,940
He's doing this,
he's doing,

207
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,290
so what are you going to do next?

208
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,123
And I saw,
I don't know,

209
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,610
what do you want to do?
And honestly,

210
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,430
I don't know.
I just want to get better.

211
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,560
Um,
who do you want to work?

212
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:00,720
I don't know what I mean.
He says,

213
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,780
well,
where would you play?

214
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,830
I said,
look,

215
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:04,980
I'd love to play somewhere classics
somewhere.

216
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,020
Legendary,
a place where music was when music was a

217
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,700
Carnegie Hall.
I just set it like that.

218
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,510
So became this sort of between my
friends and different people.

219
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,080
Oh God was going to play Carnegie Hall,
a Guy Who's going to play Carnegie,

220
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:21,700
oh blah,
blah blah.

221
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,100
Oh,
maybe you'll do shakespeare in Carnegie

222
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,000
Hall.
And just became this thing over the

223
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,020
years.
Like I could joke almost,

224
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,760
eh.
And then,

225
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,050
you know,
my friends as I was talking about were

226
00:13:35,051 --> 00:13:39,760
all turning 50 slowly or quickly.
Uh,

227
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,190
and Gogi turned 50 in May.
I went,

228
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,750
a gang of us,
went to a really nice hotel,

229
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,100
had a beautiful weekend,
and we had a few drinks and my good

230
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:54,090
friend bonuses,
uh,

231
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,033
Hey,
uh,

232
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,830
you know what you're doing for your
50th.

233
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,760
And I said,
you know what?

234
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,610
I don't really care.
Whatever.

235
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,720
Once I'm with my friends and loved ones
and whatever.

236
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,120
And he says,
I know what you're doing for your 50th.

237
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,010
I says,
really?

238
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,701
He says,
yeah,

239
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:12,610
you're going to be working and you've
gotta be making a show,

240
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,570
you're going to be working for red.
Um,

241
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,080
when I have a few drinks on me,
I can talk,

242
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,510
but I shut up for the night.
So I was a little taken aback and it was

243
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:27,550
sort of out of my control.
I went,

244
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,940
what's this about?
But the guy who's putting the show

245
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:34,510
together,
how wilner I've worked with since 1988

246
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,260
and he's a little bit of a genius.
Well,

247
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,410
that's an understatement.
He is a genius in my mind.

248
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:47,310
And I've done many of us collaborations
and shows and he gets it.

249
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,200
Let's just see who wants to play with
you.

250
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,260
And that's true.
The dice up in the air and see what

251
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,410
comes down.
And I mean,

252
00:14:56,411 --> 00:15:00,070
you've seen the cost.
It's pretty extraordinary

253
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,260
from Joe Grades,
Rufus Wainwright's,

254
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,770
Martha Wainwright,
the Courtney love to Marine Mckee,

255
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,100
Eric Mingus,
Lydia lunch.

256
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,391
She,
you too,

257
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:17,140
as you've never seen you two as in it's
Bono,

258
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:18,520
it's out of,
it's Larry.

259
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:22,600
It's edge to some extra virgin prunes,
Gogi and Dick,

260
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,160
two actresses,
the incredible Elizabeth Ashley,

261
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,290
chloe.
Well

262
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,760
and more and surprise guests,
Laurie Anderson and I,

263
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,790
after I leave this interview,
I'll go to rehearse with Anthony

264
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,780
Haggerty,
uh,

265
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,420
for a few songs.
Um,

266
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,920
so what I'm most excited about is a lot
of music today is so over rehearsed,

267
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,080
so worked out.
So unspontaneous these events,

268
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,310
we've got three days of rehearsal and
just putting in a lot of people

269
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,900
abduction and thoughts and emails and
letters and conversations.

270
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:10,530
But you're getting a group of musicians
almost like a workshop that loved music

271
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,700
that are like pushing it out there and
spontaneously doing something.

272
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,320
And that's a rare thing these days.
And this,

273
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,630
I don't know what's going to happen and
I love that because in these days and

274
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:30,550
age,
everything is so ordered an anal and

275
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:35,551
music is about spirits and spontaneity.
And that's what we're going to do on

276
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:36,454
Sunday night.

277
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,940
Do you think are going to live to a
hundred?

278
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,040
I'll have to,
maybe bono can arrange that.

279
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,660
That would be interesting.
Hey,

280
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,400
bondo.
Thank you for my 50th.

281
00:16:47,401 --> 00:16:50,610
Can you make me live another 50 years?
Uh,

282
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,770
you know,
it's just such a pleasure to be on an

283
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,020
honor that,
and you know what's so great is that

284
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:01,220
we're making money for AIDS and Africa
is,

285
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,200
it was a lot of love and spontaneity.
We're doing something creative.

286
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,240
That's what I love about Rad.
It's,

287
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,090
it's not just a charity.
Give us money,

288
00:17:09,091 --> 00:17:11,160
give us money.
It's being innovative.

289
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,930
Like,
here's a show,

290
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:18,090
but you won't see anywhere else.
And you can come and whatever you pay

291
00:17:18,091 --> 00:17:20,010
for your ticket,
it's going somewhere.

292
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,140
You can go and buy a pair of our manny
shades like Bono,

293
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,500
but the money goes to Africa.
That's,

294
00:17:28,501 --> 00:17:30,320
it's quite cool.
But I,

295
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,620
I,
I'm actually quite modest.

296
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,410
All of us as a nice,
all one is,

297
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,820
is,
is a drink at midnight on Sunday night.

298
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,500
And I'll be a very happy man.
