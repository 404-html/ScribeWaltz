1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,660
Eye Witness testimony,
uh,

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,700
of course is the single greatest cause
of the conviction of the innocent.

3
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:10,310
And what's fascinating about that is
that,

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,230
uh,
we have now,

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,240
um,
30 years,

6
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:19,241
more than 30 years of fantastic research
from experimental psychologists who

7
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:21,614
have,
uh,

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,660
you know,
recreated crime scene.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,860
We recreated a events and,
uh,

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:33,190
played around with which different way
we do a photo array or a lineup and

11
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:37,790
different techniques that are used
correlate more with accurate and

12
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:40,160
reliable identifications in which,
uh,

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,050
techniques lead to errors.
And,

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,390
uh,
a number of reforms have been,

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,180
uh,
uh,

16
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,010
adopted,
uh,

17
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,420
by federal

18
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,540
commissions and the American Bar
Association,

19
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,590
the International Association of Chiefs
of Police,

20
00:00:55,591 --> 00:01:00,270
lots of policing entities based on
really good scientific research.

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,220
I mean,
a lot of this research,

22
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:06,120
there's Meta analyses a,
that's where you pulled together lots of

23
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:07,830
different studies,
um,

24
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,380
and you have a lot of confidence that
certain things,

25
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,390
uh,
are real effects.

26
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:14,320
And I'll give you some examples.
Uh,

27
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,830
that may surprise people.
Um,

28
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,150
for example,
before you show somebody a photo array

29
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:24,270
or a live lineup,
he should tell the witness.

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,730
Um,
we're now going to show you some

31
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:28,830
pictures or people,
uh,

32
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,130
uh,
please keep in mind that the real

33
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:35,520
perpetrator may or may not be in this
photo array or a lineup.

34
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,430
And if you don't make an identification,
don't worry,

35
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,150
the investigation will continue.
Just giving that morning,

36
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,480
uh,
dramatically reduces incorrect

37
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:49,830
identifications without really reducing
correct identifications.

38
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,090
And that's of extraordinary importance
obviously in terms of being able to go

39
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:56,070
out,
find the real perpetrator and not arrest

40
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:57,360
the wrong person.
Uh,

41
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,320
uh,
there's lots of reasons we think that

42
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,600
this warning will reduce era.
Uh,

43
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,870
certainly it inhibits people from
guessing and,

44
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:07,680
uh,
uh,

45
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,170
there's kind of a natural inclination to
do that.

46
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,180
Um,
another reform that's of really critical

47
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:19,110
importance is that the person that
administers the lineup of the photo

48
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:22,710
array should be double blinded.
That is to say that the person should

49
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:25,510
not know who,
uh,

50
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,290
the suspect is.
Um,

51
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,960
uh,
and that's important for many reasons,

52
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,090
not the least of which is the
possibility

53
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,600
of,
uh,

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,040
feedback,
um,

55
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,370
confirming feedback.
What again,

56
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:48,430
Meta analyses have shown is that if you
say to somebody off you picked that

57
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:53,180
number too good or it gives some kind of
confirming feedback,

58
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,520
whether a law enforcement person or
somebody else.

59
00:02:55,521 --> 00:03:00,160
Frankly,
what this does is it can falsely inflate

60
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,050
at the person's certainty that they made
the correct identification,

61
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,250
the witnesses belief that they had a
good opportunity to observe the

62
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:13,810
witnesses belief that they were paying
attention when the crime was committed.

63
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,570
Um,
all of these factors,

64
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,760
by the way,
certainty,

65
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,240
opportunity to observe paying attention
are all factors that the courts used to

66
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:30,300
be using or use frankly,
and trying to weigh the reliability of

67
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,120
identification when we know that let's
say some suggestive procedure has been

68
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:36,550
used.
So positive,

69
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,460
uh,
confirming feedback or even just the use

70
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:43,900
of an unduly suggestive procedure can
falsely inflate these so called

71
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:45,650
reliability factors,
uh,

72
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,721
uh,
certainty,

73
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:49,030
opportunity to observe,
attention paid.

74
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:49,931
And,
uh,

75
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:54,931
the legal tests are out of whack with
what the scientific evidence shows

76
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,950
more than a year ago.
Now,

77
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,240
the National Academy of Sciences came
out with a report about forensic

78
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:07,090
science,
generally extremely important report,

79
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:10,780
a landmark report that anybody really
interested in this field should look at.

80
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,120
Um,
and this report,

81
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,410
uh,
basically said,

82
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:19,360
look,
DNA testing is the only validated a

83
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:21,350
forensic discipline we have.
Um,

84
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,490
and in particular,
when you look at pattern evidence,

85
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:29,140
and by this they were talking about
fingerprints and tire tracks and looking

86
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:33,100
at the striations on bullets and trying
to determine just it gives me whether

87
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:35,740
they came from a gun,
particular gun or not.

88
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,630
Um,
all these,

89
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:40,600
uh,
pattern disciplines had not been

90
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,710
adequately validated,
uh,

91
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,220
because she would have,
uh,

92
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,000
an,
uh,

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,600
an experts coming into court and they'd
say,

94
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,960
I'm looking at the striations of this
bullet that we recovered from the crime

95
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:50,650
scene.

96
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,620
And now I found this defendant's gun.
And I fired a bullet from that.

97
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:55,630
And I'm looking at the two of them under
a microscope,

98
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:58,870
and I see all these lines and I think
there's quote unquote sufficient

99
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,640
agreement.
And by that.

100
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:02,710
And if I'm really a big quality
assurance lab,

101
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:04,900
I'll bring my buddy and,
and he'll look at the microscope and

102
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:07,150
he'll say,
I think there's also agreement here.

103
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,710
And from this I can now tell you that
this bullet came from that gun to the

104
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,020
exclusion of all other guns in the
universe.

105
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,510
Well,
think about it scientifically.

106
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:21,160
On what basis do you have a database?
Can you tell us anything about the

107
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,170
frequency of firing similar patterns if
indeed you have similar patterns?

108
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:29,110
Do you have measurement area here?
Can you give us a number?

109
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,810
You know,
with DNA testing we can give you a

110
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,520
number,
we can give you the frequency of a

111
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:37,000
particular DNA profile and the various
different populations.

112
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,340
Can you give us a statistic?
Um,

113
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,920
and the answer is no.
They weren't giving statistics.

114
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:43,840
As a matter of fact,
they were just saying it's unique.

115
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,740
This bullet comes from that gun to the
exclusion of all guns in the universe.

116
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,100
This is nonsense.
And the National Academy of Science said

117
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,290
so and so,
you guys are really got to go back to

118
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,260
the drawing board and do some basic
research.

119
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,760
Uh,
to find out what the answers are to that

120
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,130
question.
Even fingerprints,

121
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,390
um,
which we know I,

122
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,520
if you take all 10,
uh,

123
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,980
prints and you scan it in and you put it
into a data,

124
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,390
the database of known,
uh,

125
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,880
fingerprints,
you can do a pretty good job of

126
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:16,880
identifying somebody.
But that's not the question.

127
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:20,900
When you're talking about a small latent
print that a crime scene,

128
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:23,510
you get a partial thumbprint,
let's say,

129
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,590
and every time you lay down a print,
it's always a little bit uneven and then

130
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:30,560
you compare it to somebody else's thumb
print.

131
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,420
Can you say that this small latent
uniquely comes from that individual?

132
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,860
Well,
uh,

133
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,480
that is the way the testimony was going
in for years.

134
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,100
And it was a,
uh,

135
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,700
uh,
that scientific basis to say that it

136
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:49,340
uniquely was this person's print.
You can't say that.
