1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,440
Well,
I wouldn't call it open.

2
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:11,030
I close friends,
you know,

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,260
we,
uh,

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,210
she's been really helpful to me and uh,
I have so much respect for her.

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,520
Uh,
I've had the opportunity to spend time

6
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:24,521
with her a few times and I think she's
one of the most amazing individuals in

7
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:26,780
the world.
Truly.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,910
Um,
she's done so much good for the world

9
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:32,590
and she's been so successful and she
represents herself and,

10
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:34,820
and frankly she represents black people
really well,

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,683
you know,
she,

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,120
uh,
she's someone that we are really proud

13
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:43,121
of and I'm proud to be associated with
our.

14
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm proud that she loved my music enough
to recommend it to my,

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,120
to her fans and uh,
it means something.

16
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:56,260
And I think she's a great example of
someone who has been very careful with

17
00:00:57,921 --> 00:01:02,921
our brand and
has a name that actually means something

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,740
that when she associates herself with
something,

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,680
it carries weight.
And how many people can say that it's

20
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,220
really impressive.
And,

21
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:17,000
uh,
I'm proud that she's a decided that my

22
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:20,770
music is something that she really loves
her and that she finds worth

23
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:21,604
recommending.

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,080
He has influence on global culture.
I go to South Africa and Oprah there,

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,930
I go to Europe and people have seen me
on oprah.

26
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:37,030
There.
I go to my good friend.

27
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:41,050
His mother is from Pakistan.
A CC's me on TV.

28
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:43,750
They're uh,
you know,

29
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:47,410
through Oprah and uh,
she's influential everywhere,

30
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:50,140
but clearly she has influence here in
the states.

31
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,790
Uh,
I mean,

32
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,750
I don't need to state the obvious,
but her book club obviously makes a huge

33
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:58,330
difference.
A specific artists when they go on and

34
00:01:58,331 --> 00:01:59,164
perform their,
they,

35
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,110
their record sales go up,
mine go up when I go on their show,

36
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,500
uh,
it means something to be one of her

37
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:09,160
favorite things or something that she
wants to promote to the people.

38
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:13,750
It really does make a difference.
And that comes from her being known for

39
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:17,590
good taste,
known for integrity and known for being

40
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,650
cautious about how
you would think actually because of so

41
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,890
many,
uh,

42
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,930
different
forms of media.

43
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,730
So many,
uh,

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,610
uh,
disparate ways that people get

45
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:41,530
information nowadays that the influence
of one person would actually be kind of

46
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,540
diffused in a certain way.
But for some reason a oprah has

47
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:50,920
maintained that power.
Even as people are watching less TV and

48
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,420
uh,
you know,

49
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,230
paying attention to the Internet more,
even as people are getting their

50
00:02:56,231 --> 00:03:00,540
entertainment and all kinds of ways,
they still listen to what says and a

51
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,580
part of it may have to do with her
audience and maybe they're,

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,800
her audience is still kind of a majority
women that stay home during the day.

53
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,830
And so for them,
uh,

54
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,890
you know,
the TV's on and Oprah's on,

55
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,700
she's gonna have some influence on them
and why not?

56
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,920
I think she uses her influence for good.
