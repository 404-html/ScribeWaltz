1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,570
Yeah,

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,840
support for big thing comes from
Microsoft delivering people ready

3
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:15,130
enterprise solutions designed to help
companies do more with less details at

4
00:00:15,131 --> 00:00:17,500
Microsoft.com/people ready.

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,370
It's actually more possible to move
market share than it might be in a

6
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:32,371
normal environment and so being able to
have better awareness and being able to

7
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:36,820
more quickly respond competitively is of
more importance.

8
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,940
Realtime monitoring is a process by
which companies are building business

9
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:50,491
intelligence to understand in the way
that a national intelligence agency

10
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:55,090
would what is actually going on in the
ground on the ground in different parts

11
00:00:55,091 --> 00:00:56,890
of the world,
in different parts of their business

12
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:02,170
that allows them to more quickly respond
to changes in the external economic

13
00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:03,820
environment,
to competitive moves,

14
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:08,821
to changes in the financial markets,
to changes in prices and reactions of

15
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,060
different moves that they're making so
that they can have an awareness of how

16
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,410
each of those changes may influence what
their business response should be and

17
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:21,670
more quickly adapt to them.

18
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,950
Even before the crisis.
The,

19
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:31,220
the Internet and other related
communications and information

20
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:36,221
technologies enabled a level of
transparency inside of institutions.

21
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:40,880
Not just businesses,
but government and social sector

22
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:44,210
institutions that was not possible for
before,

23
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,570
whether it's yelp for restaurants,
whether it's youtube for a social

24
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:54,970
movements,
whether it's the ability to create a,

25
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,880
a movement on the Internet that creates
a new president.

26
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,810
Those are environments that would not
have been possible without the

27
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:07,811
ubiquitous the capability and the low
cost of technology and we've not yet

28
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:13,871
seen what that means for how companies
and large organizations actually operate

29
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,510
in that new environment.
It's going to force a level of

30
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:21,620
transparency.
It's going to force a level of ability

31
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:26,621
to respond quickly to things that is
going to challenge many traditionally

32
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:29,240
organized institutions.
Uh,

33
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,630
I think in the intermediate term that's
actually going to be good.

34
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,450
It creates a kind of competitive
pressure,

35
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:40,340
a kind of necessity to deliver in the
light of day.

36
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,640
That in general will be good.
It will particularly be challenging,

37
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:48,350
but in some ways will be very good for
the most opaque institutions,

38
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:52,550
particularly in the government.
Creating visibility into how money is

39
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:56,090
spent.
Creating visibility into what the real

40
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:59,680
returns on investment are.
Creating visibility into the actual

41
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:02,470
activities that occur.
And how well they're done or not

42
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,890
creating visibility into how customers
and tax payers and employees think about

43
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,440
institutions is challenging,
but it forces institutions to be better

44
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,220
and that's good for the economy.

45
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,760
It requires that that technology be
thoughtfully invested against processes

46
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:28,060
and activities that actually make a
difference for the organization and that

47
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:32,110
you adapt how you do business to reflect
that technology.

48
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,970
I think that's going to be true in the
next generation of web to Datto

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,260
technologies as well.
They can be important enablers of

50
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,570
allowing particularly complex
transactions and interactions between

51
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,360
individuals and groups within a company
and between organizations to happen much

52
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:55,870
more effectively,
but they need to be done in a way which

53
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:59,290
are effectively implemented and
processes that are changed to take

54
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,830
advantage of that.
I personally find that quite exciting

55
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,090
and the opportunities for knowledge
sharing for real collaboration,

56
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,480
for opening up ways to interact with
people halfway across the globe in a

57
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:16,960
realtime way interactively is just quite
exciting.

58
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,750
And for someone who spent half their
life on an airplane,

59
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,540
being able to do that in video
conference rather than getting on an

60
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,510
airplane for a one hour meeting,
I find quite compelling as well.

61
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,520
I think the availability of some
technologies that allow for virtual

62
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:34,860
interaction,
whether it's really high quality video

63
00:04:34,861 --> 00:04:39,861
conference or a web presence,
don't diminish the need for personal

64
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:44,640
interaction.
They just changed the nature of it.

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,080
And what it means is that you use the
time when you're together for the kinds

66
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:52,470
of social interactions and getting to
know people and really creating trust

67
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:56,190
and the relationships that then enable
you to operate,

68
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,180
to operate effectively,
virtually going forward.

69
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,340
Um,
it,

70
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,310
it doesn't diminish the importance of
being together.

71
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,540
It just changes the purpose of that and
allows you to be more effectively using

72
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,810
your time in different ways.
Given the availability of personal

73
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:16,110
interaction and technology intermediated
interactions and other settings.

74
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,690
