1
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,930
In some of my recent writings,
I've argued that,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,290
you know,
global trade does seem to be driving

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,410
down wages for unskilled or semiskilled
workers and countries like the United

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,330
States in western Europe.
And I think this is an important

5
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:22,710
political issue.
You know,

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,370
there's no question that inequality has
risen in the United States.

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,020
Um,
wages,

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,060
you know,
for ordinary workers have been fairly

9
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:32,610
stagnant or have only risen a small
amount,

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,980
you know,
while incomes at the high end of the

11
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:38,400
salary scale have gone up a lot,
and at the very top of the income

12
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:39,660
distribution,
you know,

13
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:43,230
incomes have gone up spectacularly.
So I do think that's a very important

14
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:46,650
issue.
I would argue that trying to address

15
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:49,770
that by restricting trade is not likely
to succeed.

16
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,140
You know,
it makes the whole country poor.

17
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,200
Uh,
it's a bad way to treat the developing

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,630
world.
The developing world is benefiting a lot

19
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:59,020
from this regime,
you know,

20
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,230
so if you look at the whole look around
at the whole world,

21
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,780
you know,
do you want to try to pursue a solution

22
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:06,600
in the United States that's going to
make the poor countries poor?

23
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,370
Uh,
that doesn't appeal to me.

24
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,930
I don't accept,
uh,

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,040
the notion that restricting trade can be
any part of a progressive agenda.

26
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,560
I like to think of myself as a
pragmatic,

27
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:19,830
progressive.
So I think when you worry about wages

28
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:22,530
for ordinary workers in the u s which I
do worry about,

29
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,010
I think you have to look at the tax
system in the United States.

30
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,850
I think you have to look at public
expenditure on education and key

31
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:32,280
services that actually reach ordinary
people.

32
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,080
So I think what Larry Summers is arguing
is that there are a fiscal measures and

33
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:40,320
policy measures you could take that
would really make life better for the

34
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:43,230
working class.
I don't think Larry Summers is arguing

35
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:47,130
against the free trade regime,
but I think he's smart enough to realize

36
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,400
that if you don't do something for
ordinary workers in the United States,

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,340
you may lose the political support for
free trade.

38
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,670
And that really is an important engine
of the whole global growth.
