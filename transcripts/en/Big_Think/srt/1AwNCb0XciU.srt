1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,323
When we look at the world's skills,
one of the biggest sources of it is us 

2
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:16,410
failing to do the right thing when it's 
the harder thing to do,

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,800
giving into temptation,
giving into impulse,

4
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:20,634
giving into emotional sort of immediacy,
and the part of the brain that's most 

5
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:25,254
central to whether or not that happens 
is the frontal cortex most recently 

6
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:30,324
evolved part of the brain.
We've got more of it proportionately or 

7
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:35,700
more complexly than any other primate 
species out there.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,970
It's the part of the brain that does 
impulse control,

9
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:39,804
longterm planning.
Emotional regulation does all the stuff 

10
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:46,950
where it's the frontal cortex that 
whispers in your ear saying,

11
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:49,080
do you really,
really want to do that right now?

12
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,450
I'm waiting to that.
You're going to regret it.

13
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,240
It seems like a great idea.
Frontal cortex about that.

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:55,703
Okay,
so when we look at our moments of life 

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,703
where there's that enormous temptation 
to do the impulsive thing and what's 

16
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:07,980
going to determine whether the world 
will be freed of impulsive horrors.

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,160
If only we can all get stronger frontal 
cortices trained in childhood to be able

18
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:17,160
to hold out where you can have one 
marshmallow right now,

19
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:17,994
but if you wait,
you can get to later and training from 

20
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,070
early age so that your frontal cortex 
has the most fabulous aerobic metabolism

21
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:26,664
ever and it could just make you and what
the studies suggest is at all sorts of 

22
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:33,530
junctures of doing the harder thing.
Yeah,

23
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,600
having a really robust studly frontal 
cortex may do you a lot of good there,

24
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,970
but when you do sort of the truly 
difficult thing,

25
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:42,804
when you see people who are the ones who
run into the burning building to save 

26
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:48,324
the child in their leap into the river 
when everybody else was standing there 

27
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:54,570
like headless chickens,
when you look at those people,

28
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,583
they're not doing it because they've got
the most amazing frontal cortex is on 

29
00:01:58,501 --> 00:01:58,770
earth.

30
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,470
That could reason through the longterm 
consequences of,

31
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,603
oh,
what if nobody in society came to the 

32
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:04,794
aid of strangers?
What they do is they do it 

33
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:07,794
automatically.
You ask you ask anybody who does one of 

34
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:11,604
these heroic acts.
What were you thinking when you jumped 

35
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,570
in the river and the answer's always the
same.

36
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,080
I wasn't thinking before I knew it.
I had jumped in.

37
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,420
When we do our most amazingly like 
wondrous altruistic acts,

38
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,200
it's not because we've got the most 
incredible frontal cortex is on earth.

39
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:31,500
That could like reasons.
It's because it's out of the realm where

40
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:36,501
the frontal cortex and it's out of the 
realm of temptation and limbic stuff.

41
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,673
We do the harder thing in a case like 
that because for us it's not the harder 

42
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:41,574
thing.
It's become automatic and that's where 

43
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:47,070
you see it.
You see the best success with temptation

44
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:49,710
when it isn't attempting,
when it's automatic,

45
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,420
when we've distracted ourselves.

46
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,433
All of that frontal like work your way 
through to the right decision gets you 

47
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,710
only so far.
Fabulous.

48
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,544
Study this.
This was work by a guy at Harvard named 

49
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,434
Josh Green,
who put people in a study in a brain 

50
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:09,040
scanner of some task where if they got 
it right,

51
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:09,874
they get a reward afterward,
and so there's an incentive to get it 

52
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:13,504
right and this wonderful manipulative 
setup where at various points people 

53
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:19,534
were under the impression that there was
a glitch in the system and the computer 

54
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:25,564
wasn't registering their answers.
So all they had to do was think what 

55
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:28,744
their answer was and then tell you 
afterward when they heard that the 

56
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:33,610
correct answer had they had the right 
answer or not.

57
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,740
In other words,
they could cheat.

58
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,713
And what you would see is it was a 
random task and most of the time people 

59
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:43,690
were having about a 50 slash 50 percent 
success rate.

60
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,210
And along comes the opportunities to 
cheat.

61
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:49,150
And if people's accuracy suddenly jumps 
up at that point,

62
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,240
uh Ha.
That's how you detect a cheat or someone

63
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,083
who's long at that point.
So the question becomes what's going on 

64
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:58,510
with the brains of people who cheated at
those opportunities?

65
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:01,570
And what you saw was as soon as that 
active came up,

66
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,080
their frontal cortex is activated,
like mad.

67
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,183
They're wrestling with Satan,
they're wondering if they should do it 

68
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:09,754
or not.
They're wondering if they should have 

69
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:12,910
done it the last time when they were 
honest.

70
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:15,400
They wondering if they're ever going to 
their wrestling.

71
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:16,240
All of that.
Okay,

72
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:17,074
so that makes sense.
Then you look at the people who are 

73
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,180
cheating,
opportunity or otherwise never cheat.

74
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,500
So what's going on in them,
and we've got the two models there.

75
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,790
One of willpower,
it's because they've got frontal cortex,

76
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,624
is that could chest like be be stoic and
calvinist and gumption out the Wazoo 

77
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:37,330
there?

78
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,163
Or is it a state of grace?
They don't cheat because you don't 

79
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:41,884
cheat.
And the prediction there is if it's all 

80
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:45,154
about willpower,
as soon as the opportunity to cheat 

81
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:47,794
comes up,
their frontal cortices are going to go 

82
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:53,500
through the roof in terms of activity.
If it's a matter of grace,

83
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,560
whatever,
and it was a matter of grace.

84
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:59,700
The people who never cheated,
it wasn't because they had the strong,

85
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,580
strongest frontal cortex is it's because
you don't do that.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,190
It was that simple.
It wasn't a temptation,

87
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,323
and that's much more of a model of.
It's not a realm of just having to work 

88
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,640
so,
so hard to feel for somebody else or not

89
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:17,860
pocket that thing,
even though nobody's looking,

90
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,410
you just don't do that.
It's automatic.
