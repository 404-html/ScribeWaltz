1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,640
Wealthy corporations and people love to
ask the question,

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,640
what can I do?
What should we do?

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,780
What can we start?
What program could we launch?

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,520
I would say to the billionaire,
change agents and corporate corporate

5
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,620
social responsibility departments of our
country.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,930
Ask not what you can do for your
country.

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,600
Ask what you've already done to your
country.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,020
Okay?
Before you want to start something of

9
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:33,780
your own little private,
unaccountable venture.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,930
Do an audit.
What do you pay people.

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,000
You pay people enough?
Do you use subcontractors to avoid

12
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:45,300
responsibility for those workers?
Do you pay benefits?

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,320
When do your benefits kick in?
What do you lobby for in Washington?

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,720
Do you lobby for things that
make everybody have a better life in

15
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:59,721
America or do lobby against social
policies that would cost you something?

16
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,370
What's your tax avoidance situation?
Are you,

17
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:04,220
do you happen to be this ernest company
that,

18
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,930
that that wants to change the world?

19
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,290
I mean this is this,
is this company paying its full measure

20
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,090
of taxes?
Does it use tax havens?

21
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:15,360
Does it do the double Dutch with an
Irish Sandwich tax maneuver?

22
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:18,450
Does it send money that came in islands
and then back and do all this complex

23
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:20,610
routing.
If you're telling me that there are

24
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:24,420
companies that do none of this stuff
that pay people well,

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,590
that don't dump externalities into the
economy,

26
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:31,530
that don't cause social problems.
If there is such companies exist.

27
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:33,420
Yeah.
Then once you've taken care of all that,

28
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,420
great,
doing some some projects to help people

29
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:38,640
is great,
but I haven't found very many such

30
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:42,480
companies and more often than not,
when companies do a lot of CSR,

31
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,490
it's because they understand that
they're not on the right side of justice

32
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:50,310
in their day operations.
So they want to do virtual as a side

33
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,770
hustle.
And the problem is a lot of these

34
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:56,730
companies tend to create harm in
billions and then do good in the

35
00:01:56,731 --> 00:02:00,720
millions and you don't need to be a
mathematician to know that we're the

36
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:01,950
losers from that bargain.

37
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,510
And you'd look at the b Corp Movement,
there's a lot of companies that actually

38
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:10,050
have an interest in trying to invent a
new kind of company that is not

39
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,660
predatory.
There's in the B Corp Movement,

40
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:14,730
a certification process for those
companies.

41
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:17,970
Now the challenges of them is that it's
a great thing,

42
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:22,200
but it's fundamentally voluntary.
And what this does is it means that if

43
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:22,980
you're,
you know,

44
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,390
on already good virtuous company,
you may be motivated to get into this

45
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:29,550
club,
but if you're Exxon or Pepsi,

46
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,470
um,
you know,

47
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:33,240
you're not gonna,
you're not going to be in this club.

48
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:36,480
One of the things I'd like to see is how
can we actually use the power of public

49
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:41,481
policy to get more companies to sign up
to simply not dump harm,

50
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,100
social harm into our society.
Whether that takes the form of toxic

51
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:51,470
sludge or obese children or,
uh,

52
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,900
workers with unpredictable hours and
income.

53
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,140
And in the B Corp,
we have a model of a company that looks

54
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,480
different,
but we don't have any kind of compulsion

55
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,290
around it.
So,

56
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,240
you know,
Senator Elizabeth Warren has a proposal

57
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:08,860
out to turn every American Corporation
to a b Corp as a condition for,

58
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,170
um,
getting a corporate charter.

59
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,230
I think there's less radical option that
I sometimes talk about,

60
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:19,231
which is why don't we just have a
different and lower corporate tax rate

61
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,810
for companies that in a certifiable way
don't dump huge social problems onto the

62
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,980
Commons.
Um,

63
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,940
and that that way we might see thousands
and thousands of companies electing to

64
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:32,050
become,
you know,

65
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,230
certified benefit corporations,
uh,

66
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,160
in order to avail of that lower tax
rate.

67
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:41,161
I think we have to start thinking about
how we attack one of the root causes of

68
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,410
this kind of,
um,

69
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,350
grading malfeasance in American life,
which is shareholder primacy and the

70
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:51,910
fact that many companies,
even ones that want to be better,

71
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,530
are at risk of violating their
shareholders' rights by doing so.

72
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,830
But I don't think we can do that
strictly by creating a voluntary,

73
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,930
uh,
pool of better companies.

74
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:05,080
I think we have to start using our
leverage of society to say,

75
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:08,830
if you want the benefits that we as a
society give you when you become a

76
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,560
corporation,
here's what we want in return.
