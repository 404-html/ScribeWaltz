1
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,940
Of course,
I had spiritual moments in a bland sense

2
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:18,290
of that word.
And I suppose,

3
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:23,291
but I think the right sense,
I have times when I am just transported

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,960
with awe and joy and a sense of peace
and wonder at whether it's music or art

5
00:00:30,951 --> 00:00:31,784
or,
or,

6
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,850
or just a child playing or some other
wonderful thing off.

7
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,850
And my sail boat,
uh,

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,860
being amazed at the beauty of the ocean.
Uh,

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,760
I think that people make the mistake of
thinking that spirituality in that sense

10
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,770
has anything to do with either a
religious doctrines or with

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,310
immateriality or the supernatural.
Uh,

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,300
the world is a stunningly interesting
and glorious place and at every scale

13
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,380
and the are that one can experience
because one understands something about

14
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:20,621
how the parts are put together is I
think far greater than the sort of,

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,500
or of incomprehension.
Just I think,

16
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:30,890
I think it's,
the universe is much more wonderful the

17
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,570
more you know about how it's put
together.

18
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,240
Of course,
we can change our brains,

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,530
uh,
through meditation.

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,930
Uh,
um,

21
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,660
you can change your brain through,
through doing crossword puzzles or,

22
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:46,000
or,
or reading a novel or through meditating

23
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:47,800
or through running.
Uh,

24
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,420
brains are stunningly adjustable
plastic,

25
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,590
uh,
organs and everything you do,

26
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,830
it changes your brain a little bit.
Uh,

27
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,780
otherwise you couldn't leave a trace of
what you do.

28
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,070
He couldn't have any memory.
Uh,

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,280
so meditation is one actually very good
way of changing your brand.

30
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:14,431
I think meditation plays some of the
roles that are played also by sleep of

31
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,470
restoring balance,
uh,

32
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,600
uh,
getting rid of tension and access and

33
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,660
generally calming the whole system down
so that it can confront the world anew.

34
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,620
It's a sort of a refreshment.
