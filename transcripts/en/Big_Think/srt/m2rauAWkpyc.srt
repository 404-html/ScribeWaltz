1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,310
Well,
what Star Wars does is it tells us about

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:14,260
parents and children and uh,
how connected each is to the other.

3
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:19,261
And it is probably the most stirring
tale I think of a boy's need for a dad

4
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:23,200
and a dad's need for a boy that we have
in modern culture.

5
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:27,040
And it kind of nail some of the
intensity of those feelings.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,770
It also,
and I think this is equally deep,

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,260
uh,
tells us something about redemption.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,720
So the idea is that,
uh,

9
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:37,110
if you can get your kid to love you,
uh,

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,840
it's probably going to be okay.
And also if you do something heroic and

11
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,090
good,
uh,

12
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,820
you can probably be redeemed in some
sense of your soul,

13
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:48,340
whether we're talking about religion or
nod.

14
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:50,920
You can be redeemed even if you were,
uh,

15
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,950
really a creep before that,
at least if what you do,

16
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:58,951
they redeemed yourself is very major and
important as it certainly wasn't star

17
00:00:59,051 --> 00:00:59,530
wars.

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,240
I think we're going to see themes about
parents and kids and redemption in the,

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,110
uh,
in the new episodes as well in terms of

20
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:09,770
empires and,
um,

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,280
republics.
Um,

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,280
what the movie's kind of capture.
And I think nail is that

23
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,270
authoritarianism,
uh,

24
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,690
has a bit of an appeal.
The idea that,

25
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,910
you know,
an authoritarian leader can get

26
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:24,880
something done,
then maybe take a little bit of the

27
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:27,700
chaos,
the freedom creates and uh,

28
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,730
get it into some sort of manage
management and that can make life a

29
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:36,340
little more orderly and people like
that.

30
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,640
But it also tells us that in every human
heart there is a kind of a need for

31
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,270
freedom,
meaning there isn't going to be a boot

32
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:51,271
on your face and there's going to be a
capacity for governor yourself and the

33
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,490
tail of the appeal of authoritarianism,
which really kind of captures what

34
00:01:57,611 --> 00:02:01,510
happened in Nazi Germany and captured a
little bit some of the appeal of

35
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:04,120
authoritarians all over the world,
including,

36
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,250
uh,
currently a Turkey.

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,970
And it gets that.
And it gets that in a way that is true

38
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:14,971
to the arc of human history and the
failures of authoritarianism because of,

39
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,250
um,
people don't like him food in their

40
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:21,340
face,
it kind of lightly,

41
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,240
but,
um,

42
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,120
uh,
but memorably captures that as well.

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,940
So if you're in a,
you know,

44
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:32,941
a country that's poor and where people's
property rights aren't secure,

45
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,460
or are you go on the streets and someone
might beat you up.

46
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,310
Or if you're in a country that's doing
pretty well,

47
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:43,360
like the United States and some European
nations,

48
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:47,830
but terrorism is a risk,
or if terrorism is unlikely,

49
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,000
uh,
still,

50
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,000
uh,
you might get something stolen or

51
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:57,210
somebody might knock out because there's
violent crime or even if it doesn't

52
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:59,980
happen to you,
if you read it about the newspaper,

53
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,640
then you might think,
uh,

54
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,330
law and order is a pretty good,
uh,

55
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,313
corrective.

56
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,180
And even if law and order means that
civil liberties and civil rights will be

57
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,420
reduced,
maybe that's a trade you will be willing

58
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:17,110
to take.
And we certainly saw that in the United

59
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,830
States at times over the past,
let's say 40 years.

60
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,680
And while in the United States,
in my view,

61
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:28,000
nothing really horrific has happened in
terms of the rise of authoritarianism.

62
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,870
The fact that there have been movements
away from civil rights and civil

63
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:36,670
liberties is suggestive of something
that's possible when people feel really

64
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:39,460
at risk.
So what Star Wars captures,

65
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:44,290
and this makes it transcend the kind of
simple dichotomy between the light side

66
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,020
and the dark side of the force is it
says that,

67
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:47,720
you know,
uh,

68
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,280
the dark side,
it does have a seductive power either

69
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:56,281
because it means that each of us can
wield power if we go dark or because it

70
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:58,270
means that,
uh,

71
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:03,300
somebody at least is going to be
controlled in control of human impulses,

72
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,200
uh,
that can,

73
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,670
um,
uh,

74
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,850
threatened us.
And if the controlling power is

75
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,790
reflecting those forces,
that's not so good.

76
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,900
But,
uh,

77
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:18,901
some people would rather live in an
orderly society that is not a day to

78
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,250
day,
let's say,

79
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,140
a unraveling than a society that is free
because freedom,

80
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,850
uh,
suggest the possibility at least of a

81
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,760
little unraveling.

82
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,060
Mm.
