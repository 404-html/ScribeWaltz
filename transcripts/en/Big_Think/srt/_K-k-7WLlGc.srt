1
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,230
To me,
there's no question that the United

2
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,520
States,
as a matter of policy,

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,140
must be against torture with sign
treaties to that effect.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,000
We brought people to trial
internationally because we accused them

5
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:28,001
of torture and some of the things the
Bush administration did fall into the

6
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:32,720
same category of tortures as the
Japanese.

7
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:37,490
We tried after World War II,
the legacy of the George W dot Bush

8
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:42,491
administration will be calamity,
calamity for our country here in America

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,870
and for the world.
For those eight years.

10
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:55,871
We went backwards almost the whole time.
So much damage was caused to the quality

11
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:02,090
of our government.
Good people left the government in

12
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:06,290
droves.
The executive branch was politicized by

13
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,560
people who,
uh,

14
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,530
when no,
nothings do nothings and they stopped

15
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:17,531
functioning and all the problems we had
here and abroad just festered and got

16
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:22,280
worse and got worse.
What a legacy.
