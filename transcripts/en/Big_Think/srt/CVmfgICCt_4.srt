1
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,990
Well,
I think that the community and the

2
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,290
loving and the end,
the care that you can get from religion

3
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,760
are very good things,
of course.

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,150
And if only there were more purely
secular groups that provided not only

5
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:29,850
the good works but also the community.
I think that would be a good thing.

6
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,570
I'm a,
I've been talking with various people

7
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:35,820
about the need to,
uh,

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,150
provide that structure in secular
organizations and I think it's possible

9
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:44,970
and I think we should work at it because
you're absolutely right.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
People sometimes when there's nobody
around to love you and take care of you.

11
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,190
It's great to have a group that you can
be welcomed into.

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,710
Well,
I suppose the simplest answer is it

13
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:03,711
would be good if there were a,
and there are already a churches without

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,920
dogmas and in fact,
uh,

15
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:13,020
more and more churches downplay dogma to
the point of evaporation and concentrate

16
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:19,400
on providing just the sort of a,
um,

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,680
a community of care,
mutual care and,

18
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,720
and I'm helping the world.
And so I think it's entirely possible

19
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:32,721
that churches will evolve into sort of
creedless organizations that do a lot of

20
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:36,330
good work.
And that would be wonderful.
