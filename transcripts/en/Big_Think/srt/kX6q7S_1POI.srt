1
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,070
Healthcare is the most information
intensive industry in the economy and it

2
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:20,640
uses information technology,
the least of any industry in the

3
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:23,640
economy,
so if you think about where do we need

4
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:25,320
information to most,
it's currently healthcare.

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,120
You need to know what's going on with
the patient,

6
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:29,430
what they're allergic to,
what kinds of issues they have,

7
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:33,450
what treatment options,
and yet we still do things by paper and

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,950
pencil,
storing things in huge stacks where you

9
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:40,110
can't retrieve them and they're not
there where you need them.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,300
Healthcare is amongst the lowest
productivity industries in the economy.

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,170
If you look at the well performing
industries,

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,080
they tend to have three features.
The productive industries tend to have

13
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:54,480
three features.
First,

14
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,310
they use information technology a lot.
They know who's doing what,

15
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:01,740
why they're doing it,
how rapidly they're doing it,

16
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:04,110
what the outcome is,
how to improve it.

17
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,290
They're always thinking about that.
They use information technology a lot.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,250
In healthcare,
we don't.

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,690
Second,
they have compensation arrangements that

20
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:16,020
are tied to improving value.
When employees create value,

21
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:19,530
they get paid more when when they do
things that don't create value,

22
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:21,840
that they don't get paid as much.
In healthcare,

23
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,930
you get paid for doing things for volume
but not for value,

24
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,000
and third is they.
They decentralize it so that changes are

25
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:32,370
made by workers.
Workers have authority.

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,360
The famous Toyota model,
any worker can stop the production line.

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,100
Why?
Because he or she has the right

28
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:41,130
information and the right incentives to
make sure that the cars are coming out

29
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:44,070
with the quality that they need to.
In healthcare.

30
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:48,300
The frontline workers are so busy just
getting by that they don't have the

31
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:51,600
opportunity to do better.
If you take those nurses who are

32
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:54,000
spending a third of their time
documenting things and say,

33
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:55,260
well,
couldn't we do better?

34
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,810
They'd say yes,
but I just don't have the time to figure

35
00:01:57,811 --> 00:01:59,850
out how I'm so rushed.
I can't figure it out.

36
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,630
Healthcare has got to get better.
It's got to get better on the

37
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:07,590
information and where we've made a good
start with the recent American recovery

38
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:10,150
and reinvestment act,
which is spending $30,

39
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:13,320
million dollars on health it
compensation changes,

40
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:16,020
which you need to follow that hopefully
in healthcare legislation that comes

41
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:19,980
this fall that will say we pay more for
value and not just for volume.

42
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,220
An organization changes,
freeing up organizations and helping

43
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:25,380
them learn from each other so that they
say,

44
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:26,214
hey,
you know what?

45
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,950
I really can make this a high performing
enterprise.

46
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:32,550
This doesn't have to be an enterprise
that's got low productivity.

47
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,820
It come back to the most productive
businesses,

48
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:41,190
the ones that have increasingly lower
costs.

49
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,310
Those are businesses that are actually
the most innovative,

50
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,030
not the least innovative.
If you look at the most productive

51
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:51,720
industries in the economy,
their industries like information

52
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:53,250
technology,
like retail trade,

53
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:56,040
like agriculture that use technology
than most,

54
00:02:56,041 --> 00:03:00,850
but they direct it the right way for
people think that healthcare reform is

55
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,940
going to involve stifling.
Innovation is just absolutely wrong.

56
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,690
If we do it right,
we're going to open the possibilities

57
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:11,290
for enormous amounts of innovation.
We just give you a different example

58
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,124
than what we've seen.

59
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,660
Take a take an antidepressant.
Drugs,

60
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:20,260
just as one example,
it is a well known fact that

61
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,770
antidepressant drugs,
the same drug will work on some patients

62
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:28,771
and not work on others is give,
give people paxil or give people a

63
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,030
Prozac or give them selects or whatever
it is.

64
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,420
Some patients respond to it,
other patients out,

65
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,160
and it's different.
Some people respond to one medication,

66
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:38,800
some people respond to another,
some people respond to a third but not

67
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,870
to the others.
Why is that?

68
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,651
Well,
we don't know.

69
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:43,600
There's surely something biological
about it.

70
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:45,400
When you switch people from one drug to
another,

71
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:46,840
you,
you wind up,

72
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,793
uh,
sometimes,

73
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,450
uh,
getting them to respond to getting

74
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:52,600
better,
well with a little bit of innovation

75
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:55,930
will be able to figure out which
patients will respond better to which

76
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,850
drugs.
As a result,

77
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:01,090
we can avoid giving people drugs.
They're not going to respond to wasting

78
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,350
money,
wasting treatment.

79
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,960
The people don't come back because the
thing is not working.

80
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,110
Even worse with some kind of
chemotherapy agents where the patient

81
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:13,140
dies in the interim with innovation will
be able to figure out how to tailor what

82
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:17,770
you need once you get to what you need
in addition to all the other things

83
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:20,200
we're talking about,
so we'll have the medical care system

84
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:24,520
that's actually customized for you,
not just for something generic,

85
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:25,151
not just,
hey,

86
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:27,250
we just start on this because this is
what we do,

87
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,700
and if you don't respond better,
it's your responsibility for figuring

88
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:34,000
out how to do something different.
That's just one example of where we're

89
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:38,800
going to need a lot of innovation.
Healthcare reform has to encourage

90
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:41,270
innovation across the board or else it's
not going to say.
