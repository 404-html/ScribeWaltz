1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,160
You know,
what we like to do as,

2
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:15,750
um,
as a society is,

3
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:16,550
uh,
is,

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,730
is put things in boxes and label things 
and um,

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,623
you know,
we'd like to be able to say this is an 

6
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:27,261
elephant and this is a zebra.
And it was very easy to do that with,

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,150
uh,
with blogs and journalism.

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,080
Uh,
it was easier than it is now,

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,180
uh,
even a couple of years ago.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,200
So bloggers operated a certain way.
They wanted to be treated a certain way.

11
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:41,810
They had an expectation level,
there was a,

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,430
there was a,
there was an ethos of,

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,520
of transparency and ethos of,
uh,

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,453
you know,
doing things that you do and you don't 

15
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:50,634
do it with bloggers.
That was kind of an unwritten rule that 

16
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,890
was published.
And,

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,903
but what we've seen over the last couple
of years though is that the elephants 

18
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:02,730
and zebras have made it.
And I don't know what's,

19
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:03,564
what anymore.

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,763
So we have a,
we have journalists that blog all the 

21
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:10,220
time and I'm on twitter.
Um,

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,303
and yet we still have to treat them like
professional journalists and is 

23
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,290
absolutely.
And,

24
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,843
and as a way of operating with them,
there are bloggers that basically one 

25
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:21,654
little media companies and we have to,
they expect to be treated a certain way 

26
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,500
but not quite the same way that the,
uh,

27
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,140
the times once,
um,

28
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,570
but with different kinds of rules of the
road.

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,690
And then we have individuals that maybe 
have no rules whatsoever.

30
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:39,930
They just individuals who had day jobs 
who are publishing for passion.

31
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,840
So it's very blurry.
And,

32
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:44,674
um,
and so the rules of engagement really a 

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,940
variant and the blending of what's a 
journalist and what's a blogger is,

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,620
you know,
is obliterate.

35
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,581
I mean,
uh,

36
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,414
I mean it's more clear if you work for a
major media organization that you're a 

37
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:01,200
journalist and that's,
that's pretty clear cut,

38
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,881
but,
you know,

39
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:04,720
let's take us out like tech crunch,
uh,

40
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,371
which is,
uh,

41
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:06,840
one of the most popular blogs on the 
web,

42
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:09,330
which is independent,
you know,

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,260
is that a media company?

44
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,170
Do we treat them like we do?
Journalists don't know.

45
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,910
It's a,
it's a,

46
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,240
it's an or talking points.
Now here's another example.

47
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,613
So I think that,
I think at each individual is going to 

48
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:23,304
develop their own rules of engagement.
Each company will develop their own 

49
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,470
rules of engagement and some of those 
will be written in,

50
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:29,304
some of those will be unwritten and 
we'll have to test them in an ethical 

51
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:34,590
way and see and we'll see what works and
what doesn't.

52
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:36,420
I mean,
I'll give you an example with blogging.

53
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,390
Um,
you know,

54
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,740
a blogging as a,
as a company and not with people or uh,

55
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,470
or fake blogs,
uh,

56
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,290
never went anywhere.
It was something that was a,

57
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,100
that was kind of a nonstarter on 
twitter.

58
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,003
It's,
this seems to be more receptivity 

59
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:53,860
towards that kind of stuff.
Um,

60
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:54,694
I don't know if there's effective,
but there seems to be some more 

61
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:00,130
acceptance there.
So every community,

62
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:03,430
every site seems every person who seems 
to have their own rules and it's,

63
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,660
it's extraordinarily messy and it's not 
easy to just box things up.

64
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,540
So I joined Edelman in 2006 and I 
started my blog in,

65
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,880
in 2004.
And,

66
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:18,714
uh,
when I was the first two years I was 

67
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:21,624
blogging,
I was in a small PR company with 30 

68
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:25,350
people,
so we had,

69
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:27,870
you know,
15 clients and,

70
00:03:27,871 --> 00:03:30,270
you know,
that gave me a canvas that was huge.

71
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:31,104
I could write a anything,
anybody not be concerned about it 

72
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:33,750
because,
uh,

73
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,603
I didn't really have to worry about 
getting tripped up when I went to 

74
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:38,190
edelman.
Um,

75
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,083
you know,
that's a client that's an organization 

76
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:43,200
with 3,500
people around the world and,

77
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:45,210
you know,
we have thousands of clients and I don't

78
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:46,470
even know who our clients are.
I mean,

79
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:48,120
it's just so it's just huge.
And,

80
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,340
you know,
we could represent one company in,

81
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,061
in,
uh,

82
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:54,030
in one market and not represent them 
anywhere else.

83
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:54,930
I mean,
you know,

84
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,940
uh,
so it's really,

85
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,420
it's a,
it's a very huge organization.

86
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,830
And um,
you know,

87
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:03,720
the wakeup call I got was,
uh,

88
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,300
about two years ago,
I,

89
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:08,760
um,
initially when I got on twitter,

90
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:12,150
actually I'm in a stream of 
consciousness.

91
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,250
I just began to write about my media 
habits.

92
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,050
And,
uh,

93
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:17,880
and one of the things that I,
uh,

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,833
at the time,
I was getting a complimentary 

95
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:23,220
subscription to the print edition of Pc 
magazine and,

96
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,530
uh,
and so what I ended up writing was I get

97
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,110
a copy of Pc magazine for free,
but I throw it away.

98
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,690
Now,
the reason I said I said that is because

99
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:32,610
I actually was reading it online at the 
time.

100
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,570
Well,
I'm somebody who doesn't like us,

101
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,430
uh,
and doesn't like Edelman,

102
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,450
um,
reached out to the editor of PC magazine

103
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,590
at the time and,
you know,

104
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:45,660
he was understandably upset about it 
and,

105
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,680
uh,
and he wrote a,

106
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,220
a pretty nasty,
uh,

107
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,133
op-ed.

108
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,373
I'm criticizing not just a me but 
basically threatening to black list our 

109
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:58,110
entire pr firm.
So,

110
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,003
uh,
so he was basically saying he was 

111
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,980
posturing,
that he would,

112
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:02,880
you know,
any,

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,713
any approach from our,
from a to him or his editors would just 

114
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,540
be a nonstarter because of this little 
tweet that I wrote.

115
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,140
And that was a huge wakeup call.
I had a,

116
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,840
I had to go on my blog and a and a and 
ride a,

117
00:05:15,841 --> 00:05:16,800
a,
an apology,

118
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:17,760
a,
I mean,

119
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:20,190
it wasn't like somebody twisted my arm.
I was real already to do that.

120
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:22,560
I had no intention of slamming it.
It was just a,

121
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,023
it was just something I wrote in the 
stream of consciousness and in twitter 

122
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:27,750
didn't give me a lot of room in it and 
it was early,

123
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:29,850
early days for twitter.
Uh,

124
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,713
but that,
that was a sign to me that I can't do 

125
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:35,880
what I was doing before.
It's,

126
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:36,714
I don't have that level of freedom and 
it's not because somebody's watching 

127
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:41,250
over me,
but it's because I just,

128
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:42,120
you know,
I have to,

129
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,193
I have to protect the firm.
I've got to protect our clients and 

130
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:47,250
obviously as part of that I got of 
protect me.

131
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,020
And uh,
and so that was,

132
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:49,501
uh,
that was,

133
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:50,430
uh,
a,

134
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,680
a pretty bad experience then,
uh,

135
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,633
but,
you know,

136
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,020
I came out for the better for it.
And I think so to de Soto.
