1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,310
Yeah,

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,140
well I think more than anything else,
I think he has been very instrumental in

3
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:19,800
developing just a sense of perspective
and balance,

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,420
so as hard driving as he is and I think
there are no entrepreneurs who are

5
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:28,560
successful who are not hard driving and
I think he would admit that,

6
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,250
you know,
he gave up basically having and raising

7
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:34,350
a family to,
you know,

8
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:37,440
make playboy the success that it is.
At the same time,

9
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:41,160
I think he has the right kind of
perspective on life as to what the truly

10
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:45,450
important things are.
And that's probably the best lesson that

11
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:47,490
you can actually give,
particularly your children.
