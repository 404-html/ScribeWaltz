1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,993
Right,

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,920
there is already a lot of collaboration
going on between a European countries

3
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:19,410
and China and,
uh,

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,880
between us and China,
and this is necessary from so many

5
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:27,330
different perspectives.
Um,

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,750
China is part of the WTO.
It is the major,

7
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:35,520
you know,
economy gradually will be,

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,140
and it's a sustainable development and
climate area.

9
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,650
It is essential for the global future.
So no doubt there has to be

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,100
collaboration and China is going to
develop.

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,560
They are,
they have ambitions and uh,

12
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,020
we have to realize that those ambitions
are not different from the ambitions

13
00:00:58,021 --> 00:00:59,020
that,
uh,

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,500
the dominated in our own countries when
our countries were being developed,

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,670
uh,
and new technologies were being put into

16
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:11,070
a function.
Uh,

17
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:16,071
so the best thing we can do is to be
collaborative and a secret that the

18
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,130
patterns that are used are inspired by
future technologies.

19
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,330
And it will benefit all of us.

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,100
I,
you know,

21
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:26,934
this,
uh,

22
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,290
being so afraid about competitiveness,
I have never understood,

23
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,900
even as a prime minister.
I mean,

24
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:40,370
unless you have products or services to
sell to others outside your own country,

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,410
then you better look for,
uh,

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,980
other things that you can do better.
We live in a,

27
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:53,981
in a world where we all benefit from
doing what we are best at doing and,

28
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,350
and use our minds and our efforts to
promote a development pattern that

29
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:04,500
benefits all of us.
So this year,

30
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,800
this drama about being so scared about
everybody else,

31
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,910
I have never really taken onboard.
