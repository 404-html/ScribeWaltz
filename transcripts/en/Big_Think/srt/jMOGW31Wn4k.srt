1
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,260
All the experts,
by that I mean the NYP dea and the FBI

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,560
agree I should be dead
and somehow I managed to get through

3
00:00:13,511 --> 00:00:17,260
this horrendous experience.
First of all,

4
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:19,960
I stayed very calm.
I stopped,

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,190
I thought I listened.
I didn't do anything without calculating

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,700
the,
the power and the impact of my words.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,070
For example,
Stanley,

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,420
it's your birthday.
Wow.

9
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:33,370
You deserve something nice for your
birthday.

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,730
How about a sexual favor for your
birthday?

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,590
Obviously they didn't use those words,
but I won't say them on camera here.

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,760
Um,
and

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,730
going slow and being calm and thinking
about it,

14
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:51,640
I realized that if I said no,
I might be very offensive.

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,040
Why doesn't this lawyer?
I think that our girls are good enough

16
00:00:57,041 --> 00:01:00,910
for him.
So I was very careful to answer in a way

17
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:03,850
to not offend.
So I said,

18
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:05,230
well,
I'm sure the girls are lovely,

19
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,710
but considering my circumstances,
I'd really rather not made it seem

20
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:10,810
light,
but yet very respectful.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,640
And actually many hours later I had the
opposite problem because they were

22
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:18,100
smoking marijuana.
They were in a good mood and I'm

23
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:23,110
blindfolded with my own scarf covering
most of my face and one of the men said,

24
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:25,654
well,
these,

25
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,820
you know,
Stanley,

26
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,250
uh,
I think these girls are starting to like

27
00:01:30,251 --> 00:01:31,810
you.
They're looking at your lips.

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,450
And that gave me the opposite problem
because if we went down that path and

29
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:40,510
their,
their girlfriends liked me,

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,650
they could get angry at me for the fact
that their girlfriends like me.

31
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,850
So I had to deflect it in the opposite
fashion.

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,910
And I and I,
and in that instance I used humor,

33
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,090
which I think you have to use very
carefully in these situations,

34
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,180
but humor is another thing in the
arsenal of,

35
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,660
of a hostage,
but only to be used sparingly and with

36
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:03,220
great care.
And I said,

37
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:07,420
really the only reason these girls like
me is because most of my faces covered.

38
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,950
And they thought that was hysterical and
they burst out laughing.

39
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,121
Now,
the fact is,

40
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:16,180
if you use humor the wrong way,
it can twist against you.

41
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:19,990
For example,
there was a point at which they,

42
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:21,370
again,
they are high on weed.

43
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:23,710
They've had sex with the girls,
this is the second time around.

44
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:28,390
I was there for 25 hours and and they
start,

45
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:30,640
one of them started imitating a Jamaican
accent.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,710
Well,
I'm very good at doing all sorts of

47
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:37,711
different accents and I pondered very
carefully whether to go with it and go

48
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,500
where they were and I made a decision to
do it so I imitated my Jamaican accent

49
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,010
for them and they loved that.

50
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,420
It was,
it was hysterical to them.

51
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,630
The thought that this polished pressed a
Caucasian attorney could be imitating a

52
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:55,360
Jamaican accent was was hysterical to
them,

53
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:59,770
but then they were talking about a store
that was owned by Indians and I thought,

54
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:02,410
well,
should I do another kind of accent just

55
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:04,810
to have some fun and keep things light?
And I said,

56
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,130
no,
let me stop because I didn't know it and

57
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,160
others.
As long as I was doing an accident that

58
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:10,420
they were doing,
I thought,

59
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:11,590
okay,
that's far enough,

60
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,500
but don't take it any further.
You just don't know when they might

61
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:19,210
twist against you.
So I think survival skills stay very

62
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:20,500
calm.
Think,

63
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,910
listen,
observe,

64
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,850
understand your circumstances.
Also,

65
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,460
give up your ego,
give up who you are.

66
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,280
I was a federal prosecutor in that
position.

67
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:33,490
I had considerable power in this
position that I was in.

68
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,820
I had no power at all except the power
of my wits,

69
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,570
which I tried to get by with a but,
but,

70
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,550
but understand that you're no longer who
you are.

71
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,940
I'm in the situation and adjust to that.
So that's another principle I would say

72
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:54,160
for survival is to be very flexible.
You know,

73
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,910
getting the car guns pointed at me,
you know,

74
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,640
if I was inflexible,
I might've started,

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,560
you know,
yelling,

76
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:04,270
fighting,
uh,

77
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,940
all the detectives I spoke to say,
listen,

78
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:10,900
you can't second guess yourself Stanley,
because you managed to survive.

79
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,660
And I think because I was flexible I was
able to go with the situation that

80
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:19,750
helped me a lot.
And another thing you need to do is feel

81
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:22,080
some sense of empowerment.
I mean,

82
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,730
let's look at my thing,
how much control that I have.

83
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,820
I had seven people with automatic
weapons on me who could have killed me

84
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:32,950
at any moment and who might have killed
me at any moment.

85
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,270
And I have no doubt in my mind,
nor does the Myp dea or the FBI,

86
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:39,850
that they were perfectly capable of
doing it.

87
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,400
Yet there were certain things where I
felt I needed to keep control.

88
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,890
For example,
when I first went in,

89
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,750
they invited me to take off my shoes.
I said they put me down in a mattress.

90
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,890
They took off my trench coat.
I kept my sport jacket on,

91
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,750
but they invited me to take off my
shoes.

92
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,520
And you know what I thought in my head,
I thought a guy with his shoes off isn't

93
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:06,880
walking out.
Very powerful symbolism.

94
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,450
So I said,
no thanks.

95
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,630
I'll leave them on because in my mind,
and I think in the psychology of the

96
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:16,330
room,
a man with his shoes on could walk out,

97
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,510
a man with his shoes off might not get
the chance to walk out.

98
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,800
Or for example,
uh,

99
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,300
there was the point in time I purposely
didn't ask to go to the bathroom.

100
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:31,120
I didn't want to ask for anything that
wasn't offered to me.

101
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,520
But they eventually asked me if I needed
to use the bathroom.

102
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:35,600
I said yes.
And as soon as I said just,

103
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,980
they jumped up and sort of military
alert cocking the guns,

104
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,950
pointing them at me and it was,
they were nervous that on the way to the

105
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:45,070
bathroom I might pull something.
So again,

106
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:48,670
there I felt the need to maintain some
control even though they've got the guns

107
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,440
there,
they're in control still.

108
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:53,530
I wanted some small bit and I stopped
and I said,

109
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,311
Whoa,
Whoa,

110
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:55,690
whoa.
I didn't even get up.

111
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,740
I said,
Whoa,

112
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,290
hang on a second,
relax.

113
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,700
I'm not going to do anything.
All I'm going to do is go to the

114
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:06,500
bathroom.
And they calm down.

115
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,200
And then we went to the bathroom and I
didn't get shot.

116
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,490
Another example of maintaining some
control was when I first got in there,

117
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,740
they kept calling me,
stephen

118
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,200
and I kept saying,
my name is Steven Stanley.

119
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,210
They thought this was really funny.
Oh,

120
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:23,720
sorry.
Stanley Stevens,

121
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,640
the guy we did this to the other night
and it turns out later they had actually

122
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,510
taken him to the bank,
not that the apartment gotten his money

123
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:35,350
and then and then and then left him in
the backseat of his own car.

124
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,340
I felt that it was very important not to
be called Steven.

125
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,030
I felt that it was important to be
called by my correct name.

126
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,290
My name is Stanley because my identity
was my life.

127
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,000
If I'm a real person with a real name,
then you're less likely to kill me.

128
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:00,390
And so I maintained that bit of control.
So I think that's also to feel a sense

129
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:03,010
of some empowerment.
And if you.

130
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,250
If you read the studies of posttraumatic
stress disorder,

131
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,520
what they say is that people get
posttraumatic stress disorder because

132
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,280
they felt the complete disempowerment.
They felt the complete lack of control.

133
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,280
I was in a situation that was out of my
control for the most part,

134
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:23,281
but where I could find it,
I used it and also I gathered clues the

135
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:26,860
whole time.
So that to me,

136
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:31,861
although purely psychological was a form
of control for me to have.

137
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,500
Um,
so I think all those things helped me

138
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,010
survive.
