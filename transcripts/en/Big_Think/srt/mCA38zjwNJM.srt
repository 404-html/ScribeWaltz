1
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,550
So Connor and I were in India.

2
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,500
We had flown there,
we were meeting with their judicial,

3
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:16,330
with the judges,
have their supreme court.

4
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:19,270
We arrived on that very day on that very
day.

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,050
Of course,
people that were horrified and there was

6
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:27,250
a tremendous outpouring of support and
people couldn't have been nicer.

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,370
And,
but it was a time for a thought.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,850
And really it seemed to me the,
the,

9
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:35,890
the,
and I mentioned it because,

10
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,780
uh,
what was in our minds after a week

11
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:41,980
there,
we spent a week there,

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,760
uh,
that the world is really divided into

13
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,340
the f.
What I think of is the forces of reason

14
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,950
and the forces of non reason and the
forces of reason.

15
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,440
Well,
law is part of that law as part of it.

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,530
Judges are part of it.
Lawyers are part of it.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,120
And so is everybody else on,
you know,

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,770
other professions,
the forces of non reason,

19
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:06,430
that's the risk.

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,730
That's the danger.
So I rather see that as a,

21
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:13,210
as a something that's unifying people
across the world.

22
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:17,200
Because people across the world do
believe in democratic systems.

23
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:19,630
They do believe in protecting basic
human rights.

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,530
Uh,
they,

25
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,740
they do believe in drawing to create
economies that will be,

26
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,590
make their people prosperous and uh,
uh,

27
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:30,610
they believe to a considerable degree in
international settlement of disputes,

28
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:34,000
things like that too,
but therefore says that they have to

29
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:35,560
fight against,
which are obvious.

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,740
So that's in my mind,
maybe that's how I was brought up to,

31
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,650
you know,
it was after World War II and efforts at

32
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:48,040
cooperation.
I as you look out today,

33
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:53,041
but also I'd say my experience tells me
that in a way it's like this sort of

34
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:55,150
somebody weaving allume.
I mean,

35
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:59,470
I'm not a political figure.
I'm not in politics and I don't,

36
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,041
uh,
and,

37
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:04,060
and people who do are,
are in politics and in very high levels

38
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:07,600
in government may see these
international institutions and global

39
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:09,730
politics going on at a very high level.

40
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,850
But I say to the lawyers and judges were
technical people were professionals and

41
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,530
at our level,
whatever happens at the other,

42
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,330
there is a kind of knitting going off.
It's like workers at allume.

43
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,300
It's happening in Europe,
it's happening in Africa,

44
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,830
it's happening in Asia.
People are learning from each other,

45
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,500
particularly in law.
How does it happen?

46
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,950
It happens at conferences.
People talk to each other,

47
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,010
judges talk to each other,
lawyers talk to each other.

48
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,670
It happens as different groups.
Try to create laws.

49
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:45,190
For example in Europe they are trying to
uh,

50
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,340
create commercial laws and bankruptcy
laws and tax laws and laws that will

51
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,850
govern several what were independent,
they are independent nations but they're

52
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:57,160
trying to get together and this is
happening,

53
00:02:57,161 --> 00:03:00,670
say the World Trade Organization
happening across the world.

54
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,020
It's popularly called globalization,
but what it involves or people in

55
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:08,980
business,
people in law learning what each other

56
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,830
are doing and they adjust their laws
accordingly.

57
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,820
It doesn't always have to be formal.
We used to have a group called the

58
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:19,540
uniform law commissioners and they go
from state to state and they'd say,

59
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,300
California does this.
And I go to Iowa and they say,

60
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:22,931
Iowa,
you know,

61
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:25,030
California does this,
maybe you should try it.

62
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,440
And that kind of thing goes on every
minute as we speak.

63
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,470
And then there,
there,

64
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:33,640
there are different organizations
developing,

65
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,160
well,
like the World Trade Organization or,

66
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,050
or there,
there are dozens of them there.

67
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,300
They're free trade areas are there,
there,

68
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:45,301
there are a health organizations,
there are communications organizations,

69
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:48,670
there's the internet,
there are all these things we know

70
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:51,640
about.
They are all forces working to bring us

71
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:54,610
together.
So what I see as happening,

72
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,200
and it's not a political matter,
what I see is happening is people who

73
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:03,610
are lawyers and judges in America today
have to be aware and they have to have a

74
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:07,600
system for being aware of what's going
on elsewhere because of the cases in

75
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:11,590
front of them will more and more depend
on what's happened.

76
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:20,730
Yeah.
