1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,040
I think,
uh,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,770
the great driver of all of these
participatory changes is the choice by

3
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:13,110
individuals to be active instead of
passive.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,180
Uh,
we fed ourselves on a notion that humans

5
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:21,480
were office drones at work and couch
potatoes at home and it was just kind of

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,990
shuttling back and forth from one to the
other and then when the opportunity to

7
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:31,950
participate came about even in know,
even in relatively small ways,

8
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:32,370
right.
I,

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,790
I'm going to be sharing photos of this
thing or I'm,

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,500
you know,
I wrote a poem and I'm going to put it

11
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:39,540
up on my blog and maybe only three
people read it,

12
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:44,541
but that's more than none a that,
that almost all of that is personal

13
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:45,331
drive,
right?

14
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:48,300
That's the big,
that's the big producer of the change.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,500
And the individual participants are the
beneficiaries,

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,271
right?
The,

17
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:53,640
the,
the,

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,350
the choice to be active benefits.

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,870
The person who makes that choice,
uh,

20
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,830
the,
the beneficiaries dance stream of that

21
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:02,220
is,
I,

22
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:02,820
you know,
as,

23
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,420
as we talked about earlier,
a really depends on what kind of sharing

24
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:09,030
is being done.
So if I make a new law cat run,

25
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:11,550
I find the cutest picture ever and I
give it the funniest caption ever.

26
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,170
It makes some people laugh,
right?

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,680
You can't claim a big social benefit
there.

28
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,160
Um,
if at the other extreme I'm at patients

29
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:25,161
like me and I'm trying to change a,
I'm trying to change medical research

30
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:28,320
culture,
I might get a disease,

31
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,920
uh,
understood and a cure developed faster

32
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,240
and that benefits not only everyone who
has the disease at benefit society as a

33
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:39,150
whole for having fewer resources go
into,

34
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,940
go into treatment of,
of,

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,950
of whatever disease.
It is a,

36
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,140
there's a lot of work recently on als.
And so once you get past an individual

37
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,440
who chooses to be active getting
benefits for themselves,

38
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:56,340
you really have to look at what the
participation is doing to see who

39
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:59,820
benefits,
but the range of benefits that are

40
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:04,380
possible from harnessing this cognitive
surplus is quite extraordinary.

41
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,290
I say it's bad when it becomes
addictive,

42
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,250
right?
And there's a big,

43
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,710
there's a big discussion about,
uh,

44
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,800
whether or not the word addiction is an
appropriate inappropriate words,

45
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:22,170
large.
A large clinical conversation about

46
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:23,930
Internet addiction,
et Al,

47
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,710
but I will tell you that in the early
nineties I felt it.

48
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:32,580
I used the word addict to describe
myself in a completely,

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,150
in a completely unironically.
I was addicted to something called

50
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:38,730
Usenet,
which is the global set of both boards.

51
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,100
And I had to addicts,
classic pathology,

52
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:46,101
which is that I needed to,
to be on using it every day.

53
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:50,940
Not because it made me happy,
but after a while because if I didn't do

54
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:51,870
it,
it made me feel bad.

55
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,860
Right.
Which is the,

56
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,700
you know,
and our,

57
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,700
I remember literally,
I remember the morning where I woke up

58
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,530
and I did not need to check my email and
I thought,

59
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,430
oh,
it was as if a fever had broke.

60
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,030
Uh,
the,

61
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,440
the deeply wired pleasures of social
interaction coupled with the kind of

62
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:16,861
mediated space we live in a can create a
can create these kinds of addictions and

63
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,680
people,
whether it's updating their,

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,390
updating their profile page on a social
network or it's playing a game or what

65
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:29,920
have you.
And it can lead people to do many of the

66
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:31,750
things that the pathology of addiction
does,

67
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:33,670
which is to cut themselves off from
their friends,

68
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,130
to neglect their social life,
neglect their schoolwork,

69
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,350
neglect their work and so forth.
And those are the kinds of things that

70
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:43,660
society has always grappled with,
right?

71
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:44,300
It's,
you know,

72
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,110
it's the problem around a gambler's
anonymous,

73
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:50,230
right where it's,
it's not that you're injecting a

74
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,550
chemical into your body,
not like alcoholism or,

75
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:54,640
or,
or cocaine or what have you,

76
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:59,380
but it is,
it is an activity that's changing the,

77
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:01,240
you know,
that it's giving you the endorphin rush

78
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,600
or giving you the chemical,
a chemical consistency like in your

79
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:05,434
brain.

80
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,800
And as with gambling,
there are kinds of activities that can

81
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:10,470
become addicting.
Uh,

82
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,460
my,
my personal guess,

83
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,980
although I am not a clinician,
my personal guess is that Internet

84
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:18,220
addiction and even more than the
Internet addiction,

85
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:20,890
particular classes of addiction,
social gaming addiction,

86
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:24,430
social network addiction,
so forth are going to be understood

87
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,420
better in the next five years.
They'll turn out to be much rarer than

88
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:30,400
the hand wringing in the press would
currently.

89
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,220
We currently have you believe where
everyone who uses facebook is a,

90
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:39,221
is an addict or a punitive addict,
but they will be a nontrivial number of

91
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:41,330
cases where people are genuinely
addicted.

92
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:44,140
And I think as a society will then have
to find ways,

93
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,550
uh,
to convince those people to help them

94
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,270
out of that addiction.
In the same way we have done with

95
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:55,420
gambling is gambling and spread outside
of Vegas to include most of the country.
