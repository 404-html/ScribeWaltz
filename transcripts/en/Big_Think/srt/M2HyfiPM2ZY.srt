1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,140
I
would like to

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,643
see

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,850
how he managed to maintain his
calm,

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,900
his peace,
his creativity,

5
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:26,901
and his compassion in the face of a real
cruelty in the face of apartheid,

6
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,530
in the face of hatred and injustice.
Because at no time did Mr Mandela

7
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,370
contribute to the melodrama by adding
his anger to it.

8
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,450
And that is where he's looked at one in
the world as a hero.

9
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,760
I'm not sure if there's any other living
person that I can think of right now

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,350
that,
uh,

11
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,310
still.
