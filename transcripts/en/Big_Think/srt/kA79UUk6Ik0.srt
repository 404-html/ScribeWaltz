1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,900
Well,
I think one of the most more surprising

2
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:08,220
things,
and this is something that I'm be

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,100
following and blogging about it,
some of the reports that have come out

4
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:14,450
of the Pew Research Center,
um,

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,900
it in,
in these analysis,

6
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:19,470
they're looking at a,
what exactly are people talking about at

7
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:22,740
blogs and this new media ecosystem,
whether it's blogs,

8
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:26,670
whether it's independent media,
whether it's twitter or whether it's a

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,280
facebook,
where is that content coming from?

10
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:29,910
Uh,
in,

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,740
in one particular study that they looked
at,

12
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:35,520
they looked at the media ecosystem
surrounding a Baltimore,

13
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:36,450
Maryland.
Uh,

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,330
and in that study,
what they found is roughly on average,

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,510
90 percent of the topics that were being
talked about at blogs or other

16
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:49,260
independent media originated with
traditional news organizations in

17
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:51,540
particular.
Either the local newspaper,

18
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,480
the Baltimore Sun for the national
newspapers in their,

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,060
in their online version.
That tells me that,

20
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,490
um,
where a lot of,

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,300
a lot of people claim that the
traditional media is no longer relevant.

22
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,960
In fact,
we fundamentally rely upon the

23
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:10,560
traditional media,
the role of the traditional journalists

24
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,060
as an independent professional,
a news gatherer to inform ourselves.

25
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,660
And it's the fabric of what we discuss
online and without the traditional,

26
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,260
a traditional news,
that traditional news gathering process,

27
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,810
we really wouldn't have a lot of good
content.

28
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,160
I'm,
uh,

29
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,590
and we wouldn't have a lot of original
reporting,

30
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,610
uh,
elsewhere.

31
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,780
Um,
uh,

32
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:31,790
online.
Uh,

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,860
the other really interesting thing is,
um,

34
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,240
uh,
more recently they looked at the major

35
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:39,360
blogs and they looked at an analysis of
the major blogs,

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,840
public affairs related blogs,
and they looked at what those blogs are

37
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:47,841
discussing and where the links are going
to m and a and more than 90 percent of

38
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:54,150
the topics discussed in the links.
We're back to the traditional media.

39
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,220
Uh,
and that's also interesting because

40
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:57,920
people claim now that,
uh,

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,870
the blogosphere now,
uh,

42
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,910
has this ability to control the news
agenda.

43
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,160
Well,
that's not necessarily the case.

44
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,450
The blogs are still influenced and
they're still driven by what's being

45
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:11,550
reported.
The New York Times or on the broadcast

46
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:14,580
news or on the cable news networks or
political talk radio.

47
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,300
It's that they take that content and
they sometimes refocus it.

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,720
They redirected,
they shape that agenda to either be in a

49
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:25,440
certain ideological direction,
they might reframe the significance and

50
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:27,060
the information that's being reported
on,

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,540
or they might take the agenda,
the traditional media and focus in on

52
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,370
just a few topics,
uh,

53
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:37,371
whether it's a foreign policy climate
change or particular political scandal,

54
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,820
you know,
there's a couple couple a things to

55
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:51,880
think about,
uh,

56
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:52,390
when,
when,

57
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,390
when you're considering a,
the tendency towards self self selection

58
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:00,370
itself,
exposure to different topics and public

59
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:02,110
knowledge.
One is that,

60
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,450
uh,
going back three or four or five

61
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,750
decades,
the 19 sixties when we've asked in

62
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:10,780
surveys,
quiz questions about the public's

63
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,840
knowledge of the most basic political
facts or the basic facts about issues

64
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:18,250
related to science or the environment.

65
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,690
Inevitably the public scores very low in
these fundamental a quiz,

66
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,760
a quiz like surveys about either public
affairs,

67
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:27,450
literacy or science literacy.
Um,

68
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,970
uh,
so that hasn't changed.

69
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,530
And in fact,
what we,

70
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,950
what we've seen over the last 15 years
is that public knowledge and public

71
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:39,580
scores and those types of questions
remain relatively relatively stable.

72
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,120
Um,
it's a question though,

73
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:46,310
whether that's the best measure of
public knowledge or of,

74
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,650
of,
of civic culture.

75
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,260
Um,
uh,

76
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,480
one of the things that we're seeing is,
is actually not necessarily a decline

77
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,320
in,
in basic public knowledge,

78
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,620
but a real problem at getting public
attention and in elevating public

79
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:07,561
concern about many different issues.
The environment is a great example where

80
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,640
climate change is a great example.
And,

81
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,160
and,
and this is a problem really

82
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:17,161
fundamentally have of choice.
It's the great paradox of the age of

83
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,080
engagement that today we have more
information choices about public

84
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:20,980
affairs,
politics,

85
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:21,850
science,
health,

86
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,670
medicine,
the environment than anytime in history.

87
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,150
Yet if you,
as a consumer of information or as a

88
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:32,230
member of the audience or an individual
lack of preference or a motivation to

89
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:36,100
engage with that a news and information
on a regular basis,

90
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,910
you can completely avoid that
information.

91
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,810
It,
it's not top of mind.

92
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,963
Um,
and it's,

93
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,780
it becomes that much more difficult than
to,

94
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,750
to really raise the type of political
will necessary to get things done in

95
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:51,880
this country on issues like climate
change,

96
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,860
immigration,
social security,

97
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,150
uh,
healthcare.

98
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,160
Uh,
you name the public problem.
