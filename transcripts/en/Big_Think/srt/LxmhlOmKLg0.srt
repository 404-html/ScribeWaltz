1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,360
Do you have a witness protection
program?

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,090
Can you provide me with a couple of big
guys?

3
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:17,860
I can keep an eye on me after that.
Uh,

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,090
you know,
I,

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,380
I honestly don't.
I think one has to say honestly that for

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,440
anyone to go into the poetry business,
one has to respect the fact that they're

7
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:32,210
trying to do at all,
you know,

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,790
so I,
I would just,

9
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:38,390
I think it'd be,
I wouldn't be interested in,

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,590
um,
I'm mean,

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,170
apart from the fact that you know,
it,

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,570
it would not be politically smart.
Have someone who has a certain,

13
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:51,710
you know,
as an editor of the New Yorker,

14
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,310
probably inappropriate for me to say I
hit so and so.

15
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,190
The fact of the matter is that there is
no one I had.

16
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,910
I'm really open to the.
I'm really open to the possibility that

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,070
a great poem will come down the pike
from anywhere.

18
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:15,130
I really am innocent and it's at a,
it's a fact of life that they do,

19
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,340
that they do and it's a fact of life
that,

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,800
for example,
writers,

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,180
um,
who often may not have been able to,

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,000
you know,
produce simply adding work.

23
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,990
Actually one day will,
uh,

24
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,150
so no one and that goes from students.
No one does not write off anyone and

25
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:42,080
that's largely because,
apart from anything else

26
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,770
on a good day,
ideally it's not even they're doing,

27
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,460
it's not the doing of the person when
the only when the person I deeply,

28
00:01:55,671 --> 00:02:00,671
deeply believe only when the person has
given herself or himself over to the

29
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:06,821
idea that they're in part and writing a
poem is actually quite small,

30
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,810
but they have to apply for something
beyond themselves to happen.

31
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,230
And we know that experience.
We know that experience from,

32
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,020
you know,
even if we're reading a letter we wrote

33
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,660
six months ago,
nevermind,

34
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,200
um,
know a paper one road at college and you

35
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:29,690
look at it new thing,
who wrote that?

36
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,300
Did I write that now?
Couldn't have,

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,840
couldn't have been me who wrote there.
That's,

38
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,840
you know,
too smart.

39
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:39,080
It's too good.
It's due to flirt to whatever,

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,160
and it's that sense actually,
that one is taken over by something

41
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,910
ideally that,
uh,

42
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:53,090
that one must never lose sight of.
So I,

43
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:54,940
you know,
I don't,

44
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,860
I really,
I,

45
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:58,820
I'm,
I'm interested in poetry and many,

46
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,610
many,
many manifestations,

47
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,940
many manifestations.
So I,

48
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:07,340
I really don't.
Just thinking here,

49
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,220
honestly,
I wouldn't,

50
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:10,600
I wouldn't be done too much.
