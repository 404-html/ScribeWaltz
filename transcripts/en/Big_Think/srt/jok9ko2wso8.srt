1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,760
My name is Eric Hippeau,
I'm a venture capitalists.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:08,150
My firm is called Larry Hippeau ventures
where it's me plus three other partners.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,140
We are technology investors.
So we look for companies that use

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,770
technology,
primarily consumer technology.

5
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:19,410
It doesn't mean that they have to be
consumer facing,

6
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:23,370
but the technology has to be based on
the same technology that we all use day

7
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:24,830
to day.
Uh,

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,790
and so we're looking for companies that
use technology to either create large

9
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:33,120
new marketplaces or large new
businesses,

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,190
uh,
or who disrupt a large businesses that

11
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:40,240
are already in place.
Um,

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,320
and New York is particularly well suited
for this because there's a lot of people

13
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:49,620
with very diverse backgrounds,
diverse domain knowledge.

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,890
Uh,
we have a lot of people in the,

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,710
in our educational system,
a million kids in our public school

16
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:58,680
system,
$600,000 car students,

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,820
um,
and technology today is primarily

18
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:05,220
developed in large urban centers.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,740
So obviously New York is well positioned
for that.

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,870
The,
the difference between New York and

21
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:14,871
Silicon Valley is in the kind of
technology that people that we develop

22
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:18,780
here as opposed to in Silicon Valley
first.

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,040
I think we should point out where the
similarities are and the similarities

24
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:28,041
are that because technology today is
transportable and rentable and

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,710
relatively cheap,
uh,

26
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,440
to,
uh,

27
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,820
to use,
uh,

28
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,650
we in New York,
but it could be anywhere,

29
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:36,840
it could be Bombay,
could be Austin,

30
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,280
have access to the same technology to
develop new applications,

31
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:44,460
new services than anybody in Silicon
Valley.

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,660
So everyone starts with the same level
playing field.

33
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,520
The technology is accessible through the
cloud.

34
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,760
It's rentable through the cloud.
Anybody can start a company with a

35
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,800
couple of,
of,

36
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,400
of,
of laptops and a two or three people and

37
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,680
you have an,
a few thousand dollars literally,

38
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,050
and you can start a company and you can
start a business.

39
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:09,230
So it's very different today than it was
just a few years ago where a large part

40
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:14,010
of the money that you raised actually
went to the acquisition of the

41
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:16,170
technology.
You had to buy servers and you have to

42
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:18,870
buy hardware,
you had to buy expensive software

43
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:21,780
licenses.
And today you don't have to do any of

44
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:23,400
that.
So that's a big difference.

45
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:24,234
But,
um,

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,570
we,
we have in New York as,

47
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:27,404
as,
as,

48
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,630
as anywhere else access to the same
latest developments in technology than

49
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:37,290
anybody in Silicon Valley.
The big differences that New York

50
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,450
focuses more on the software layer,
on the application and the services

51
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:43,800
layer.
Um,

52
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,990
so that we're really good at software,
New York.

53
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:46,591
We,
we,

54
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:47,660
uh,
we're good at,

55
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,590
um,
at platforms.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,840
We're good at consumer facing
application.

57
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:53,440
We're good at,
um,

58
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,130
enterprise software,
software as a service.

59
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,400
We're good at a variety of different
domains,

60
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,900
obviously are the ones that you can
think of the traditional sectors such as

61
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,990
advertising and media and uh,
but also healthcare and a variety of

62
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:16,981
different domains where you have people
who have experience and expertise,

63
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,220
uh,
because they know some big companies are

64
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:25,000
located here and big sectors of the
economy or are based here.

65
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,710
What New York,
um,

66
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,840
it's probably not going to do is develop
the next plumbing for the Internet.

67
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,640
That's more likely to be a coming out of
the west coast.

68
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:40,360
But having said that,
we're increasingly getting more and more

69
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:43,840
advanced engineering talent are in New
York.

70
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:44,950
In fact,
uh,

71
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,180
on Roosevelt Island,
uh,

72
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,870
there's going to be a cornell university
in,

73
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:54,871
in conjunction with the big technology
institute in Israel are building a

74
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:59,590
campus and which will be ready in two or
three years,

75
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:03,880
but the classes have already started in
other locations and this is all going to

76
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:08,140
be advanced applied engineering.
So who knows what's going to develop in

77
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:11,140
the future.
Some hardware is already being developed

78
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:12,760
in New York.
We invest investors,

79
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:13,930
for instance,
in Makerbot,

80
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,740
the three d printer company that was
sold recently to,

81
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:18,574
um,
um,

82
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,710
another three d printer company.
So,

83
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,510
uh,
so there is a,

84
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,540
there is a background in,
in hardware and manufacturing in New

85
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,920
York,
but generally speaking,

86
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:31,690
it's really software that's,
um,

87
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,900
that's the,
the big thing as it were healing.
