1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,250
The short answer I would say is anyone.
But the real answer I think is almost

2
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:10,510
anyone.
Um,

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,010
I am very comfortable with the system
that for a very acute period of time

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,530
protects people from their own worst
instincts.

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,450
But I do mean a very acute period of
time.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,230
I think the power dogmatic and Campbell,
if someone you might want to prevent

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,070
from committing suicide is the teenager
who breaks up with a boyfriend or

8
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:31,150
girlfriend and tries to overdose on
tylenol and to tell them for a few days

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,130
we're going to hospitalize you against
your will.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,780
Listen,
see men unreasonable to me.

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,660
In contrast,
someone who has suffered from chronic

12
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:40,960
depression throughout their life with
multiple suicide attempts.

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,900
Clearly modern medicine,
modern psychiatry has been unable to

14
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:44,990
help this person.
Um,

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,120
while I wouldn't necessarily choose to
end my life under those circumstances,

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,160
I be respect someone else's right to do
so.

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,390
So the real standard I would use is does
this person on the one hand have

18
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:57,940
capacity to make this decision?
Are they thinking clearly?

19
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,010
Are they thinking rationally?
And secondly,

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,790
can they demonstrate this capacity over
a prolonged period of several days

21
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,210
rather than being in an instant?
And I think the vast majority of people

22
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,140
who wish to commit suicide wouldn't eat
most of the both of those criteria.
