1
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,090
When we were in Afghanistan,
there was a warlord who was 14 years old

2
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:22,990
and he had just taken over his,
uh,

3
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,010
his villages from his father who had
been killed,

4
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,780
uh,
just a couple of weeks before we met

5
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:31,030
him.
And he's in a very remote region,

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,480
just south of the instrument pass,
whether it was a dividing a range,

7
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,700
um,
between those Taliban held a series of

8
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:44,560
hills that were Taliban held in a series
of hills that were held by his villages.

9
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,320
And he took us up to the place where his
father had been sniped and well made it

10
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:54,700
a big point of pride to stand at the top
of the mountain where his father had

11
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:58,780
been shot a couple of weeks ago and sort
of almost daring the Taliban who were

12
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:00,480
shooting at us from the,
uh,

13
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,620
from the opposing hillside.
You know,

14
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:04,360
we were sort of ducking and covering.

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,210
But you know,
this young 14 year old wanted to show us

16
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:10,510
that he wasn't afraid to stand in the
exact spot where his father had been

17
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:12,040
killed.
And,

18
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,620
uh,
and of course the only way to get up

19
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:15,120
there,
it was on,

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,830
on horseback and I'm new equestrian,
but,

21
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,380
uh,
I was able to sort of hang onto this

22
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:25,381
horse photographers with is a Irish.
I'm a photographer,

23
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,940
was,
uh,

24
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,480
unable to ride a horse,
so he was on a donkey and,

25
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:33,640
um,
and it was terrifying.

26
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,220
It was funny because I was watching him
on a document.

27
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,600
It's terrifying because they were
shooting at us and he was a [inaudible]

28
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,190
name is seamus,
and he's a fantastic photographer who

29
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:46,140
later became a great equestrian because
he learned his lesson and Afghan.
