1
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,980
A couple of christmases ago,
I got this,

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:15,060
this gift from one of our distributors
who sold me a.

3
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,140
It still sells us these incredible oils
from France,

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,970
from Burgundy,
and the maker is incredibly expensive.

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,580
It's this guy's so artism like he does
it in his garage behind his house.

6
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:31,930
He knows guys like another Wackadoo and
so he,

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,520
the Frenchman,
the artisanal producers,

8
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:37,640
Jeanmarc Montonya,
he gave the distributor Olivia a

9
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:41,690
president for us because we were the
biggest customer and his first,

10
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:45,760
I think one of his first and he gave us
a gift for Christmas.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,220
Olivia handed to me and I open the box
and it's,

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,150
it's this box of,
of dust.

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,220
It smells a little bit like nuts.
It's just dust.

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,330
I was like,
you,

15
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,710
what the hell is it?
So Olivia says,

16
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,601
I'll live a,
you know,

17
00:00:56,601 --> 00:01:00,710
John Mark wanted to give you a after he
a president that,

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,660
that have have nut dust.

19
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,750
It's basically after he presses the nuts
for his oil,

20
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:07,490
he has all this residue,
right?

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,320
So he said,
Olivia said,

22
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:12,650
you know,
last year I went over to to burgundy and

23
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:16,820
I had lunch with Sean Mark.
And as I opened the door to go into his

24
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:18,180
kitchen,
he was there on the stove,

25
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:22,010
saw tank potatoes and um,
and we sat down to,

26
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,270
to a salad and,
and a little like fried potatoes,

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,990
potatoes.
But Olivia said all he could taste from

28
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:30,950
the salads,
potatoes,

29
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,840
all I could taste,
we're Ahmed's.

30
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,450
He didn't see any artist.
He just smelled this overwhelming thing

31
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,940
was he thought like there was some kind
of almond souffle coming for dessert or

32
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:39,060
something.
And there's no honest to fly.

33
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,650
So he asked,
he asked mark,

34
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,151
he said,
mark,

35
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:42,290
you know,
it's delicious.

36
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,710
Meal tasting is Ahmed.
And John Mark said,

37
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,750
okay.
So after I pressed the,

38
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,260
the,
the almonds,

39
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:49,370
I have this residue,
this,

40
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:50,970
this,
this dust is not that.

41
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,720
Instead of throwing it out,
I throw it onto my potato fields

42
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,900
and a lot of it on my potato fields.
And through this incredible process of

43
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,370
Osmosis,
you know,

44
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,140
he gets almond potatoes,
right?

45
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,510
So I thought,
so he's telling me this and I'm looking

46
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:06,500
at my box.
I was just like,

47
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,330
this is the secret to,
you know,

48
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,470
my millions,
right?

49
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,710
So I take the stuff and I called a nut
company out in California and organic

50
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:18,050
and that company asked them for like 500
pounds of,

51
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,540
of,
of I thought pine nuts because I thought

52
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,300
I could one up.
I'm like,

53
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,580
I started to get competitive with this
guy.

54
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:24,770
I don't even know who gave me a gift
pine that we did.

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,221
We did.
Um,

56
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:28,260
and again we did walnut.
We got all these nuts and,

57
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,260
and jack spread them on carrots.
I didn't want to do it with potatoes

58
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:34,490
because I thought it'd be too much
capacity.

59
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,890
Carrots and we have a lot of carrots
during the winter.

60
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:37,970
So we spread,
spread,

61
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:38,481
spread,
spread,

62
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:39,590
spread.
Meanwhile,

63
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,640
I decided,
you know,

64
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,570
with my brother,
we're going to make some.

65
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,790
I do like this special night.
We know when the harvest is coming seven

66
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,410
weeks after the plants and to say,
okay,

67
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,050
let gonna do a harvest night and we're
going to do an,

68
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,060
you know,
an almond carrot night because we

69
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:54,460
figured that would be the one that
worked the pestle.

70
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,520
Almond carrot night.
We invite the whole dining rooms packed

71
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:01,270
with people who are excited about when
we sent out this email,

72
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,300
we talk to people for months and months.
We get the waiter's all jazzed up on

73
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:05,021
this thing.
I mean,

74
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:06,790
everybody was,
did the coat check,

75
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,160
the valets.
Everybody was the cooks era was talking

76
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:12,190
about it.
So the day of the dinner comes right and

77
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,710
uh,
and the harvest for someone who came in

78
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:18,790
really late that afternoon and I hadn't
actually really tasted the carrot,

79
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,820
you know,
so it's like 4:30 and I'm bored sitting

80
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:25,690
there cleaning carrots and like I
started to taste them and right as I'm

81
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:26,810
tasting them again and you know,
too,

82
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,500
too much to believe,
like the tickets are coming in,

83
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,910
you know,
it's like five,

84
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,020
um,
and carrot salad,

85
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:33,450
six Almond Garrett's salads,
you know,

86
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,680
double order obamacare.

87
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,490
It's out.
And I take a bite of the carrots,

88
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,380
no almond flavor,
nothing.

89
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,670
Zero,
Zilch.

90
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,930
It doesn't even taste like there's a
potential for almond in the future.

91
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:46,210
There's nothing.
It's a delicious carrot.

92
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,130
No.
Ahmed total failure.

93
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,680
So I sliced the carrots are like all of
a sudden tickets are coming in and

94
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:56,230
coming in like a 30 tickets on the board
and like 500 almond south.

95
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,870
And so I started slicing the carrots
really quickly,

96
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,950
salt,
pepper,

97
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:02,260
lemon vinegarette and I reached for John
Marks,

98
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,440
almond oil,
of which I have a few extra bottles and

99
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:09,370
I start dousing it with almond oil and I
mix it and then I give it to the waiters

100
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:10,960
just to taste before they go out the
dining room.

101
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,890
Genius man,
it tastes like,

102
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,270
um,
it's,

103
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,600
it's unbelievable.
It's fucking damn is a genius,

104
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,910
you know.
So that night we sell 120 carat salads

105
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,720
and it is the greatest success in the,
his is the best night we've ever had at

106
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,480
Blue Hill.

107
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,570
Every episode I ever had any restaurant
people wrote emails.

108
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:30,610
It's still talk about it.
It was still talking about it.

109
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:33,130
People say it's the most exciting and
most delicious,

110
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,620
you know,
experience I've ever had in a

111
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:37,360
restaurant.
There was a buzz in the diag,

112
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,630
never had.
And what I realized at the end of the

113
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,780
night in the mayhem of plating all these
salads,

114
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:48,490
I mean it was crazy night,
I forgot to put the almond oil in the,

115
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,230
in the carrots I did on some,
but I didn't on a lot and it did not

116
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:55,180
matter.
It absolutely did not matter.

117
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,560
People taste it.
Almonds,

118
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:59,900
because you told them the story and they
tasted the most delicious character

119
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,860
their life because they had this funny
story that they felt invested in and

120
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,770
they felt a part of and they wanted to
be connected to.

121
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,550
I think we're hardwired for this mess.

122
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,460
My ultimate theory is like,
you know,

123
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:12,730
as hunter gatherers,
we were spending our time figuring out

124
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:14,020
is that thing poisonous,
that thing,

125
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:15,820
delicious.
Well that thing feed our children,

126
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:17,020
you know,
it is that thing,

127
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:18,160
nutritious,
that kind of thing.

128
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,200
And I don't think that's been bred out
of us,

129
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:22,780
you know?
So when someone gives you a story of

130
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,760
this kind of thing,
like it,

131
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,470
it informs us and relaxes us,
relate to taste,

132
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,030
things that we otherwise wouldn't taste.
So that's my,

133
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,430
you know,
that we have so many stories like that

134
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,530
that just like it teaches me again and
again,

135
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:34,600
you have a story,
you have delicious food,

136
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,070
you know,
as long as you really don't screw it up,

137
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:37,430
you have malicious.
So there you go.
