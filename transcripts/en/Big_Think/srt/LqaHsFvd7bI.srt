1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,510
To war
again,

2
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:10,740
when I was listening to a talk earlier
today,

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,270
which,

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,820
uh,
talked about lifting a Edr men out of

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,220
Oregon,
MDA and placing them somewhere else,

6
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:17,940
and,
and,

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,760
uh,
and uh,

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,360
without destroying the whole country,
I mean a way of ways of neutralizing

9
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:26,370
dictators that,
uh,

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,530
are,
uh,

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,610
less or that are more humane and less
destructive than just an all out war on

12
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:34,550
the country.
Uh,

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,580
I think I'm a leader that would have a
more inventive sense of strategies

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,710
because we need some new paradigm.
I mean,

15
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:47,310
war is sort of an,
it should be.

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,860
We should be over that,
that,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
that old paradigm of just throwing our
youngest people into this.

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,640
The face of danger.
