1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,720
I am a middle school student from
Washington state,

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,410
as you already know,
our environment is threatened by human

3
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:15,240
right now and it's time to make a
change,

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,040
but a lot of people don't see this rack
or they don't want to make a change.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,700
The question is,
how can we get to influence human to

6
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:26,910
protect the planet in order,
something important actions we can do

7
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:29,670
starting right now to save the world.
I know it's hard,

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,860
but I just hope that you could give me
some clue.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,143
Thank you very much.

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,820
Victoria.
Victoria,

11
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:36,260
you are,
uh,

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,880
the key to the future,
my friend.

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,020
So here's the thing,
you're living in Washington state.

14
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:44,210
You know,
I lived in Seattle for many years.

15
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,740
I love Washington.
Go seahawks.

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,730
I'm right there,
my friend.

17
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,930
Go Mariners.
Now you are in middle school.

18
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the future.
People will tell you that,

19
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:58,001
but they're not kidding.
So what we want you to do is influence

20
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:03,851
your parents and make sure they vote.
Voting is the most important thing for

21
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:07,130
us,
especially this year.

22
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,110
And I want your parents.
I want you to encourage your parents to

23
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:16,730
take the environment into account when
they picked people to vote for.

24
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,020
Now you're a governor.
Jay inslee's,

25
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,430
an acquaintance of mine,
and he's a big environmental issue and

26
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:26,270
he wrote a book Apollo's fire and so on.
It's about the future,

27
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:31,271
but people are doing to take care of the
environment and have energy produced

28
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:35,750
electricity,
especially renewably without having to

29
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:37,130
burn fossil fuels.

30
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,490
So it's,
it's up to you to influence your

31
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:41,540
parents.
Yes,

32
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,130
very important to recycle your plastic
and your paper.

33
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,310
Very important to uh,
and also in Washington state.

34
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:52,610
I'm not sure exactly where you live,
but you can recycle your food waste

35
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:55,370
along with your yard waste.
And that becomes compost,

36
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,710
which nurses nourishes our farms,
which in turn produces food part of the

37
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,720
mythic cycle of life.
So you can encourage your parents to do

38
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:08,750
that,
but we need big ideas,

39
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,590
big changes we need in Washington state.
There's enormous opportunities for wind,

40
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:18,920
turbans and enormous opportunities for
photovoltaics,

41
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:22,250
for solar cells that takes sunlight and
make it right into electricity,

42
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,690
especially in eastern Washington.
So you can be part of that and you're in

43
00:02:26,691 --> 00:02:29,690
middle school,
there was a turning point for most

44
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:34,100
people in their science education.
So I hope you Victoria will apply

45
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:37,520
yourself in science class and biology,
physics,

46
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:39,740
chemistry,
and there's probably another class you

47
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:43,340
might have about a planetary science or
astronomy and earth science.

48
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,160
And the other thing Victoria is really
important,

49
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:51,161
especially for girls is Algebra a and I
just want to tell you Algebra is this,

50
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,470
this way to think.
It trains your brain to think in this

51
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:06,511
way that enables you to imagine
to imagine things to,

52
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,610
to accept that you don't know the
answer,

53
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:12,040
but you're going to find it.
And so,

54
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,200
um,
I really encourage you,

55
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,350
I just tell you that I took Algebra.
You just have to practice.

56
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:20,710
There's no way around it.
You just gotTa do it over and over to

57
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:23,620
you to get comfortable with it.
And you can do it.

58
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,930
And by the way,
when you're a girl

59
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,240
in middle school,
you're kind of better at everything than

60
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:34,450
the boys.
Now that'll change in the next four or

61
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:35,790
five years.
I mean,

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,260
you'll even out,
but right now,

63
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,270
just go with it,
my friend.

64
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,610
Go with it.
Make sure you learn Algebra and learn

65
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:45,970
science so that you,
if you choose to be a scientist or

66
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:50,380
better yet an engineer,
which is a profession in which you use

67
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:55,381
science to solve problems and make
things that you can lead the world in

68
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:57,580
these new technologies,
but right now,

69
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,820
uh,
do those things at home that make that,

70
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:04,720
make an important difference at home
recycling and not wasting energy,

71
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:08,140
not wasting clean water.
And make sure your parents take the

72
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:11,020
environment into account and make sure
they vote.

73
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,680
Thank you Victoria.
Go get them.
