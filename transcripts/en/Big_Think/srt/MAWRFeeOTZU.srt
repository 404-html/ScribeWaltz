1
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,810
Diversity and in any intellectual
organization,

2
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:18,520
I mean that's how good ideas arise.
They have to do battle with less good

3
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:23,521
ideas if to the extent that everybody is
accepting roughly the same paradigms for

4
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,990
inquiry and there are certain
expectations about what counts as good

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,580
results of your research.
That's not very good for diversity and

6
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:35,980
it's not very good for intellectual
ferment,

7
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:37,800
which is what you want to encourage.
I mean,

8
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,840
universities are set up to get people to
work together by having them disagree

9
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:44,410
with each other,
so what are the difficulties with the

10
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:49,650
relative homogeneity of opinion among
professors is I happened to be at the

11
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:52,750
same opinion as most professors.
Most professors are kind of Liberal

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,780
Democrats.
It's just that it discourages people

13
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:58,750
from getting into the profession,
which is very difficult to get into

14
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,820
anyway because they feel are there going
to be discriminated against or Sean or

15
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:05,680
just not included in the conversation?

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,960
I don't think that's necessarily would
be the case,

17
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:11,590
but it's discouraging to people
basically what you want in any

18
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:13,840
profession.
I would say the same thing if I were a

19
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:18,010
lawyer or a doctor is you want bright
undergraduates to look at your

20
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,820
profession as something they would be
interested in getting into if the

21
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:26,821
barriers to entry are really high and
there seems to be some requirement that

22
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:30,100
you tailor your views to fit the views
of your colleagues.

23
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:32,680
It's going to discourage people from
entering it and they'll go do something

24
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:33,960
else that's got a,
you know,

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,120
more reliable track to a career.
So I do worry a lot about the time it

26
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:42,940
takes for people to get a phd about the
difficulty of finding employment,

27
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:47,620
about the difficulty of getting tenure
and generally about the perception that

28
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:51,220
undergraduates have that this is a very
high risk career to get started.

29
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,680
I don't want people to feel that.
I want people to feel this is something

30
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,120
that we fund to do and doable.

31
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,970
Well,
I think,

32
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,020
I mean there are lots of ways in which
universities will never be a reflection

33
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:07,970
of the general opinion of the public and
they probably shouldn't be.

34
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,740
It's generally sort of sociologically
observed that the better educated people

35
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:14,120
are,
the more liberal they tend to be,

36
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:16,970
which would suggest that professors are
going to be more liberal than the

37
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,150
general public.
And I don't think that you want to see,

38
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,630
um,
universities in any way trying to have

39
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:26,690
any kind of quota system about political
views or views in general.

40
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,930
You want the market to work in the way
the market works.

41
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,780
Um,
but I think that one of the things that

42
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:36,770
would make it a little bit more likely
to get diversity into,

43
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,420
I would just say to oxygenate the system
that we're working in would be to make a

44
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:43,430
little easier to get a phd.
Um,

45
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,070
sometimes I think we should just give
more phds,

46
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:48,410
but even if we didn't get more phds,
if we just didn't,

47
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,990
if we didn't make it eight or nine or 10
years to get a Phd,

48
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:55,940
I think it would encourage people to
enter who would otherwise find lots of

49
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:57,770
reasons why it wasn't a very wise thing
to do.
