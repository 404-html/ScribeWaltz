1
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,730
Was Obama's postpartum and agenda is
that he came into it,

2
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:16,990
he came into his presidency,
uh,

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,490
at a time when millions of Americans,
perhaps even tens of millions of

4
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:24,330
Americans,
don't consider a Democrat president

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,850
legitimate,
don't get sued of liberalism,

6
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:31,080
legitimate dunk.
Consider the idea of the state for my

7
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:34,740
new programs to help people legitimate.
Uh,

8
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:36,580
so he's in a situation,
a lot like a,

9
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:38,790
you know,
Abraham Lincoln face in 1860,

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,150
when you had millions of Americans who
didn't even consider what was going on

11
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:44,850
in Washington to have anything to do
with them.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,160
So,
uh,

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,430
the big question for me was always was
this post partisan idea,

14
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:54,480
this idea that you could kind of bring
adversaries across the table and get

15
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:57,420
them to agree to each other and agree
with to get them to agree with each

16
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:59,970
other and uh,
achieve social progress.

17
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,160
Was that a deep seated belief of his or
was that in a certain sense,

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,090
a tactic?

19
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,860
Not as cynical tactic,
but a tactic?

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,140
And,
uh,

21
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,290
I would be very with him if it were a
way of thinking about politics,

22
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:19,260
if it were a tactic.
Because the job of a transformative

23
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:24,261
leader is not too huge the center,
but to define their own values as the

24
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:28,250
center as commonsense.
And,

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,160
uh,
if he,

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,690
you know,
I,

27
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,620
I believe in the agenda he's passed,
he's,

28
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:32,970
he's putting far,
for example,

29
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:34,620
universal healthcare,
you know,

30
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:35,730
for example,
uh,

31
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,700
you know,
cap and trade and green jobs as a way to

32
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,850
solve our energy problems while growing
the economy.

33
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,820
I think these are reasonable,
uh,

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,480
while liberal goals and,
uh,

35
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,230
if he presents them as reasonable and
the reaction to them as one could knew

36
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:56,850
they were going to be,
because there are these millions of

37
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:59,880
people who don't consider a liberal
president.

38
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,090
Legitimate was irrational extreme that
presented him an opportunity to say,

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,840
my program is rational,
but my opposition has chosen extremism,

40
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,460
has chosen unreasoned and be willing to
take the hit that there's always going

41
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:24,420
to be a minority of the country.

42
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,120
30%,
35%,

43
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,540
even 40% who disagrees with him
radically disagrees with him strongly.

44
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,040
But if he's still willing to pass his
program with debt,

45
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,400
60% margin,
the rest of the country will eventually

46
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:43,420
catch up.
The reaction.

47
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:48,000
Notice we'll understand as they did with
social security as they did with,

48
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,290
you know,
women getting the vote,

49
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,200
freeing the slaves,
you know,

50
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:56,520
a social security that actually these
things were in their interests.

51
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,680
They'll accept them as part of the
established order of American society.

52
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,670
And in fact,
20,

53
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:01,331
30,
40,

54
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:02,770
down years,
years down the road,

55
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,010
the Republicans and the Conservatives
will be campaigning to see if universal

56
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:10,540
health care,
just like they can't paint to save

57
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,510
social security.
But the problem is this doesn't really

58
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:16,840
work unless you make this kind of
tactical shift.

59
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,470
If people say that you're illegitimate
and,

60
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,840
uh,
your liberal agenda is extremist

61
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,670
socialist,
uh,

62
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,950
destroying the America that we all grew
up with.

63
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,190
You have to be willing to say this is
unreasonable.

64
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,040
This is extreme.
And if you aren't able to say this is

65
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:38,050
unreasonable and this is extreme,
then you're granting your opposition,

66
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,410
uh,
an undue influence.

67
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,180
You're basically,
uh,

68
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,250
negotiating with the under negotiate
bubble.

69
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,970
And,
uh,

70
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,030
as Abraham Lincoln said quite eloquently
in his 1860 speech at Cooper Union,

71
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,470
uh,
you can't win that way.

72
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,580
I've been saying for years that,
uh,

73
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,890
you know,
there are millions of Americans who

74
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:05,970
basically don't consider,
uh,

75
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,290
the liberal project legitimate.
They consider it the opposite of what

76
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,260
America means to them and,
uh,

77
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,320
that they derive their identity from
questioning the legitimacy and the

78
00:04:18,111 --> 00:04:22,130
ability of the liberal government to,
to function peacefully.

79
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,870
So,
uh,

80
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,380
I think that for a couple months,
uh,

81
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,050
even more maybe six months,
uh,

82
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:33,110
Barack Obama's charisma and his,
uh,

83
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,220
his remarkable popularity,
uh,

84
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,780
kind of stunned some of these people
into silence.

85
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,720
I think people couldn't quite believe
what they're saying.

86
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,270
But if you,
if you,

87
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,930
if you,
if you look at it historically,

88
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:45,620
it's,
you know,

89
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,090
quite continuous with what happened when
Bill Clinton became president.

90
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,340
You know,
when you began to hear people,

91
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,050
you know,
a accusing him of,

92
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:54,710
uh,
you know,

93
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,660
murdering his aids.
You know,

94
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,110
when you began to have,
uh,

95
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:58,970
people,
uh,

96
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,290
saying that he was actually,
uh,

97
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,080
you know,
ancient for a,

98
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,130
the Soviet Union,
which he had visited when he was a

99
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:06,140
child,
or when he was a teenager,

100
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:07,250
when he was in college.

101
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,610
And you saw the same thing when Jimmy
Carter became president.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,670
And,
uh,

103
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,000
you know,
um,

104
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,630
he was immediately considered a part of
this,

105
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,110
uh,
corrupt Democratic Party establishment.

106
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,650
Uh,
it happened every time a Democrat was

107
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:26,090
elected in,
it will happen.

108
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:28,460
Every time a Democrat is elected.
It's,

109
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,800
it's,
it's part of our patrimony as Americans.

110
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,160
And the challenge for a Barack Obama or
any democrat or any liberal is to

111
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:40,790
understand that this is just part of who
we are as Americans.

112
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,340
To acknowledge it,
to respect it,

113
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,220
and to transcend it.
And,

114
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,510
uh,
you know,

115
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,960
uh,
the lion can lay down with the lamb,

116
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,030
but it's not going to last for very
long.
