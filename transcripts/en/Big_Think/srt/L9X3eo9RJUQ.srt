1
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,480
Spiritualities to experience

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,570
awareness,
which is universal,

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,080
and when we experienced that domain of
awareness,

4
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:20,160
which is beyond our skin and capsulated
eagle identities,

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,760
then we have the spontaneous
understanding of love,

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,060
compassion,
uh,

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,900
it becomes our nature not as a moral
dictate,

8
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:34,140
but something which is a natural
expression of ourselves.

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,770
It also gives us insight into the
mechanics of how intention orchestrates

10
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:44,090
its own fulfillment.
Spiritualities,

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,460
also a sense of connection with the
creative power of the universe,

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,880
the mystery that we call God a,
and by having a sense of connection to

13
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:58,491
that greater power,
we gain self esteem and have the ability

14
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:03,501
to create because we align ourselves
with the elements and forces of creative

15
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:08,040
universe.
We begin to realize that the universe is

16
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,410
creative,
that is conscious,

17
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,750
that it's evolving and our personal
evolution is somehow linked to the

18
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:18,300
evolution of the mystery that we call
them

19
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,180
experiential.
In

20
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,180
India it is trucked out to yoga,
but most people have a misunderstanding

21
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:35,060
of yoga.
They equate it with the physical

22
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:40,061
postures that they do in a yoga studio,
which are one component of yoga,

23
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,720
but yoga classically is divided into
four types and they have to do with four

24
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:53,831
basic instincts that human beings have,
being feeling,

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,550
thinking,
and doing.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,170
So the yoga of being his meditation,
self reflection,

27
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,530
um,
the ability to shut off the world of the

28
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:07,340
sentences and go to the source of our
own thought.

29
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,920
It's called Raja Yoga.
Uh,

30
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:15,070
the second yoga is the Yoga of love
through relationship and understanding

31
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:20,210
that love is a,
is the ultimate truth at the heart of

32
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:23,090
creation,
and that through relationship we can

33
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:27,260
move progressively from attraction to
infatuation,

34
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:29,930
to communion,
to intimacy,

35
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,660
to passion,
to detachment,

36
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:35,780
to ecstasy,
which is our ground state,

37
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,790
the exaltation of our spirit.

38
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:43,270
So love and relationship is a second
means of experiencing spirituality.

39
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,040
If somebody doesn't understand
spirituality,

40
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,300
ask them if they've ever been in love.
That's the experience of spirituality.

41
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,920
That third way of understanding yoga or
having the experience of spirit is

42
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:59,860
through service.
When you perform service without any

43
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:02,350
selfish motivation,
it's called Karma Yoga.

44
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,770
Then you also get in touch with the same
domain of awareness that we call spirit.

45
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,550
And the fourth way of understanding
spirituality is,

46
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,530
uh,
through the intellect,

47
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:15,910
through the mind,
through science,

48
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:18,970
to understanding how the laws of nature
work.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,570
Because the laws of nature are in fact
the mind.
