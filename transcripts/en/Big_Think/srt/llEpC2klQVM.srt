1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,250
It was founded in 2000.
Originally we had grade seven through

2
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:12,780
nine of for 200 students designed as a
college prep school.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,000
And uh,
in 19,

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,980
uh,
in 2005,

5
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:19,710
we expanded the school and move to a new
location.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,070
And so today we're serving a 1100
students in kindergarten through twelfth

7
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:30,801
grade and these are inner city kids.
I started teaching back in 1995 and did

8
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:36,450
that for five years in the urban core of
Kansas City.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,130
And then another fellow,
and I have also a former CEO got

10
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:43,710
together and decided to start our own
school.

11
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:47,550
And this was at the time when charter
schools were starting to take the

12
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:50,000
country by storm.
And uh,

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,180
uh,
so we,

14
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:53,850
uh,
did some planning and sure enough we

15
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:57,510
were able to
give birth to a school.
