1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,140
Is
a conventional wisdom kind of idea?

2
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,790
This is like the greatest period of
technological change in history

3
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,580
and certainly by some measures,
there have been immense changes that are

4
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:26,670
hard to imagine.

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,500
Uh,
uh,

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,400
having been matched in the past,
as we said earlier in this interview,

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,390
I don't know that there's been a period
of time when people have so rapidly

8
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:41,391
gained access to so much information.
But there've been other big eras where

9
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:47,150
technology change very fast to beginning
of the last century when the automobile,

10
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:49,380
the airplane,
the Telegraph,

11
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:51,270
all these things came along very
quickly.

12
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:52,200
The telephone,

13
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,370
uh,
uh,

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,960
even further back in history,
various developments in medicine and

15
00:00:58,961 --> 00:01:03,370
sanitation and other things that really
had huge outcomes in the way people

16
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:07,300
lived and worked.
And what gets me up every morning is

17
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:10,270
that I,
I am living in one of those periods.

18
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:13,120
Even if it's not,
it doesn't matter to me that it's the

19
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:17,920
biggest or the fastest or whatever.
It's one of those periods of amazing

20
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:19,960
technological change.
I,

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,200
I work for a publication that is
respected and that has resources for me

22
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:29,560
to cover these changes.
And I get to,

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,380
uh,
see a lot of these things,

24
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,680
not only early but in the context of how
they were developed.

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,020
The developers come,
uh,

26
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:41,350
they want me to write about it.
And so we have a conversation about why

27
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,150
didn't you do this?
How did you come to doing this?

28
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:45,850
What was your idea?
They love talking about it.

29
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,850
I love listening to it.
It also gives me a chance to meet a

30
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,290
important I people I think are important
historical figures the way that I used

31
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:59,130
to when I covered.
And I used to go to the White House

32
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,840
sites to go to the Kremlin.
I used to go to all these places,

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,600
10 Downing Street,
these various places.

34
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,640
Uh,
now I go to Google,

35
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,770
I go to Microsoft,
I go to apple.

36
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:10,140
I,
uh,

37
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,800
have spent many hours of conversation
over the years,

38
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,730
uh,
with people like Bill Gates and Steve

39
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,060
Jobs and the guys who founded Google and
uh,

40
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,850
Steve case who founded AOL and numerous
other people.

41
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:26,170
And so,
um,

42
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,130
I've learned a lot from that and I feel
like it must have been,

43
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:33,370
like,
it would've been like if you had sort of

44
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:38,371
modern journalism covering Henry Ford or
Thomas Edison or whatever.

45
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,070
So that gets me up in the morning.
It's fascinating.
