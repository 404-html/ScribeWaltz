1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,700
I'm a TV junkie,
so I like pictures.

2
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:05,190
I like images and radio doesn't have
that.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,030
Um,
which might initially seem weird,

4
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:11,280
but it's kind of a,
it's kind of ultimately the coolest

5
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:15,060
thing about radio is,
is what it lacks is somehow empowered by

6
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:16,410
it,
by the absence of pictures.

7
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:21,411
Because what that enables is the simple
act like I could describe something to

8
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:23,634
you,
you know,

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,880
um,
like when I walked up the stairs to come

10
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:27,870
into the studio,
you know,

11
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:32,871
the sun was out in the sun,
had this weird kind of pg white,

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,630
whew,
that was kind of like the color of a

13
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:38,190
fox,
his belly or something.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,240
Like you may be just imagine something,
right?

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,270
Um,
well think of what,

16
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:46,650
just what just happened.
They're like,

17
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:49,290
in a sense I'm painting something,
but I'm not holding the paintbrush.

18
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,760
You are.
Um,

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,920
so it's this deep act of coauthor ship
and in that is some potential for

20
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:56,400
empathy.

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,120
I think it's somehow we're doing it
together because we have to fill this

22
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:04,500
gap of picture listeners together.
We have to somehow be connected.

23
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,470
I love that about radio as much as I
want.

24
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:09,000
I mean,
I've watched so much tv,

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,630
it's kind of shocking.
But I love the,

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,050
the immediacy and the connection that
you can have with another person through

27
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:18,060
radio.
And I think it has something to do with

28
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:22,170
this co imagining that happens.
If,

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,840
if I do my job right,
then you,

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,840
if I can put certain images and feelings
into your head,

31
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:31,590
then I know we can connect.
No matter what you do to it.

32
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,270
You,
no matter what you want,

33
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:34,830
new techniques you inject.
I mean,

34
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,270
the power of this medium is rooted in
the human voice and the human voice has

35
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:42,420
so much information in it,
the vibrations of the voice,

36
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:46,890
the way the voice rises and falls,
the musicality of the human voice is,

37
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,180
um,
the engine of everything that we do.

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,600
So perhaps that's why radio never dies.
It's supposed to have died about 50

39
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:59,760
times right now.
And I'm sure it'll be declared dead 50

40
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:02,340
more times.
But there's something that happens when

41
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:04,770
you turn on the radio and someone's
talking to you and they're talking to

42
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:06,660
just you.
And,

43
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,550
um,
there's an immediacy and a,

44
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:12,120
in a,
in an intimacy that can happen that,

45
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,330
um,
I kind of feel inoculates this,

46
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,060
this technology from ever dying
least.

47
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,880
I hope so.
That's my bet.

48
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,200
Professionally speaking.
