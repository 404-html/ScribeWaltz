1
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,970
Oh,
I don't think judges at our level,

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:15,390
I don't think much about public,
I think the Supreme Court does because

3
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,080
you know,
it's interesting example of a couple of

4
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:20,914
years ago,
they,

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,160
the court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit,

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,930
which is California number.
Then western states decided that the

7
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:33,931
phrase under God in the pledge of
allegiance was unconstitutional and

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,030
that caused a certain sensation.
But on the other hand,

9
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:43,550
it was just the ninth circuit.
It was just the West in any way.

10
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:45,190
It was subject to appeal the Supreme
Court.

11
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,700
Will,
the supreme court found a technical

12
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:52,450
ground for reversing the decision they
didn't deal with.

13
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:56,710
The issues of religious freedom that are
involved was very technical.

14
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,250
Now,
if the Supreme Court decided under God

15
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:03,070
in the pledge of allegiance was
unconstitutional,

16
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:07,490
that would have a tremendous impact.
Uh,

17
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,820
and I,
I think the supreme court justice is

18
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:14,821
consciously or unconsciously
are mindful of the public opinion

19
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:17,800
consequences of their decision.

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,010
But at our level,
our decisions,

21
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:24,250
we rarely have significant effect on
public opinion.

22
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,290
So the response to the public is not,
is not a factor,

23
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:35,130
but on the other hand,
there's no doubt that judges idea

24
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:42,901
ideological views and political
responses and moral feelings and so on

25
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,210
are influenced by the,
uh,

26
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,070
the temper of the,
of the community.

27
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,980
So some of us think,
well,

28
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,030
we mean by morality is durable public
opinion,

29
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,420
right?
So the judges will share the morality of

30
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:05,680
their community,
which is ultimately a product of what

31
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:08,290
people feel.
So,

32
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,050
so public opinion has a tremendous
underground effect.

33
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,500
The courts are all more conservative,
for example,

34
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,300
than they were in the sixties.
So there's been an ideological drift in

35
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:25,570
the country
and

36
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,630
equivalently has been a change in public
opinion that's affected who's been

37
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:34,200
appointed as a judge but also affected
how.

38
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,010
How'd you.
