1
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,810
My opinion on the legalization of
marijuana is complicated because when we

2
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:18,380
think about a society in general,
if we think about these things,

3
00:00:18,381 --> 00:00:20,240
honestly,
every society has.

4
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:23,810
They're intoxicated,
we have alcohol,

5
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:27,080
that's our primary,
what we also have to mackle and we have

6
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:31,700
caffeine which is not as intoxicated.
Now the question becomes,

7
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:36,701
should we make another intoxicant legal
that we know all the problems that we

8
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:40,040
have with those with alcohol,
tobacco,

9
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,590
and caffeine,
we know the problems that we may have,

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,190
so that means if you have marijuana to
be more widely available,

11
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:48,980
you can also expect to maybe have some
more problems.

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,010
Some of those similar types of problems.
On the one hand,

13
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,210
on the other hand,
in New York City for example,

14
00:00:56,211 --> 00:01:01,211
we're arresting hundreds of thousands of
people every year for marijuana and they

15
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,830
have they as a result,
they have a record or they have some

16
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:11,831
sort of blemish and that might retard
their ability to make a contribution.

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,880
So we are also having some consequences
from our current legal status of the

18
00:01:19,341 --> 00:01:24,320
drug.
So the society has to balance what is

19
00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:29,321
more important to the society,
but they should do so with their eyes

20
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:33,290
open.
You will have problems either way,

21
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,620
but the point becomes which problems are
we willing to tolerate as a society on

22
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:43,880
the one hand,
now that's the legalization issue that

23
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:46,070
you're talking about.
That's more availability.

24
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,470
Now,
when we think about medical marijuana,

25
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,750
um,
the institute on medicine,

26
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,860
um,
did a report,

27
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,450
still tried to study this issue
comprehensively and suggested that we

28
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:03,830
should probably continue to investigate
therapeutic potential,

29
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,890
the therapeutic potential of marijuana
and that's clearly support that position

30
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,240
that we certainly need to,
if people are suffering and we have

31
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:17,300
potential medications that will help
relieve their suffering,

32
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,430
absolutely we should go full forth with
that and we should do it in a

33
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:24,760
responsible way in which,
uh,

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,780
in a similar way in which we look at,
uh,

35
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,470
in which we use drugs like morphine,
which is essentially heroin.

36
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,743
Um,
we,

37
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,350
we do that responsibly.
Um,

38
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,460
and we certainly do it in a restricted
and controlled manner.

39
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,290
And we should probably do the same with
marijuana.
