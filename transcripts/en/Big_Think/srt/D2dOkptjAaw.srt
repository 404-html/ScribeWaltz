1
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,970
As I said,
being at the bank,

2
00:00:09,971 --> 00:00:13,360
you're in an outpost where you see the
planet more clearly,

3
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:18,310
I think than in many other jobs almost
because of the design of the institution

4
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:22,090
and the nature of what it does.
And having been around,

5
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:24,940
uh,
many years at the high level,

6
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:28,360
I had I think more of a broad view than
most people have.

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,170
And when I was the European vice
president with Wolfenson,

8
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:37,171
we went all over the prime ministers in
the ministers and the g aids and the,

9
00:00:38,651 --> 00:00:41,350
uh,
European summits and so forth.

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,250
And at some point I had this feeling,
which I then wrote about that in a way.

11
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:53,770
Um,
there was no pilot in the cockpit on

12
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:58,771
many global issues that they were these
un summits and this ga declarations and

13
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:02,680
so forth.
But that in true fact,

14
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:07,450
many of the big global problems like
global warming being one where not being

15
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:10,300
actively solved by the international
system as we know it.

16
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:16,090
And so one day I,
I did something I did every year,

17
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:18,670
which was to take a week off to write a
major speech.

18
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,450
I sat down and wrote a speech about this
question of why they were some two dozen

19
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:30,961
issues that were not being solved deeply
enough and fast enough and why that was

20
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:36,130
and what we could do to accelerate this
global problem solving that seems to be

21
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:41,131
so slow to come by.
And that speech worked out fine.

22
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,370
And then there was an extraordinary
moment where,

23
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,950
uh,
Chancellor Schroder who was then

24
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:51,970
chancellor of Germany as the World Bank
for a briefing,

25
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,250
which is remarkable actually,
yes,

26
00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:56,980
to be briefed on poverty and development
issues.

27
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:03,330
And so we had a meeting with him in the
restaurant near Hanover on a Sunday.

28
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:05,420
I remember,
uh,

29
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,770
Wolfensohn Nick Stern,
who then wrote this famous climate

30
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:13,771
change report for the British government
later and myself and Chancellor Schroder

31
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:14,854
and two people.

32
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,910
And since I had organized the meeting,
I had kept one hour at the back of the

33
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:24,490
meeting for my ideas on global
governance and global issues.

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,340
And so Wolfensohn spoke for three or
four hours and poverty and development.

35
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:32,560
And then I started to talk about global
issues.

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,320
And Chancellor Schroder was very
interested,

37
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,520
and Jim Wolfensohn,
who was intrigued and interested as

38
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:42,910
well.
And in the evening when we had dinner

39
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:46,300
together after a successful day with
Chancellor Schroder,

40
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:49,750
I asked Wolfensohn what to do about it.
And he said,

41
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:51,730
these ideas go far beyond the World
Bank.

42
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:56,731
So write them up on under your own name.
And that led me to write the book,

43
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,920
which is a book that was critical of the
[inaudible] of the UN and so forth.

44
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,560
But somehow I got away with it a while
being in the institution as a sitting

45
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:13,561
vice president.
And that shows you one more time how a

46
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,900
open minded institution it was at the
time.

47
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,540
And I'm grateful for that.
And uh,

48
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,080
and then the book led into many speeches
and into a whole campaign on these

49
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,660
questions,
but that was the origin of it.
