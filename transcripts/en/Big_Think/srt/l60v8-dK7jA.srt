1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,800
Well,
there are a lot of flaws in the judicial

2
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:06,770
system.
I think we could probably do with that.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,380
Elections have judges,
uh,

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,380
uh,
that creates problems.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,070
Um,
I think that we could do a lot more to

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
educate the judiciary in terms of a
scientific evidence.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,530
We have a real problem there.
It's a increasingly scientific evidence

8
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,640
is becoming important in a whole host of
cases,

9
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:28,800
not just criminal cases.
Um,

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,780
and it's important that,
uh,

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,120
we have a certain level of scientific
literacy,

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,860
uh,
in the judiciary,

13
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:37,000
much less among lawyers.
Uh,

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,380
uh,
so I think those are two problems.

15
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,370
Um,
you know,

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,960
a psych at all of our politics,
uh,

17
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,060
money can make a real difference in
corrupting the process of judicial

18
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:51,930
elections.
So we've,

19
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,200
a,
John Grisham has written a wonderful

20
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:58,260
book about this called the appeal.
It's very quick reading,

21
00:00:58,261 --> 00:01:02,820
but it's a very troubling,
there've been a number of judicial

22
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:07,821
elections for highest appellate courts
in this country where moneyed interests

23
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,780
have been able to basically go after
certain judges.

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,640
They're really interested,
uh,

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,230
in their,
you know,

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,200
corporate cases,
uh,

27
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,850
uh,
or maybe some tort reform case,

28
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:24,480
but they're able to make some kind of
ruling in a criminal case or something

29
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:25,590
else.
Uh,

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,341
uh,
look,

31
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:28,740
very scary to the electorate.
And,

32
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:29,490
uh,
they,

33
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,720
all of a sudden outside money comes into
estate in an enormous amount.

34
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,943
And,
uh,

35
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,400
some campaign is run and judges are
defeated.

36
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,830
Happened to a fabulous judge in
Wisconsin.

37
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,610
Um,
uh,

38
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,730
it's happened all across the country and
the most famous instances,

39
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:51,900
one that the United States Supreme Court
looked into in West Virginia involving

40
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,020
the Massey Coal Company.
And that was the coal company where we

41
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:57,420
had that terrible accident in the minds
recently,

42
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,970
um,
where,

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,720
uh,
the head of that coal company,

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,960
I'm a put an enormous amount of money
into the judicial election for the West

45
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,430
Chester,
West Virginia Supreme Court.

46
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,300
Um,
and then the judge who was the

47
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:14,040
beneficiary of this,
uh,

48
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,290
uh,
you know,

49
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,280
sat on the case and,
uh,

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,640
the United States Supreme Court to
actually ruled in this,

51
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,840
uh,
case that,

52
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:22,531
uh,
that had,

53
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:24,780
uh,
an appearance of impropriety.

54
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:26,010
Uh,
we know when we see it.

55
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,080
And,
uh,

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,740
um,
uh,

57
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,970
reversed the decision in that case.
So,

58
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,820
um,
that's a remanded it for

59
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:35,330
reconsideration.
That's a very,

60
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,150
very extreme example,
but unfortunately I think a lot of that

61
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:41,700
is going around the country and that,
that,

62
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:42,480
uh,
uh,

63
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,030
I know that a Sandra Day O'connor,
for example,

64
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,640
feels very,
very strongly about

65
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,760
judicial elections being a real problem.
And there's probably a lot of different

66
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:56,700
kinds of merit systems,
uh,

67
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,980
that should be considered across the
country.
