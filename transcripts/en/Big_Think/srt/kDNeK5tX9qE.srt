1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,050
No.
The thing about monetary policy is just

2
00:00:14,051 --> 00:00:16,960
to get to your question about why asset
prices,

3
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:20,980
where the place where some of the
stresses took place,

4
00:00:20,981 --> 00:00:24,250
you never know exactly where the impact
will take place.

5
00:00:24,251 --> 00:00:26,440
Sometimes it's in broad measures of
inflation,

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,970
sometimes it's certain sectors.
First Energy has been a commonplace.

7
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:34,300
We're price pressures first build up.
In this case,

8
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:38,530
a lot of them were in the housing market
and I think that was because we already

9
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:40,270
had beginning of,
uh,

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,440
of uh,
housing,

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,540
uh,
boom going.

12
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:47,350
And so in a sense,
what the low interest rates did was

13
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:51,010
accelerate that.
Plus of course with the adjustable rate

14
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:55,390
mortgages around and available,
they'll very low interest rates enabled

15
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:59,380
there to be more teaser rates,
more very low starting rates.

16
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:02,260
And so that added to the housing boom
itself.

17
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,050
As you know,
during this period there was a big

18
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:09,460
increase in the fraction of mortgages
that came through the adjustable rate.

19
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,680
And so those,
those extra low interest rates affect

20
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,060
the things there.
But you also had a general increase in

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,790
inflation during this period.
It was creeping up,

22
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,230
uh,
each year,

23
00:01:20,231 --> 00:01:25,231
2000 to 2003,
2004 2005 and the and the acceleration

24
00:01:25,421 --> 00:01:27,940
of the housing boom was on top of that.

25
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,430
I think the distinction between price
level targeting and inflation targeting,

26
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,710
which has had a huge amount of attention
in the academic literature and has been

27
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:47,460
referred to in the past such as Ben
Bernanki before he became chairman.

28
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,350
I think those distinctions in practice
get blurred by the realities quite

29
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:54,870
frankly.
It of course would be good to have a

30
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:59,871
price level targeting other things equal
that would sometimes require deflation.

31
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,750
However,
and a lot of evidence is that that's not

32
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:05,940
such a good thing to have even
occasionally,

33
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,870
so I've always been of the view that
inflation target and it makes more

34
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:12,540
sense.
It's easier for people to understand.

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,140
We've had a lot of practice with it.
And while there is this problem of if

36
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:20,220
you like of of a drift to drift of the
price level sometimes called base drift

37
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,170
overall it seems to me if we were able
to keep the inflation rate at a very low

38
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:28,290
level,
then we would effectively get similar

39
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,450
results to price level targeting.

40
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,020
I think the Fed cut interest rates,
um,

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,590
they're in that period just about a
right.

42
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:47,000
I think it was basically coming down to,
could have been a little faster at that

43
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,340
point.
And of course GDP did a fall

44
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:52,450
tremendously.
But I think if they had kept the

45
00:02:52,451 --> 00:02:53,540
interest rates,
uh,

46
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,460
along the same path,
it would have been fine.

47
00:02:55,461 --> 00:03:00,070
The problems I see at that period was
the tremendous amount of uncertainty

48
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:01,140
added,
uh,

49
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,430
by these,
these new effects.

50
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:06,820
If he liked the quantitative easing.
And sometimes I've called somewhat

51
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,740
pejoratively my industrial policy where
the action's went well beyond the usual

52
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:14,800
interest rates.
And I don't think they were appropriate.

53
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,170
We're still studying them.
Some of them were inappropriate.

54
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:19,930
I just finished a study on mortgage
interest rates.

55
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:22,210
So,
so the question about whether policy

56
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:25,450
could have been even easier going into
the panic.

57
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,960
Uh,
it is certainly something to examine,

58
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:32,890
but I think basically it's about all it
could do at that point.

59
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,320
The,
the problems I saw were not so much in

60
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:39,370
monetary policy at that stage,
but they really,

61
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,570
uh,
ad hoc,

62
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,800
um,
chaotic,

63
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,040
uh,
interventions that occurred around the

64
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,400
time of the roll out of the tarp.
Um,

65
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,290
Eh,
not clear kind of actions with respect

66
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,110
to what happened with Lehman brothers.
So there's a lot of surprises and

67
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:57,580
ultimately a lot of panic.
And I think that panic was induced as

68
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:01,300
I've argued in other places by
government actions.

69
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,070
I think some of the actions of the Fed
after the panic began were constructive

70
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,980
to be sure,
but I don't see that in terms of a

71
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:11,680
faster or reductions in just rates.
In fact,

72
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:14,950
if I could just add,
one thing that I think people should

73
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:19,951
recognize is that while the federal
funds rate target of the FLMC came down

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,560
gradually in the fall of 2008,
the actual rate came down quite a bit

75
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:27,580
more rapidly.
In fact,

76
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:31,660
each of the FMC decisions effectively
ratified the,

77
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,860
what the rate was already at and that
rate came down so rapidly because of the

78
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,240
large expansion in reserve.
So it's hard to see how measured in

79
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:45,241
terms of interest rates policy could
have been much easier in the October,

80
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,773
November,
December period.

81
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,820
Well,
I was under the CBO advisory board for

82
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:55,730
several years,
so I have thought a lot about that

83
00:04:55,731 --> 00:05:00,620
question about how accurate the CBO
projections are over time.

84
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:05,621
I think they do a reasonable job.
They of course focus first on what's

85
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:10,310
happening with the labor force on those,
those groves that are relatively easy to

86
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:14,300
forecast that because you know what the
population is going to be,

87
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,590
the more difficult part of course is
projecting productivity and uh,

88
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:20,780
that's uh,
that's effectively a crap shoot.

89
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,040
It's very hard to project it accurately.
I think they do as good a job as anyone,

90
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:30,041
but you also have to realize that any
longterm projection like that is subject

91
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:34,940
to a tremendous of ans uncertainty.
I think basically the will you have to

92
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:37,070
do is take that uncertainty into
account.

93
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,980
Now,
the CBO course projects much more than

94
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:42,980
10 years.
They're projecting out many decades in

95
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:47,090
order to get estimates of the cost of
the unfunded liabilities.

96
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,790
Those are even more uncertain.
Frequently there,

97
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,700
there are too optimistic I think after
watch for that.

98
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:56,750
But I wouldn't have a general complaint
about longterm CBO.

99
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,860
It seems to me to doing about as best as
you can and they're really not

100
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,960
challenged much in one direction.
Either way,

101
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,350
things California should do to fix it.
Its economy.

102
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,060
I think first you've got to recognize
California has enormous potential.

103
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,670
It has a,
it's a great environment.

104
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,290
Uh,
it's very open to new ideas.

105
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:24,710
Silicon Valley,
it's got great universities,

106
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:25,730
great.
Um,

107
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,940
both the University of California in the
private universities.

108
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,290
So the potential is tremendous.
What we really need to do in California,

109
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,140
here's the deal with the serious,
a budget problem,

110
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:40,430
which means spending grows too much and
then taxes rise and that tends to drive

111
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:44,120
out businesses and ultimately is harmful
to the state.

112
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,660
So I would say number one in terms of
the question is,

113
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:51,661
is put some a limit on the growth of
spending population growth.

114
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,040
Plus inflation is one way to do it,
uh,

115
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,980
that would prevent the ups and downs and
the,

116
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:03,190
and the deficits spending usually rises
rapidly when tax revenues rob and then

117
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,120
tax revenues fall off and you got this
huge deficits.

118
00:07:07,121 --> 00:07:09,350
So control the growth of spending number
one.

119
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,370
Number two,
it put in some tax reforms that prevent

120
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,400
the ups and downs in revenues to be so
great.

121
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,740
And here we've got a huge cyclical,
uh,

122
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,750
performance in tax revenues.
So I would adopt some of the proposals

123
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:27,860
of the recent California Tax Commission
that a governor Schwarzenegger,

124
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,250
I introduced and third edge,
uh,

125
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,740
education K12 it's slipping in
California.

126
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,360
I think it's not a matter of of spending
a lot of spent in California.

127
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,670
It's really demanding more
accountability.

128
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:45,671
I'd like to see a program where there is
more for teachers and less for

129
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:49,580
administration on,
I think that would do a lot of good.

130
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,240
No,
I don't think they should target bubbles

131
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:59,000
like that.
The impacts of monetary policy occur

132
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:04,001
with a long variable lags as Milton
Friedman showed many years ago and seen

133
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:08,810
a lot of evidence.
So timing to deal with bubbles is leaves

134
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:10,970
a lot to be desired,
but more important.

135
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:14,420
I don't think that has been the problem
with respect to monetary policy.

136
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:19,421
Certainly not in this serious crisis.
I think having interest rates too low

137
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:22,430
for too long.
And the 2002,

138
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:24,170
three,
four period,

139
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:29,000
uh,
was really effectively inducing a lot of

140
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:31,430
the,
the bubbles and asset prices,

141
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:35,270
especially housing.
So if interest rates were higher,

142
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,780
closer to what they would have been
under the policy followed,

143
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:43,130
and most of the eighties and nineties,
then I think we wouldn't have had nearly

144
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:47,750
as much of a booming and bus problem.
Not as much of a bubble as we had.

145
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:51,440
So,
so until policy can stop preventing

146
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:53,510
bubbles,
it seems to me that's the number one

147
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:56,910
priority and the,
that people think there's somehow

148
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:00,390
possible to bust them.
It seems to me that is not really

149
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,900
feasible.
And let's get back to the policies of

150
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:06,120
really most of the eighties and nineties
that were,

151
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,210
was working without serious bubbles.
The bubble problem,

152
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:13,320
the housing problem in this crisis
occurred primarily because of a policy

153
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:16,470
getting off track.
Let's get it on track first and then

154
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:17,640
worry about,
uh,

155
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,970
about the bubbles.
I think the bubbles will be much less of

156
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,980
a problem.
They're not going to disappear,

157
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:25,570
of course,
but much less of a problem if Monterey

158
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:28,110
policy followed the kind of actions we
had,

159
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,360
uh,
through much of the eighties and

160
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,193
nineties.

161
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,460
Well,
the question is,

162
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,520
given that the Taylor rule has large
negative interest rates right now,

163
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:42,080
would I want more quantitative easing?
Well,

164
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,430
first of all,
I don't think the Taylor rule does show

165
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:47,670
large negative interest rates right now.
That's kind of a myth.

166
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,820
Taylor rules,
you know,

167
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,880
pretty simple.
It just says the interest rate should

168
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:55,800
equal one and a half times the inflation
rate plus a half times the GDP gap plus

169
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:56,940
one.
Well,

170
00:09:56,941 --> 00:10:01,080
if you plug in reasonable estimates for
what inflation is and what the GDP gap

171
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:02,520
is,
I get a number,

172
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:05,100
it's pretty close to zero,
not minus four,

173
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:07,500
minus five,
not numbers like that.

174
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:10,470
So,
so in fact I would say the amount of

175
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:12,240
quantitative easing,
uh,

176
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,910
it could be reduced.
Um,

177
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,400
right now I hope,
I hope it is reduced in a gradual way.

178
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,740
Some of the mortgage purchases I think
can be slowed down and then actually

179
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,053
reversed.

180
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,110
So a,
it's a,

181
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:30,111
it's a question is a good one and I'm
glad it was asked because there is a lot

182
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,600
I think of misinformation out there
about what the Taylor rule says that

183
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,900
Taylor was a very simple,
as I just mentioned,

184
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:38,320
you can say it,
uh,

185
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,350
in,
in a sentence and you plug in the

186
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:43,640
numbers,
you don't get minus five minus 6%,

187
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,700
you get something much closer to,
to zero where the interest rate is now.

188
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,750
Now that of course has implications
going down the road because it says to

189
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:56,070
the extent that real gd pick picks up,
I hope it does,

190
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,260
uh,
or if inflation picks up,

191
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:01,050
hope it doesn't.
But if either of those occur,

192
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:05,730
then you'd have to see interest rates
starting to move above this zero to 25

193
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,430
basis point range.
And if we don't,

194
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,460
then we're going to be back into the
same kind of situation we were in 2002

195
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:17,730
through four and that of course could
begin to induce bubbles.

196
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:19,350
And we certainly don't want that to
happen.

197
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,240
No,
I don't think quantitative easing at

198
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:28,350
this point,
uh,

199
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:30,120
would,
uh,

200
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,390
uh,
effectively smooth the recovery.

201
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:36,230
I think right now,
based on historical experience,

202
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:41,070
the interest rate is about where it is.
It's not that we don't need a lot of

203
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:43,140
quantitative easing.
We've had some,

204
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:46,080
I think the job of the Fed now is to
bring it back.

205
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,240
They're talking about doing that,
which is good.

206
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,560
So I think for me the most important
thing now for policy to have a good

207
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:58,060
recovery is to reduce this tremendous
amount of uncertainty that exists with

208
00:11:58,061 --> 00:12:01,630
re boat for both monetary policy and
fiscal policy.

209
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,490
And the uncertainty for monetary policy
is we don't know how rapidly the

210
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:10,960
quantitative easing will be reversed.
We don't know what's going to happen

211
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:13,960
with interest rates or is a lot of
questions there.

212
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:18,820
So I'd say get back to the things that
were working during the great moderation

213
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,980
period,
the eighties and nineties primarily.

214
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:26,020
And that means letting interest rates
rise appropriately and reducing the

215
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:29,710
amount of quantitative easing.
Getting back to where it was a through

216
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:31,630
most of the policy in the eighties and
nineties.

217
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,090
I think the most important unresolved
question and monetary economics is the

218
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:44,590
interaction between the financial sector
and uh,

219
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,670
monetary policy,
uh,

220
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,000
has been lots of thinking about it over
the years.

221
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,850
Some of it actually done here at
Stanford,

222
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:55,930
girly and Shaw,
a lot of it done by tobin at Yale.

223
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:56,800
Uh,
uh,

224
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,730
Ben Bernanki has done some good,
but I think the most promising part is

225
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:05,590
the combination of the newest work on a
pricing of,

226
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,600
of uh,
bonds and securities.

227
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,890
A lot of it's done by Monica PSAC and
some of her colleagues to combine that

228
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,090
with,
uh,

229
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,620
with monetary policy so that you have a
sense of what's going to happen to

230
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:20,770
longer term rates when the short rate is
reduced.

231
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:24,100
What's going to happen to credit flows
and how much are credited flow is going

232
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:27,040
to impact the economy.
Uh,

233
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:32,041
this crisis has been very clear in
demonstrating that more work on the

234
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:36,090
connection between,
I feel like financial economics and,

235
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,770
and monetary policy is needed.

236
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,110
In fact,
there's still a lot of questions out

237
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:45,970
there and policy about whether the
financial markets performed well or not.

238
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,500
It seems to me,
uh,

239
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:48,610
if you look at them,
they,

240
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:53,670
they absorbed a tremendous shock of,
from policies as effectively of a panic,

241
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,230
uh,
induced by some,

242
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:00,980
some ad hoc policy changes and they
responded quickly,

243
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:03,700
uh,
and they responded in a way which has

244
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:07,090
been smooth as the markets themselves,
the institutions,

245
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:09,780
the financial institutions of course,
uh,

246
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,840
have been great difficulty.
But the markets themselves have worked

247
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:14,620
well.
So,

248
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,690
so to me though,
the where are we should focus our

249
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:19,630
attention really is this,
is this connection between the,

250
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:22,480
the financial markets including the
financial institutions,

251
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,390
uh,
and the monetary policy itself.

252
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,590
I think we need to have both
independence and accountability.

253
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,870
They go together.
That's not one or the other.

254
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,400
So in answer to the question,
how important is fed independence?

255
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:42,790
I say it's very important,
but a needs to be matched with

256
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:46,690
accountability.
A lot of the concerns that you're seeing

257
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,660
in the congress,
in the country about the Fed,

258
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:54,180
the Ron Paul Bill,
I think that's a reaction to what it

259
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,630
looks like.
A very uh,

260
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,910
interventionists actions by the Federal
Reserve.

261
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,770
Not a lot of descriptions of how it
actually occurred is no,

262
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,480
no reports on what's called the section
13 three intervention,

263
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:10,670
section 13 three,
the Federal Reserve Act,

264
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,810
uh,
which,

265
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,040
which allows for such actions,
but there's very little reporting on how

266
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,770
it actually took place.
So I think the best thing the Fed can do

267
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:21,650
to get back some of its independence,
and quite frankly,

268
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,200
I think it's lost a little bit in this
crisis.

269
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,380
Best thing it can do is to be very
accountable about some of the

270
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:30,980
intervention ventures in section 13
three.

271
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,490
That's where most of the transparency
concerns exist at this point.

272
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,650
And then of course to emphasize that
the,

273
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,230
the policy that has worked most well was
the policy of,

274
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,470
of the eighties and nineties.
And when we got off track of the on

275
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:46,610
that,
uh,

276
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:51,611
things deteriorated I think did some
recognition of interest rates being so

277
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:56,540
low for so long and o two o four period,
uh,

278
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,260
by the leadership,
uh,

279
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,100
would be very important.
It's discussed in the Fed system is

280
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:04,910
disgusted by their central banks.
It's discussed quite widely,

281
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:08,930
but so some recognition of that seems to
me it would be important in terms of

282
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:11,260
bringing back some of the independence,
the,

283
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,060
the Fed lost.
So I think in independence,

284
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,390
just to summarize Israeli really
important,

285
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:20,930
it's a essentially we've seen evidence
over time about how it is,

286
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:25,820
but it has to be matched with a strong
sense of accountability to the Congress,

287
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,120
to the American people for what the Fed
is actually doing.

288
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,440
And See,
I think it's not the thing the Federal

289
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,920
Reserve should be doing.
I think the Fed should be focusing on

290
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,270
the overall level of interest rates,
not trying to intervene in certain

291
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:48,680
sectors.
I a year ago I wrote a paper and

292
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:53,681
presented at the annual meetings of the
economists arguing that this was what I

293
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:59,060
called [inaudible] industrial policy.
It's using monetary policy to intervene

294
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,750
in certain sectors.
Certain firms is of course part of that

295
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:05,030
as well.
So I think it'd be better if monetary

296
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:09,830
policy did not do that.
I've just completed a study trying to

297
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:14,720
look at the impacts of the purchases of
the mortgage back securities by the Fed

298
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:16,940
and I,
I actually don't think there is large

299
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,720
had as large an impact on rates to as
many people believe.

300
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:24,710
We'll be studying that for a while,
but more important the impact is quite

301
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:28,520
unreliable.
It's a very hard to measure a lot of

302
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:29,150
uncertainty.

303
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,910
So the notion that the Fed could go in
the business of,

304
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:37,330
of controlling the mortgage rates as it
has affected the funds rate for years I

305
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:41,000
think is really a mistaken wishful
thinking.

306
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,550
It would take the Fed in the wrong
direction.

307
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,580
So this is the more we can get back to a
monetary policy which is focusing on the

308
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:54,291
overall level of the money supply of the
overall level of interest rates rather

309
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,490
than intervene in certain sectors the
better.

310
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:59,580
That's not monetary policy.
That's the kind of things that raise

311
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:03,000
peoples doubts about monetary policy.
They question,

312
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:07,470
why should an independent agency of
government be intervening in certain

313
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:09,270
sectors like that?
Uh,

314
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:12,360
the,
the Treasury has bought a mortgage,

315
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,290
mortgage back securities that doesn't
raise the same independence questions,

316
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,480
uh,
that the Fed has raised by these

317
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:19,650
purchases.
So it's,

318
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,940
it's one of the biggest issues now,
uh,

319
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,550
to address,
if you read,

320
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,910
for example,
Brian's sacs recent speech,

321
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:30,150
he's a at the New York Fed,
he acts as if this is like a new

322
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,150
instrument for monetary policy in the
future.

323
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,130
Uh,
one of his predecessors,

324
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,380
Peter Fisher,
who's now at Black Rock,

325
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,190
uh,
cause this price keeping operations.

326
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,300
And I think there's a huge amount of
doubts about this a,

327
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:47,820
its effectiveness,
its reliability,

328
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,370
and it has,
uh,

329
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,780
raises questions about the Fed's
independence.

330
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:56,070
So I feel strongly that this is not the
kind of thing that we should have the

331
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:57,240
Fed doing in the future.

332
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,710
No,
I don't think there's any reason to do

333
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:07,740
that.
I always assumed the inflation target

334
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:11,430
should be 2%.
If some people think it should be lower,

335
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:16,790
let's maybe talk about changing it,
but varying across the business cycle

336
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:20,160
seems to me to be just an extra element
of confusion.

337
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,450
Uh,
two people,

338
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:25,410
there's no reason to do that.
So the question is for me,

339
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:26,910
his mood,
how would you adjust it?

340
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,000
I think rather than move it around in
the business cycle,

341
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:34,140
is to do as good a job as possible as
assessing what,

342
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,070
how you measure the inflation target.
There was a been a lot of confusion,

343
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:42,180
for example,
about using the core inflation rate.

344
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,750
I've always preferred to use a smoothing
device.

345
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:49,590
That is the average inflation rate over
a few quarters is actually a four

346
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:53,940
quarters in the Taylor rule.
But the core rates,

347
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,970
uh,
especially if they're consistently

348
00:19:56,971 --> 00:20:01,971
higher than the headline rates over
several years,

349
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:06,330
then uh,
or lower would be the other way around.

350
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:10,590
Then they can be misleading.
So for one year or so,

351
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,380
paying attention to the core and looking
at that's important,

352
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:15,960
but,
but ultimately it's the,

353
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,920
it's the measured inflation rate,
the headline inflation rate that's most

354
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:22,410
important.
And that's what I would focus on.

355
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:24,630
And again,
no reason to be changing that that would

356
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:29,580
just add confusion and uncertainty to
what monetary policy is doing.

357
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,080
I think of these as the original cause
of he like really what got the excess is

358
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:42,670
going.
It was a big deviation,

359
00:20:42,671 --> 00:20:44,460
300 basis points.
Um,

360
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,000
we hadn't seen deviations like that
since 19 seven days,

361
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:51,460
which of course was another period of
uh,

362
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,230
lots of recession's a very severe one
and I'm 81,

363
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:57,940
82.
Uh,

364
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:02,860
so I think that there is a,
a lot of evidence that says this was a

365
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:08,080
really the factor that got things going
in terms of the excess is the boom and

366
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:09,880
ultimately the bus and housing,
the,

367
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,150
the search for a yield,
the extra risk taking.

368
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,830
Uh,
and I think you could have a guests that

369
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:22,831
something would happen based on a
previous periods where central banks

370
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:27,991
have deviated from the Taylor rule or
other similar guidelines.

371
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,400
It's,
it's amazing to me through history and

372
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:34,840
through time how much evidence there is
that when central banks deviate from

373
00:21:34,841 --> 00:21:38,110
that kind of policy that things don't
work out well.

374
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,260
And we saw that and the United States in
the seven days,

375
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,770
terrible time with high inflation and
recessions.

376
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,440
We've seen it in other countries.
And as countries started to follow those

377
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:49,570
principles,
things got better.

378
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:52,570
And so in some sense,
we now unfortunately have another piece

379
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:56,120
of evidence that when policy deviated,
uh,

380
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,010
we had a big recession.
I actually say the great moderation was

381
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:04,360
ended by the great deviation,
which has led to this great recession.

382
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:09,070
Now I want to be very clear that other
things happened that made this situation

383
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:11,230
worse.
I made that clear.

384
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:11,970
And,
and,

385
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,880
uh,
my book,

386
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:14,410
for example,
getting off track,

387
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:19,060
that there was really three things,
the deviation from a monetary policy

388
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:22,150
rules.
The second was misdiagnosing the crisis

389
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,980
in the summer of 2007 as a liquidity
problem rather than a problem in the

390
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:29,250
banks.
And the third was this,

391
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:33,460
this panic in the fall of 2008,
September,

392
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:36,670
October,
which I think was largely a result of

393
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:37,980
the rather chaotic,
uh,

394
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,060
government,
uh,

395
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,200
responses to the crisis.
So,

396
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,630
so the deviation was part of it,
but they're,

397
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:46,480
in some sense,
there are other deviations from

398
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:49,360
policies.
A deviations in the directions of a very

399
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,320
interventionist policies,
misdiagnoses,

400
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,260
which is really why this one has been so
severe.

401
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,453
Unfortunately.

402
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,820
Uh,
Charles Good.

403
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,830
Our has it makes a good point with that,
that the policy responses actually

404
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:14,350
affect individual behavior.
I think it's a what makes policy

405
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,530
difficult.
I think you can take account of those

406
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:21,670
and be wary of them and still have
conducted policy.

407
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,040
So I'll give an example.
I think,

408
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,530
uh,
when,

409
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,860
when bond traders,
people in the markets have a sense of

410
00:23:29,861 --> 00:23:34,510
what monetary policy is going to be
liked and they will price securities,

411
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:36,150
longer insecurities,
medium rums,

412
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,720
securities,
uh,

413
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:39,220
based on that,
uh,

414
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,760
if the policy moves to something else,
say for example,

415
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:45,130
a deviates from what hadn't been
working,

416
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,780
they,
it takes them a while to figure out

417
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:49,760
what's going to happen.
But they will adjust the,

418
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,950
adjust their forecast,
their procedures,

419
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,340
their rules of thumb,
sometimes indirectly,

420
00:23:55,341 --> 00:23:57,800
sometimes somewhat in inadvertently
they'll do it.

421
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,600
Uh,
so that's the adjustment.

422
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:03,890
But that's why we like our policies to
be as predictable as possible.

423
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,930
Uh,
so that people can make these

424
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:08,390
adjustments.
So I would say this is,

425
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:13,391
to me goodhart's law is another reason
not to be a changing from a policy

426
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:17,570
that's worked well.
I'd say not to do too much fine tuning

427
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:18,404
in a way.
What,

428
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,010
what Goodhart's law shows you is that
efforts to,

429
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,250
to find tune can actually um,
be uh,

430
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,700
something that's it's harmful.
In fact,

431
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:33,410
I think the period in the early say 2002
for a period,

432
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,110
uh,
that could very well be explained by an

433
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:39,920
effort to make policy even better than
it was during the great moderation.

434
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:43,340
If you like trying to find tune in an
extra way,

435
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,190
bring rates below what had worked
before,

436
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,790
those are all fine tuning things.
And,

437
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,720
and I think what messages such as
Goodhart's law show you is that the

438
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:58,280
reaction to those can sometimes be hard
to predict.

439
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:00,350
People will begin to see that there's
an,

440
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,300
there's another target does another
idea.

441
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:05,450
You're moving away from the equilibrium
and,

442
00:25:05,451 --> 00:25:08,300
and that's a reason I think to keep it
simple if you like,

443
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:11,720
keep the policy as simple as possible.
Keep the regulations as simple as

444
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:14,510
possible.
And that's true of both monetary policy.

445
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:15,530
And fiscal policy.

446
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,620
Oh,
there's several ways policy could have

447
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:27,210
been more predictable in this crisis.
I think first of all,

448
00:25:27,211 --> 00:25:31,770
by sticking to the predictable policy
that worked well in the eighties and

449
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,750
nineties with respect to the setting of
interest rates,

450
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,270
that's something that I think we have a
lot of,

451
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,270
a lot of evidence for.
The was unpredictable,

452
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,900
a surprise if he liked to take rates too
low for so long,

453
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:44,790
even though there was an effort to
explain it.

454
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,260
Uh,
it was,

455
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,440
it was hard for people to understand how
long that was going to be.

456
00:25:49,441 --> 00:25:52,830
Was it a new policy of actual low
interest rates or not?

457
00:25:52,831 --> 00:25:56,850
So that's an element of unpredictability
that I think has caused damage.

458
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,920
I think a second thing I would stress is
the response to the problems in the

459
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:03,960
financial institutions.
You know,

460
00:26:03,961 --> 00:26:08,550
first of all,
misdiagnosing it as a a liquidity

461
00:26:08,551 --> 00:26:11,820
problem.
So more liquidity was pumped into the

462
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:15,030
economy,
new facilities were set up that added

463
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:18,510
unpredictability rather than looking at
the,

464
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,290
at the evidence that there was a problem
in the banks due to the mortgages and

465
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,510
the,
the other toxic assets.

466
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,390
And then I'd say the third element of
unpredictability,

467
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:30,570
it's probably the most important for the
severe panic.

468
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,180
And I would go back to,
for example,

469
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:38,100
the bear stearns intervention.
Let's just take as a given,

470
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,480
although it's debatable that that,
uh,

471
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,040
was the right thing to do and the heat
of the moment very difficult under

472
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:47,100
pressure.
I've been in policy making jobs.

473
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:49,560
They know what that's like.
So the decision was to,

474
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,670
uh,
intervene and bail out of bear stearns

475
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,100
creditors.
It seems to me at that that was the

476
00:26:56,101 --> 00:27:01,101
moment to be as clear as possible about
what would be the policy in case another

477
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:07,480
institution had some problems to
articulate it,

478
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,860
but it was very little description of
it.

479
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,730
In fact,
policies tended to vary from case to

480
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:17,880
case.
You had the Indian Mac at Wamu,

481
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:19,350
you had,
of course,

482
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:21,300
the Lehman brothers,
aig,

483
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,340
Fannie and Freddie.
In each case,

484
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,050
there was a difference in each one.

485
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,560
Seemed to be approached independently,
if you like,

486
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:32,910
ad hoc without an overall strategy,
that's probably the biggest degree of an

487
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,120
unpredictability.
Equity Holders,

488
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,790
um,
preferred equity holders,

489
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,980
uh,
debt holders,

490
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,250
bank holding company versus bank.
Uh,

491
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,800
various kinds of senior creditors,
counterparties,

492
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,760
huge amount of uncertainty about how
they were going to be treated.

493
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:52,211
And,
and,

494
00:27:52,211 --> 00:27:54,210
and of course,
when all the ultimate,

495
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,880
uh,
policy was put forth,

496
00:27:56,881 --> 00:27:59,610
the so called a tarp,
uh,

497
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,950
was put forth in a way which was quite
confusing.

498
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:05,710
The treasury secretary just had a two
and a half pages,

499
00:28:05,711 --> 00:28:07,860
uh,
testified with the chairman of the Fed

500
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:10,170
and the Banking Committee and,
uh,

501
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,980
couldn't answer in my view,
the questions very well.

502
00:28:13,981 --> 00:28:15,960
Huge,
irate response from,

503
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,850
from the congress at that point.
And it really then became very clear,

504
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:23,940
I think,
that there wasn't really a policy.

505
00:28:23,941 --> 00:28:27,810
They had not been thinking about it,
at least as evidenced from the testimony

506
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,860
and the other actions.
And so that was probably the most

507
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:34,950
unpredictable,
most damaging part of this whole

508
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:35,784
episode.

509
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,640
This is a question about the timing of
the panic and whether it was associated

510
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:51,831
with the Lehman brothers bankruptcy or
with the responses of the government

511
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:59,100
more generally.
And basically as soon as that occurred,

512
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:04,190
I looked at the data and I saw much more
evidence that the panic and the markets

513
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:08,340
were associated with the government's
responses or a week or 10 days later.

514
00:29:08,341 --> 00:29:13,341
That's the time that say the s and p 500
fell by a nearly 30%,

515
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,700
very a 10 times greater than what
happened.

516
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,440
Um,
at the time of Lehman.

517
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:22,620
Yes.
And p 500 was higher the Friday after

518
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:26,070
the Lehman bankruptcy than the Friday
before.

519
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,241
So the,
the,

520
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:30,960
and there's lots of other data to look
at that shows you that there's as much

521
00:29:30,961 --> 00:29:32,260
more investigation.
Uh,

522
00:29:32,261 --> 00:29:34,290
there's a,
for example,

523
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,080
not one counterparty,
uh,

524
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:42,110
driven of counterparty to Lehman filed
for bankruptcy after the Lehman case.

525
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,713
There was,
um,

526
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:49,230
the major creditors we did not fail.
So it's hard to find a direct knock on

527
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:53,200
effects from that in the data.
So the more I look at it,

528
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:55,750
the more it seems to me there.
The other explanation,

529
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,370
uh,
makes sense.

530
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:02,620
Now I'd say now you need to think about
what the counterfactual would have been.

531
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:05,350
And I guess I'd go back to something
I've stressed before,

532
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:10,351
that if there had been a clear policy
put forth whereby people could have

533
00:30:11,891 --> 00:30:16,891
expected the possibility at least of a,
a leman being put through bankruptcy,

534
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:20,050
then there could have been some
preparation.

535
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,610
Uh,
there wasn't any,

536
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,350
the day of the announcement,
um,

537
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,600
in September of 2008,
uh,

538
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,000
people were just beginning to think
about how it work.

539
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:32,500
It was really,
I think,

540
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:36,400
a surprise that had been no preparation.
And so it was a jolt.

541
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,900
Let's be sure it was a jolt.

542
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,970
But,
but it seems to me that the direct

543
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,840
connections that people talk about with
the expected cascading and domino

544
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:45,260
effects,
uh,

545
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:48,010
we're not there and it really occurs
later.

546
00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:49,690
There's,
there's more evidence for this.

547
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:50,860
Um,
uh,

548
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:55,030
John Cochran,
Luigi Zingales in Chicago have have put

549
00:30:55,031 --> 00:30:58,360
more out,
I think the former FDAC chair,

550
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,570
uh,
Bill Isaac has studied it and comes to

551
00:31:01,571 --> 00:31:03,550
the same kind of conclusion.
So while,

552
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:08,970
well it was originally controversial
when I put this idea of forth over a

553
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,380
year ago actually in a,
in a speech at the,

554
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:14,260
uh,
Bank of Canada in November of 2008.

555
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,450
Uh,
it was viewed as controversial,

556
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,080
but I just looking at the data then,
but more and more you look at what

557
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:23,110
happened internally,
talk to people and study,

558
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,080
uh,
the aftermath it seems to me there is at

559
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:28,330
least as much,
let me just put it evenly at least as

560
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:33,331
much evidence that uh,
the panic was caused by the response as

561
00:31:33,431 --> 00:31:37,180
distinct from that particular event at
Lehman Brothers.

562
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,060
And I think it's more evidence.
I think it's actually becoming

563
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:43,240
overwhelming and looking at the data
carefully at um,

564
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,720
spreads in the markets at what's
happening to the equity markets and also

565
00:31:49,061 --> 00:31:51,940
looking at what's happened in the
aftermath of the bankruptcy of Lehman

566
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:53,050
brothers.
Those are the kinds of,

567
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:58,051
he like nitty gritty details that we
need to be studying to understand what

568
00:31:58,061 --> 00:32:01,210
happened.
We're doing that work here at Stanford,

569
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,910
at the Hoover Institution,
a lot of focus on,

570
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:06,800
and we have a whole working group.
It's delving until we're talking.

571
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,130
We've talked to people,
former policy makers,

572
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,720
and also people in the private sector to
try to understand this and match it up

573
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:16,270
with the data.
And I think that's the most important

574
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:19,210
thing to do.
Now come to some conclusion about what

575
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:24,211
actually happened so that we can then
take the appropriate remedies reforms to

576
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:25,900
make sure it doesn't happen again.

577
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,580
Why have I disapproved of the stimulus
of the,

578
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,920
the like large countercyclical a
Keynesian policies?

579
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,130
Because I don't think we have ever had
much evidence that they work.

580
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:48,131
And so let me draw it to be specific.
The first stimulus was in early 2008 and

581
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:54,581
that was largely in the form of one time
rebate check sent to individuals.

582
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:59,020
A lot of money went out and,
uh,

583
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,860
eat basic economic theory would tell you
that that would not jumpstart

584
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,120
consumption.
People would save most of that.

585
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,830
So unlike what was advertised,
a,

586
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,370
it shouldn't stimulate the economy.
And in fact,

587
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:15,110
if you go back and look at it carefully,
look at the numbers as I've done,

588
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:19,100
you don't see an impact.
You see that big rebate just Wen to

589
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:22,220
people's pockets and didn't,
didn't dot John Stark consumption.

590
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:24,710
In fact,
consumption's going the other way at

591
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:28,430
that point.
And then you had the stimulus of a 2009

592
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,120
to the extent that that was based on
sending checks to people,

593
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:36,020
you see exactly the same thing happening
one time payments,

594
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,070
uh,
temporary,

595
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,700
uh,
tax cuts don't stimulate,

596
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,560
uh,
spending or consumption.

597
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,930
And again,
we knew that for years and years and

598
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:47,360
years,
that's why policy and most of the

599
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,850
eighties and nineties didn't take those
kinds of approaches.

600
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:53,270
And so,
so then that brings you to the question

601
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:56,720
about government purchases.
Can that be more effective?

602
00:33:56,721 --> 00:33:57,171
Well,
yes,

603
00:33:57,171 --> 00:34:00,350
in principle it can be if it's timed
right,

604
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:02,930
if it's a,
if it's done in time,

605
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:07,880
but this stimulus package of 2008,
the government purchases part of it is

606
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:12,080
spread out over a long period of time.
Most of them haven't even come in line

607
00:34:12,081 --> 00:34:14,000
yet.
The government purchases side.

608
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:18,290
And so I don't see that that's a
stimulating the economy.

609
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:23,030
The rebound in the economy has been to
do to things like inventory changes,

610
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,930
recognition that the panic is over,
uh,

611
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,610
and investment side.
And so,

612
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,850
so you can find the impacts of it.
And it's,

613
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:36,851
it's unfortunate because that means that
we've got a huge increase in our debt,

614
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,600
uh,
and,

615
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:40,670
uh,
that's ultimately harmful.

616
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,280
We didn't get much out of it in terms of
stimulus.

617
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,780
So I'm,
I'm convinced,

618
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,880
you know,
what I like to do is not just look at

619
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:49,040
the models.
Uh,

620
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:53,630
I've looked at a new keynesian model,
looked at a model I built many years

621
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,190
ago,
looked at other people's models,

622
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:00,550
and they're good for assessing impacts.
But ultimately what we need to do now

623
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:03,320
that we've had these packages is to look
at what happened.

624
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,960
You go away from the models,
look at what happened.

625
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,960
Did Jumpstart,
did consumption get jumpstarted?

626
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,750
I say no.
Was the recovery due to the stimulus?

627
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:14,540
It seems not because it was in the form
of investment.

628
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,860
Uh,
so,

629
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:20,030
so I think ultimately we can learn from
this experience.

630
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:25,090
I don't know exactly why we moved away
from the policies that we're working,

631
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:29,330
which is really an aversion to these
large countercyclical policies.

632
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:34,750
It began in the early 2008 and I just
continued and it may continue further.

633
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:36,950
And I think let's start learning from
what,

634
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,060
and not be ideological about this,
not consider what school is one in,

635
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:44,670
but looked at the facts.
And when I look at the facts,

636
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:46,500
I don't see much impact of these
policies.

637
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,990
I would say the responsibility of Wall
Street in this crisis and it still

638
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:59,010
hasn't been resolved,
is the dependence on the financial

639
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:01,110
institutions,
uh,

640
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:05,430
on the government for a bailout and
interventions.

641
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,900
In other words,
the institutions had become large enough

642
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:10,950
that,
um,

643
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:15,900
and complicated enough that at least
that led people to say we needed to have

644
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:16,734
these,
um,

645
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,570
these bailouts,
these interventions.

646
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,550
Each time it was,
uh,

647
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,040
eh,
people said to be systemic risk.

648
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,600
It was like,
you know,

649
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:28,380
calling saying there's a fire in a
theater crying fire in a theater.

650
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:32,360
And it led to these responses,
which I say we're quite chaotic and,

651
00:36:32,361 --> 00:36:33,960
and not,
not systematic.

652
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:37,110
They really led to problems.
So I think what has to happen in the

653
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:40,770
future as Wall Street,
the large firms have to find a way to

654
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:41,700
say,
you know,

655
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:44,420
we are not going to depend on the
government for bail out,

656
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:47,940
just like a startup firm out here in
Silicon Valley.

657
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,190
If it fails,
it's not going to be bailed out by the

658
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:52,650
government.
Same should be true for the large

659
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:54,960
financial institutions.
They should find a way to do that.

660
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:58,320
It seems to me some sense they're
responsible for doing that.

661
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,790
They want to be responsible citizens.
But I think in the meantime,

662
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:07,170
government needs to find a way for it to
get out of this a bailout business.

663
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,390
There's an example.
I would,

664
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,080
I would,
uh,

665
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,820
point to where this,
uh,

666
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,840
there has been a change in the 1990s.
The IMF,

667
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,690
uh,
did a lot of bailouts.

668
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,830
Uh,
United States participated in some of

669
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:23,220
those and pays a Mexico,
but it got quite chaotic.

670
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:25,920
And the case of US Southeast Asia
crisis,

671
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:27,850
they were sometimes and sometimes not
in,

672
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,480
in the case of Russia,
they were in for a while and they pulled

673
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,950
out.
And of course we had a lot of contagent

674
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:37,400
and a globally,
but it wasn't until maybe 2002,

675
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,120
three,
that a,

676
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:42,630
the policy became more predictable and
more understandable.

677
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,340
The IMF,
uh,

678
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,530
let out some procedures that are called
it,

679
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:50,790
the exceptional access framework and
clarified what their operations would

680
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:53,010
be.
And so the expectation of a,

681
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,310
of a bailout out of a country,
in this case,

682
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,860
sovereign debt was reduced
substantially.

683
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,400
And I think you saw a huge improvement
in the emerging markets.

684
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:06,150
Some of them made an extra effort to
build up their reserve.

685
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:07,980
Some of them they do.
So their deficits,

686
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:11,460
they made the adjustments and,
and they'd been stronger as a result.

687
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,710
Uh,
and that shows you what can happen if

688
00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:17,760
the policy of a,
it becomes more predictable and less,

689
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,750
uh,
expected bailouts or in the system.
