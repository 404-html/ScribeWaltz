1
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,030
I think it's important to have something
that's beneath the surface.

2
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:12,850
Otherwise you're writing essentially

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,450
an elaborate diary entry.
Um,

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,050
I think profundity is in the eye of the
beholder.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,050
Um,
some of my,

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,140
some of the essays I get that were
eliminated from the collection,

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,600
there were a couple of them that I
decided not to include because they

8
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:31,860
didn't have enough and,
or any universal application,

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,210
you know,
what was me,

10
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:37,080
I got a parking ticket or you know,
some boy was mean to me and no one,

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,200
particularly carers,
but uh,

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,590
you can make people care about small,
significant details and sort of lend the

13
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:47,820
entire universe to a tiny detail.
You know,

14
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:52,260
there's this sort of like themed and
Buddhist Meditation Practice where

15
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,660
you're supposed to picture the entire
world on the head of a pin,

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,540
you know,
and I feel like the only kind of

17
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:02,010
meditation or stillness or non neuroses
it's ever made any sense to me.

18
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,850
Um,
and that's sort of what the essays try

19
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:07,050
to do.
Um,

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,910
you know,
some of the critiques have been at,

21
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:11,940
some of them don't do that,
that some of them read a little bit too

22
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:14,130
casual.
I think when you're writing personal

23
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:14,761
essays,
it's,

24
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:16,890
it can be difficult to suss out,
uh,

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,820
what seems profound to you because they,
it's not necessarily intellectually

26
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:25,680
profound,
sort of emotionally profound.

27
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,870
So if you're just sort of coming through
it,

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,370
you know,
it's what speaks to or,

29
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,160
or what,

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,160
what does,
it's funny,

31
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:37,960
I've spent I guess about seven years

32
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:43,020
in total encouraging my author is not to
pay too much attention to the critics.

33
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:46,570
That all press is good press.
You know,

34
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,990
book publicity is very different than
any other kind of publicity.

35
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:52,620
And the fact that I have friends who
work in music and film publicity and

36
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:56,050
it's much more defensive whereas ours is
much more,

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,600
you know,
please God Mr. Short story writer,

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,030
go commit a felony so I can get you some
press.

39
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:02,470
It's very difficult.
And,

40
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:04,600
uh,
so just to be written about,

41
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,430
uh,
and then is,

42
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:08,710
it is a feat in itself.
And then I guess you kind of worry about

43
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,870
the tone second.
Um,

44
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,500
and I think I have luckily taken a
little bit of that to heart.

45
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,210
Um,
the criticism hasn't been too harsh or I

46
00:02:19,211 --> 00:02:21,370
don't see it because they're personal
essays.

47
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:26,371
I think if I let it all in thoroughly,
it would be a critique of me as a human

48
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:26,740
being.

49
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,140
So it's very easy to look at it and
think,

50
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,990
you know,
a lot of the book reviews have been

51
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:35,860
assigned to people who are slightly
younger or my age.

52
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,220
And you know,
I,

53
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:43,221
I have been sort of more interested to
see the reviews by reviewers who I know

54
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:47,950
have been doing it for a while and are
really reviewing it as a book as opposed

55
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:52,951
to a extended diary entry that they
could have written if only they had had

56
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,070
a couple of more red balls after work,
you know,

57
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,090
so it's,
it's pretty easy to slough off,

58
00:02:58,091 --> 00:02:59,680
but I think it's important to some of
it.

59
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:02,860
And um,
and some of it's been really helpful.

60
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:06,010
I didn't expect that.
I expected just to be worried about

61
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,800
getting press and,
and hopefully getting the book out there

62
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,300
and getting people aware of it.
And,

63
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,380
and some of the critiques have been
actually really useful.

64
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,510
Also.
That was a pleasant surprise.
