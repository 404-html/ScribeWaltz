1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,990
Well,
my suspicion is that people are not

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,970
really,
at least in all cases,

3
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:17,120
more motivated by economic concerns than
other concerns.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,480
What I suspect is that people think they
have to talk in economic terms.

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,200
They have to provide economic
justifications for things that they

6
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:30,350
actually want to do for other sorts of
considerations.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,840
And I'll just give you a few examples of
that.

8
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:37,730
They're really a grab bag of examples of
people.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,240
People did not go into the streets
ultimately to overthrow communism in

10
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:48,680
1989 in eastern Europe because they did
some kind of benefit cost analysis and

11
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:53,540
decided that the risk of being run over
by a Soviet tank with somehow less than

12
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:57,710
the benefit they might gain if there was
a transition to a capitalist economy.

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,500
I mean,
they did this out of a,

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,720
out of a sense of idealism,
out of a sense of the dignity of a,

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,230
of individual people that was being
trampled in these kinds of societies and

16
00:01:09,231 --> 00:01:11,570
out of a vision of what a better world
could be.

17
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,320
They didn't do it in economic terms.
Um,

18
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,620
similarly today,
in the last decade in American society,

19
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:22,010
there are people who favor a policy that
I very much disagree with,

20
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,130
that's known as the war on drugs.
The war on drugs is not an economically

21
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:31,640
rational policy,
and even people who support the war on

22
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:33,980
drugs would not argue for it and
economic grounds.

23
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:37,550
They argue for it on moral grounds that
it's wrong for people to take drugs.

24
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,320
It's wrong for society to send a message
that says that it's okay to do that.

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,040
So I think generally we do still often
act out of non economic motives.

26
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,610
It's just that like those people in the
16th century,

27
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,930
somehow we think we need to defend those
actions.

28
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,020
Now on the basis of economics.
Then on the basis of religion,

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,090
I think one of the hopeful signs is that
President Obama is beginning to bring

30
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:09,290
back a richer and fuller.
And ultimately what I think is a more

31
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:13,700
realistic and more human kind of
rhetoric to our political debates.

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,120
There are many issues in American public
life that,

33
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,470
that divide people and interesting and
somewhat unpredictable way.

34
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:26,200
So there are people,
often people associated with the

35
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:30,130
political right who say that we should,
you should only do things that make

36
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:33,550
sense economically and what is all this
nonsense that environmentalist want to

37
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:35,800
do to lock up wilderness areas and so
on.

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,400
But then when it comes to issues like a
outlying drugs outlawing abortion range

39
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:45,220
of other issues,
they're the ones who are taking moral

40
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:48,610
positions.
They're not taking hardheaded sort of

41
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,260
libertarian a positions based on
economic realities.

42
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,360
None of us are rational economic man as
we're supposed to be portrayed in

43
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:01,090
economic,
were mixes of passions,

44
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:03,210
of,
of desires,

45
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:05,470
of a moral principles,
of,

46
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,150
of self,
deception,

47
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,030
of altruism,
of concern for others,

48
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,850
concerned for ourselves and an interest
in our bank.

49
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:17,500
Accounts and social policies have to be
responsive to the complexity of who we

50
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:20,200
are as people or else like the war on
drugs.

51
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,580
They're simply going to fail.

52
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,240
I think one reason we fetishize
economics is because we have come to

53
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:34,701
think that it is essentially connected
to wellbeing about what it is to have a

54
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:38,280
good life.
And in fact,

55
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:42,090
there's very little psychological
evidence for this being a very strong

56
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,540
relationship.
Um,

57
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,720
if you look at the work psychologists
have done with the individual reports of

58
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:51,720
wellbeing,
what happens is that if you're poor,

59
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,410
you are not happy,
but once you achieve a certain level of

60
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:57,700
material satisfaction,
um,

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,050
then income has very little correlation
with people's report.

62
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:05,130
It states of happiness,
things like climate matter,

63
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:09,690
more things like the,
the culture of the country in which

64
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,450
you're raised matter more.
And so two things really,

65
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,970
let's face it,
like individual temperament matter,

66
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,300
matter more than these things.
So once we see that economics is to a

67
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:24,240
very great extent,
detached from what it is that really

68
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:28,530
give us quality of life,
that can be a very liberating sort of

69
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,280
insight,
um,

70
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,640
because what that means is,
and this,

71
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,600
this sound very unpopular at this
moment,

72
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:41,550
but an economic downturn with all of the
damage and real damage that,

73
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:46,551
that creates,
may not make us as unhappy as we might

74
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:48,114
imagine.

75
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,650
And indeed it might create opportunities
for new ways of life,

76
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,180
for new forms of happiness,
for new ideas of quality of life that we

77
00:04:57,181 --> 00:05:00,590
simply would not have seen,
uh,

78
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,550
when we were in the world of getting
richer and richer and richer and richer

79
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,700
without any reflection whatsoever.
Now,

80
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,700
the Millennium Development Goals are
important,

81
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,880
both morally and economically because
much of the world's population maybe as

82
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,270
much as a third of the world's
population,

83
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,060
hasn't yet reached the level of economic
development where we began to get a

84
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:32,061
dissociation from people's economic
status and their reports about personal

85
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:35,970
happiness.
So we really do need to do much more and

86
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:40,971
much more effectively in order to give
everyone the kind of basis for for which

87
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:42,900
they can have good lives.
