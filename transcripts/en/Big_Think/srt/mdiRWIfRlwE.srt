00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,850
When I was a child growing up,
I expected that we would have robots by

2
00:00:03,851 --> 00:00:07,390
this point c three Po and,
and we still don't,

3
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:11,170
in fact the smartest thing that we have
is the Roomba vacuum cleaner.

4
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:15,090
And so that means it's something went
terribly wrong with ai and,

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,920
and it,
it forces us to ask what went wrong

6
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:21,130
because essentially we've been throwing
the smartest people on the planet at

7
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:24,670
that problem since the 60s and it's been
a failed problem.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,630
Um,
the answer I think clearly is that we

9
00:00:28,631 --> 00:00:30,640
have to listen to what mother nature is
doing.

10
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:33,070
So since the 60s people have thought,
okay,

11
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:34,030
look,
there's all this wet,

12
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:37,440
biological gushy stuff.
Let's put that aside and just figuring

13
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:41,380
out what would intelligence take,
how can we just do this from scratch?

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,160
And that hasn't gotten us anywhere.
The game now is shifting to saying,

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,800
all right,
how is mother nature accomplishing it?

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,850
The reason ai got stuck is because
programmers have been saying,

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,920
look,
how can we solve this part of the

18
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:57,340
problem and then solve this little part
of the problem and this part of the

19
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:58,140
problem.
So if you,

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,540
if you have a robot and you want it to
pick up wooden blocks and stack them,

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,660
programmers have traditionally tried,
okay,

22
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:08,710
let's solve the find the block problem
and then let's,

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,470
once we've done that,
fine solve the pickup,

24
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,240
the block problem,
and then the stack,

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,160
the block problem and so on.
And this sort of division of labor seems

26
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,830
like a pretty good idea,
but it's never really gotten us

27
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,230
anywhere.
The difference with what Mother Nature

28
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:27,280
does is she doesn't come up with
solutions to problems and then tick the

29
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:30,430
box.
The brain is a,

30
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,980
an end product of a chronic process of
reinvention that,

31
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,750
that Mother Nature always does.

32
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,090
So there's no single solution to
anything.

33
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:42,760
Instead,
the brain is this collection of

34
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:47,761
subpopulations that all solve problems
and overlapping ways.

35
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,830
There's no single solution.
So for example,

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,190
um,
the detection of motion by the visual

37
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:57,040
system,
there's not just one way that the brain

38
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,020
does that.
There are multiple ways that were

39
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:02,500
invented at different points in
evolutionary history and they all,

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,070
they all weigh in on the same problem
using different mechanisms.

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,760
Same with memory.
We don't have a single memory system.

42
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,730
There are lots of ways that memories get
written in the brain.

43
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,790
If we want to solve the AI problem,
we have to do at the same way that

44
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,670
Mother Nature did,
which is build a machine that runs on

45
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:23,170
conflict,
that runs on reinventing solutions and

46
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:25,290
having overlapping,
um,

47
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,050
solutions of the problem space.
And that,

48
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:34,051
I think is our best hope for unlogged
jamming the field of artificial

49
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:34,780
intelligence.
