1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,190
Of course there's the old saying,
I forget who said it,

2
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:13,191
but I think it's was turned my life,
which is if at the age of 21,

3
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,750
you,
you're not a socialist,

4
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:18,270
then you don't have any,
any heart.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,463
And if by the age 30,
you still are and then you don't have 

6
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:26,130
any brains.
So that was kind of my experience.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,800
I started out young and idealistic and,
uh,

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,810
social justice and fair distribution of 
resources.

9
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:34,644
And we were,
I didn't understand where everybody 

10
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:41,541
couldn't be equally prosperous.
And starting my own business,

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:43,823
um,
was kind of a wake up call and a number 

12
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:48,540
of different ways.
I had to,

13
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:49,803
I had to meet a payroll every week and 
we had to satisfy customers and we had 

14
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:57,700
competitors that we had to,
uh,

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,440
compete with in order to have those 
customers come into our stores.

16
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:04,470
And we had to compete with other 
employers for our,

17
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,810
uh,
for our employees.

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,673
We had to,
but the wages were under competitive 

19
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:10,344
pressures.
So there was all this competition on us 

20
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:13,470
that,
uh,

21
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,610
that of course made the operating the 
business successfully difficult.

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,253
And it's kind of like having to meet a 
payroll and having to meet the demands 

23
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:23,484
of our customers is a great a destroyer 
of Utopian fantasies and utopia and 

24
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:31,170
utopia and ideologies.
You,

25
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,210
you're in the real world and you have 
to,

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,260
you have to meet the market test every 
day and every week.

27
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:38,094
And I just found that the belief system 
that I had going into operating that 

28
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:43,344
business was,
was inadequate to explain the 

29
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:48,420
experiences that I was having in 
business.

30
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:49,254
And I began to look around and read 
other books and other philosophies to 

31
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:56,424
try and make sense out of,
out of my life and out of my business 

32
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:00,084
experience.
And it was really through encountering 

33
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,663
the,
the free market capitalist philosophies 

34
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:07,260
of,
of,

35
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,600
uh,
of Milton Friedman and,

36
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,950
and,
uh,

37
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,070
Friedrich Hayak and Lou [inaudible] and 
uh,

38
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,290
uh,
and,

39
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,950
and many other,
uh,

40
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,820
free market philosophers that I came to 
realize that this explanation made a lot

41
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:25,194
more sense in my business experience and
made more sense in terms of how the 

42
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:28,860
world really operated.

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,353
And so that's when my worldview began to
shift and I began to let go of being a 

44
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,430
sort of a democratic socialist.

45
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,683
Any type of political ideology is going 
to have a lot of different variants of 

46
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:53,040
it,
a lot of different,

47
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,340
uh,
libertarians are,

48
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,710
are constantly arguing with each,
um,

49
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,250
who's the most pure libertarian and 
who's most Aila,

50
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,330
ideologically pure.
Uh,

51
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,010
I have no real interest in those types 
of discussions or arguments.

52
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,610
And,
uh,

53
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,613
I would,
I resist in one of the strains of 

54
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,094
libertarianism and I reject,
I reject the idea that humankind is 

55
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:21,250
essentially selfish.
That,

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,113
uh,
not only as an observation that we 

57
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:26,470
frequently are selfish,
but there's a strain of belief,

58
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,030
uh,
particularly in the,

59
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,650
in the Ein Rand,
uh,

60
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,003
uh,
part of the movement that the leaves 

61
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:35,050
people ought to be selfish.
That,

62
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,090
that that's a virtue that humans are 
always self interested in.

63
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,160
And all truism is evil and love is,
uh,

64
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,520
is something that makes us weak.
And so I reject that aspect of allude to

65
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,730
libertarianism.
I'm,

66
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,560
um,
I'm a caring,

67
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:58,561
compassionate person and I believe that 
free markets and free minds leads to the

68
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,104
greatest human flourishing.
So I really want humans to flourish and 

69
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:06,364
I believe liberty and market economies 
and capitalism and the best strategies 

70
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:12,694
for full human flourishing.
So I don't identify with that strain of 

71
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:18,750
libertarianism that,
uh,

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,690
uh,
is sort of uncaring and,

73
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:24,100
uh,
uh,

74
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,690
uh,
kind of,

75
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:28,480
uh,
Social Darwinian,

76
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,050
a variant of it.
Um,

77
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,730
I'm very uncomfortable without,
I,

78
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,920
I'm not that way myself.

79
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,480
I do believe that many libertarians are 
animated by a human flourishing.

80
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:44,410
They,
they,

81
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,723
they,
we sincerely believe that human 

82
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:52,330
flourishing is that we need to be free 
and that we need to be creative.

83
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,770
And that through human freedom,
entrepreneurship,

84
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,250
uh,
that humans are creative,

85
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:03,190
they create new ways of,
uh,

86
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:04,024
uh,
of creating value for each other that 

87
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:10,000
expresses itself through the economic 
system and leads to greater prosperity.

88
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:11,650
Not for a few,
but for,

89
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,530
for most people and eventually all 
people.

90
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,560
So there is a strain of,
of,

91
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:21,220
of deep idealism in the libertarian 
movement.

92
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,100
It's again,
sometimes masta over by that,

93
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,160
uh,
that ideology of selfishness.

94
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,310
But,
uh,

95
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,240
the human flourishing element is 
definitely a big aspect of,

96
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,320
uh,
I think of the motivational structure of

97
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:39,790
many,
many libertarian.

98
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:40,624
Certainly it is for me,
I think the zero sum worldview is the 

99
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:51,940
predominant one.
Uh,

100
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:53,830
I think it's,
it's something we've,

101
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,430
we've evolved with this idea that 
there's a,

102
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,613
a limited fixed pie and we have to uh,
distribute that pie and equal fairway 

103
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,770
that no one should get a unfair large 
pieces of that pie.

104
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,030
And if someone is getting a bigger piece
necessarily,

105
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:14,864
someone else may be getting a smaller 
piece since there's a finite amount of 

106
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:20,900
pie to go around.
I also think it's comes from our,

107
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,260
our competitive sports and that in 
competitive sports there's a,

108
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,980
there's a winner and there's a loser.
And so we play games,

109
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:31,814
we play sports all our lives.
So we come to believe that that in the 

110
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:37,214
zero sum worldview,
that summer winters and some are losers 

111
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,490
and in,
and then we can adjust society,

112
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,310
that there should be no losers,
there should be a,

113
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,590
and so we need to,
to,

114
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,663
to limit the,
the pieces of the pie anyone gets so 

115
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:55,790
that everyone can have a fair and just 
piece of the Pie.

116
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,040
And I,
so I reject that.

117
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,200
I don't think there is a,
uh,

118
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,813
necessarily a fixed pie.
The beauty of capitalism and the beauty 

119
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:09,221
of conscious capitalism is the 
realization that the pie can grow that,

120
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,903
that through voluntary exchange in 
through the value creation that happens 

121
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:17,590
when the stakeholders,
uh,

122
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,950
voluntarily cooperate and voluntary 
exchange,

123
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:22,730
which with each other is that,
that the pie grows larger.

124
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,223
And so there is more to distribute and 
that distribution takes place through 

125
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:30,090
the market,
uh,

126
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,860
for the mark to market process is 
through the exchange process as each,

127
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,600
as each of the traders of course wants 
to get a bigger piece for themselves.

128
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:41,870
And competition sort of ultimately 
determines the,

129
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,760
the percentages that each of the 
different constituencies or stakeholders

130
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:51,470
gets in the exchanges.
But that's a growing pie and it's a win,

131
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,310
win,
win,

132
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:53,420
win,
win game.

133
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,990
And that turns me on.
I'm very fired up and excited about that

134
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,800
because it means human flourishing isn't
trapped in some type of,

135
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:04,910
uh,
uh,

136
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,740
limited,
uh,

137
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,360
uh,
set of constraints.

138
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:12,050
It means we can innovate and create our 
ways out of the knee.

139
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,330
These traps in these,
uh,

140
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,560
sort of,
uh,

141
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,170
I can't remember or think of the phrase 
right now.

142
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:19,910
I'm trying to,
I'm trying to recall,

143
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,030
but this idea that we're in some type 
of,

144
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,053
of trap of limited resources and the 
only limitations we have in the 

145
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:33,350
limitations of human creativity,
human imagination and,

146
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,233
uh,
intellectual capital that's been 

147
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:38,690
accumulated as we continue to gain an 
intellectual,

148
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,553
uh,
capital and his human creativity is 

149
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:45,380
unleashed and human entrepreneurship is 
unleashed.

150
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,040
Then the new,
the new innovations,

151
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:52,070
the new creativity that expresses itself
through the marketplace,

152
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:55,470
through capitalism,
allows us to solve that.

153
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:58,030
Previously were thought to be insoluble,
uh,

154
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,180
and human and humans,
uh,

155
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,670
continue on the upward spiral.
I mean,

156
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:04,470
a great example of this is,
is,

157
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,304
uh,
people are very focused oftentimes on 

158
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,154
the fact that there's still a billion 
people on this planet that say live on 

159
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,880
less than a dollar a day.
And that's,

160
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:12,714
uh,
and that's certainly is a terrible 

161
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:14,424
tragedy.
But if you put that in historical 

162
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:20,610
context,
that's about 15% of the people.

163
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,511
Uh,
15,

164
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:22,380
16,
17,

165
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:25,830
less than 20% of the people alive on the
planet live on less than a dollar a day.

166
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,353
Whereas 200 years ago,
85% of the people alive on the planet 

167
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:32,850
earth lived on less than a dollar in 
day.

168
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:35,430
And the US in today's dollars adjusted 
for inflation.

169
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,880
So poverty has always been the default 
condition of the human race.

170
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,020
What's unprecedented is not poverty.
What's unprecedented is wealth.

171
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:51,650
Wealth for not a few,
but prosperity for literally billions of

172
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,090
people every,
every year.

173
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:54,924
Now we see hundreds of millions of 
people escape from poverty just in two 

174
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,880
countries,
China and India.

175
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,240
It is the greatest revolution in human 
prosperity in all of human history.

176
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,690
It's all occurred in the last 20 years.
And it's,

177
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:10,524
it's a,
it's a fact that you almost never see 

178
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:15,930
reported in the media.
Instead,

179
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:19,540
we tend to focus still on there,
on the remaining people that are po,

180
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,190
uh,
that are,

181
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,510
are the rapport and we're back on our 
zero sum gain at some higher nother.

182
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,673
That's because other people are greedy 
and selfish and they're keeping these 

183
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:29,994
poor people down rather than seeing 
poverty lesson through capitalism and 

184
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:36,930
through free market,
uh,

185
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,920
expansion,
uh,

186
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,803
we tend to condemn the very thing that's
allowing people to escape from poverty 

187
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,930
as the cause of the poverty.

188
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,140
And it's ridiculous.
It's a,

189
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,393
the capitalism and free markets or 
what's going to allow us to escape from 

190
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:56,160
poverty.
Muhammad Yunus likes to say that,

191
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,503
that by the end of the 21st century,
poverty will be something that we only 

192
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:04,860
see in museums that,
uh,

193
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,750
it'll be something people look back on 
and say,

194
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,430
Gosh,
we used to have poor people.

195
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,630
How did,
uh,

196
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,463
how is that even possible?
And I do think that's the future of 

197
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:18,060
humanity if we don't totally mess it up,
that we are going to continue to learn.

198
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:20,340
We're going to have our intellectual 
capital spread.

199
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,000
We're going to unleash the human 
creativity,

200
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,953
uh,
because I do believe humans have 

201
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,783
limitless creativity and we're going to 
solve a lot of these problems that are 

202
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:33,420
holding us back now and humanity is 
going to continue to its upward spiral.

203
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,170
And then we're gonna eliminate poverty.
I think there are people alive today.

204
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,433
Uh,
I perhaps will not live to see the end 

205
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:40,254
of it,
but there are young people alive today 

206
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:46,491
that we'll probably see the virtual end 
of poverty in the human race in the 21st

207
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:47,544
century.

208
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,663
From a macro perspective,
conscious capitalism is becoming 

209
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:02,911
conscious of the framework that 
capitalism has to exist him in order to,

210
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:06,220
in order to be successful,
in order to flourish.

211
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:07,054
There certain key principles that that 
have to be in place and we have to 

212
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:14,980
nurture those principles or we won't 
have a capitalistic order.

213
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,460
It's not something that automatically 
exist and has to be.

214
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,030
It has to have principles as to be 
grounded in those principles.

215
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:24,040
And some of those principles include,
um,

216
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,530
uh,
uh,

217
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,393
property rights that we have to have the
right for people to be able to own 

218
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:33,730
property.
At the same time,

219
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:35,980
there needs to be the freedom to 
exchange property.

220
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,933
We need to be able to trade it.
We need to be able to create something 

221
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,220
and then trade it or sell it to someone 
else.

222
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,330
We need,
we need a rule of law.

223
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,373
There needs to be laws that are just,
and laws that are predictable and laws 

224
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:56,680
that apply to everyone in the society,
including the government.

225
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,110
And the rule of law is essential.
You cannot have a,

226
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:03,280
a capitalistic order without the rule of
law.

227
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,353
And it,
whenever that comes into doubt or if 

228
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,580
they're not stable property rights,
you don't really have the,

229
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,020
the basis for the capitalistic order.
And finally you need a,

230
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,660
uh,
uh,

231
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,140
uh,
freedom to trade,

232
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,310
uh,
uh,

233
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,310
usually the greater the,
uh,

234
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,000
the fewer restrictions on their freedom 
to trade across the,

235
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:25,834
uh,
uh,

236
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,873
between people,
but also between people in different 

237
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:31,030
states,
people in different countries,

238
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,630
the,
the greater value creation that occurs.

239
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:37,160
So anytime you see a society that's 
beginning to um,

240
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,673
restrict the ability to trade,
you see a society that is going to 

241
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,054
lessen its prosperity.
It a and P it tends to happen when 

242
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:48,580
people get preoccupied with the loss of 
jobs.

243
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,893
Not Understanding that you may lose some
jobs to a foreign country if you allow 

244
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:59,980
freedom to trade,
but you gaining jobs at the same time,

245
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:00,814
your gain more net jobs because the 
people won't give you their goods for 

246
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,340
free.
They want to trade with you as well.

247
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,203
And so those jobs and the goods that 
they want to trade for the good and 

248
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:12,790
services they want,
that will create greater employment,

249
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,631
uh,
at home.

250
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:17,050
But that's very hard for the average 
person to understand.

251
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,910
And so,
um,

252
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,953
but anyway,
conscious capitalism is understanding 

253
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:22,474
these,
these basic core economic values and 

254
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:28,000
becoming more conscious of them.
Now conscious,

255
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,270
uh,
business is,

256
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,290
is there are certain principles behind 
that.

257
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,124
And one principle is that business has 
the potential for higher purpose that 

258
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,330
uh,
maximizing profits.

259
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,910
If you ask people what the purpose of 
businesses,

260
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:46,744
they usually say,
if you go to a cocktail party and asked 

261
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:49,360
that question,
they'll generally say,

262
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:50,194
well,
everybody knows that the purpose of of 

263
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:55,910
businesses to maximize profits,
it's to maximize shareholder value.

264
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,553
And it's,
but that's a very odd answer because 

265
00:14:59,121 --> 00:14:59,954
that's not the answer we would give if 
you asked what the purpose of a doctor 

266
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:02,804
is to heal the sick or what the purpose 
of it teacher is to educate people or 

267
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,683
what the purpose of lawyer is or what 
the purpose of an architect is or what 

268
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:12,860
the purpose of an engineer is.
So,

269
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,023
so why is it that we would come to this 
on answer that the purpose of business 

270
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:17,654
is to maximize profits.
When I have known literally hundreds of 

271
00:15:21,471 --> 00:15:23,930
entrepreneurs in my life,
and with very few exceptions,

272
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,910
very few of them actually created their 
businesses to try to maximize profits.

273
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,880
Of course they need to make money,
but that's,

274
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,840
I need to eat in order to live,
I need to breathe in order to live.

275
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:36,674
I need my,
I need to create red blood cells in 

276
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:38,930
order to live.

277
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,630
But that's not the purpose of my life to
eat,

278
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,510
to breathe,
to create red blood cells.

279
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,210
Uh,
I haven't much more transcendent purpose

280
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:48,044
in my life.
That gives my life meaning and value to 

281
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:51,410
it.
Business is no different.

282
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,610
Um,
uh,

283
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,730
business has the potential for a higher 
and deeper purpose.

284
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,310
And that's the first principle of 
conscious business.

285
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,323
Second principle is,
is that there's a variety of 

286
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,790
stakeholders that are interdependent,
that are connected together,

287
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,220
customers,
employees,

288
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:09,440
suppliers,
investors,

289
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,190
communities,
both local and larger communities.

290
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,443
And then the larger environment that 
were part of those are the most 

291
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:18,890
important stake holders.
There are other stakeholders that are in

292
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:21,150
like an form of wider circle such as,
uh,

293
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,760
uh,
the government,

294
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,170
uh,
labor unions,

295
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,380
uh,
the media activists of various kinds.

296
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:29,650
But the idea being that,
um,

297
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,003
these stakeholders are interdependent on
one another and that the conscious 

298
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:35,294
business attempts to create value 
simultaneously for all of these 

299
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:42,350
interdependent stakeholders that it 
seeks to win,

300
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:43,970
win,
win business strategy.

301
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,223
That in maybe a way to explain that in a
simple model version is a retail 

302
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:50,620
business,
which whole foods is,

303
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,910
is that,
um,

304
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,940
management's job is to help our,
is to hire good people,

305
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,560
train them well and helped him to be 
happy and fulfilled in their workplace,

306
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,423
in their work and their jobs.
And then the team member's job is to 

307
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,193
satisfy our customers,
help the customers to be happy in their 

308
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:13,004
exchanges with the business.
So happy team members leads to happy 

309
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:20,210
customers and happy customers,
do more business with the,

310
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:22,220
uh,
with the company and that leads to happy

311
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:23,054
investors.
So you have a virtuous circle of happy 

312
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,910
team members,
happy customers,

313
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:30,800
happy investors,
uh,

314
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,663
that reflects in a simplified version,
this idea of the interdependent nature 

315
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:36,494
of the stakeholders and why you can't 
just focus on creating value for the 

316
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:40,274
investors alone because you must create 
value for the team members who then 

317
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:49,530
create value for the customers who then 
create value for the investors.

318
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,130
So,
um,

319
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,133
the conscious business is,
recognizes as conscious of it and works 

320
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,610
to optimize value for all of the key 
independent,

321
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,110
independent,
or dependent stakeholders.

322
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,413
Third principle of the conscious 
business is what we call conscious 

323
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:09,330
leadership.
Or you might also think of it as servant

324
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:13,050
leadership that,
that the leaders of the organization,

325
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,213
they're not there to line their pockets 
and try to maximize their own personal 

326
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:19,320
gain.
Instead,

327
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,920
they're job is to fulfill the higher 
purpose of the business,

328
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,653
recognize and fulfill the interdependent
stakeholder model and in a sense to 

329
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:33,120
serve the organization to um,
uh,

330
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,343
sublimate their own ego and their own 
ambitions for the good of the 

331
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:39,000
organization.
And again,

332
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:43,050
it's not self sacrificial or I'm not 
talking about altruism,

333
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,273
I'm talking about recognizing that in 
the long term they will also gain the 

334
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:48,624
most through the flourishing of the 
business and through flourishing of all 

335
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,300
the stakeholders,
they too will flourish,

336
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,720
that their identity is linked and their 
own,

337
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,913
um,
their own gain is linked to the gain of 

338
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:02,850
all these other stakeholders.

339
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,223
And then the fourth principle is,
is that to realize these first three 

340
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:08,340
principles,
you have to create a culture,

341
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:12,630
a conscious culture that has strategies,
structures,

342
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,720
and processes that create a culture that
optimizes the stakeholder model,

343
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:27,621
fills the purpose and allows the 
conscious leadership to do their jobs.

344
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,643
So the culture provides that background 
and the processes and structures that 

345
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:37,800
the conscious business needs in order 
to,

346
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,290
uh,
to achieve its highest potential.

347
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,990
So when you add those four principles 
together,

348
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:47,550
you have a conscious business.
When you add the conscious business with

349
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:48,384
the key principles of the,
of the conscious of the conscious 

350
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:52,824
capitalism,
you truly have the larger ecosystem of 

351
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:58,614
the conscious capitalistic society,
one with conscious businesses that are 

352
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:08,250
changing in a consciously a capitalistic
way.

353
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,160
You've just articulated what I call the 
tradeoff myth.

354
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,443
Um,
the belief that all this sounds very 

355
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:22,680
good,
very idealistic,

356
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:25,170
but it won't compete well in the 
marketplace.

357
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,060
And when it runs up against,
say,

358
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,810
a business that's not handicapped with 
this,

359
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:32,370
uh,
idealism,

360
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:35,940
then it'll be in trouble.
Nothing could be further from the truth.

361
00:20:35,941 --> 00:20:36,774
It's exact opposite that in fact,
the conscious business has competitive 

362
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:44,640
advantage.
When you work from a higher purpose,

363
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,853
you,
you unleash greater degrees of 

364
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:53,911
commitment to greater degrees of loyalty
and greater creativity in the workplace.

365
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,683
And that gives competitive advantage.
When you work from the stakeholder 

366
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,730
model,
um,

367
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,010
you understand that you're trying to 
optimize the entire system.

368
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,540
You're able to do that in such a way is 
when you optimize the entire system,

369
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,110
you also optimize the,
the,

370
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,123
the value that you also,
you're creating for the investors as 

371
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:14,284
well.
The business tends to flourish at a 

372
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:16,960
higher level.

373
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:17,973
So in fact,
the conscious business will win in most 

374
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,450
instances.
All other things being equal,

375
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:29,140
it will win in competition against less 
conscious businesses.

376
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,140
And that's why I'm confident that over 
the long term,

377
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,260
conscious capitalism is going to 
triumph.

378
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,133
It will,
I believe it will become the New 

379
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:36,970
Paradigm,
uh,

380
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,940
in the 21st century.
Eh,

381
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:39,963
not because it's,
it's more idealistic or it sounds 

382
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:44,044
better.
It'll become the dominant paradigm 

383
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:45,934
simply because it will win.
It will win in the marketplace and 

384
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,600
nothing succeeds in capitalism more than
success itself.

385
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,900
So good ideas that work spread and the 
competitive nature of the marketplace is

386
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,224
going to lead to these competitions 
between conscious businesses and less 

387
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:10,450
conscious businesses and uh,
uh,

388
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,990
the conscious businesses,
all other things being equal,

389
00:22:12,991 --> 00:22:14,650
we're going to win most of those 
battles.

390
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,400
And so fairly quickly,
meaning when I say quickly,

391
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:20,500
I mean 25,
30,

392
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:21,334
35 years,
we're going to see more and more and 

393
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:23,974
more conscious businesses and we will 
make this shift towards conscious 

394
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:27,580
capitalistic society.

395
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,713
My first instinct is to tell you that I 
do think retail is one of the first 

396
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:39,070
areas to shift.
Um,

397
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,340
possibly because they are dealing with 
their customers,

398
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,293
uh,
on a day to day basis and they've got 

399
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:50,710
their more labor intensive as well.
They tend to hire and employ more people

400
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,270
like whole foods,
market employees,

401
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,680
57,000
people.

402
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,690
So we're,
um,

403
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,250
and we have millions of customers.
So in a sense,

404
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,263
uh,
and we're in a extremely competitive 

405
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:04,150
marketplace,
food retailing,

406
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:04,984
and we don't have any patents.
We don't have any in the government's 

407
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,690
not protecting a US in some way from 
competition.

408
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:11,524
So,
and we have formidably competitors are 

409
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:14,830
much larger than,
than us.

410
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:17,200
So like Walmart,
Kroger,

411
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,060
safe way,
companies like that.

412
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:20,740
So,
uh,

413
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,240
retail,
uh,

414
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,343
is one of the first areas to shift.
And many of the conscious businesses 

415
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:29,290
that I know tend to be either retailers 
or service businesses,

416
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,124
companies like the container store or 
costco or starbucks or the southwest 

417
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:36,700
airlines.

418
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,670
Um,
uh,

419
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,840
the,
these are,

420
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,100
um,
uh,

421
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,063
are businesses that trader Joe's,
these are businesses that our retailers 

422
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,370
we're service oriented.
So I do think maybe the conscious,

423
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:52,640
a conscious business revolution,
conscious capitalism,

424
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,050
Ra revolution,
we'll see that take hold in a more large

425
00:23:57,051 --> 00:24:00,020
scale way in the retail and service.
First.

426
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,810
I can predict also possibly what will be
last.

427
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,930
I predict possibly Wall Street will be 
last,

428
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,430
uh,
or the,

429
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,820
uh,
pure financial part of our economy,

430
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,180
which to a greater extent it steak,
it doesn't have as much of a stakeholder

431
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,280
model.
It does tend to be dominated by the,

432
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,690
the,
uh,

433
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,823
profit,
profit maximization model and 

434
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:26,084
shareholder return model to a greater 
degree than other segments of our 

435
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:33,800
society.
So I suspect retail and services will be

436
00:24:33,801 --> 00:24:36,680
first and the financial sector will be 
last.

437
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,060
I do think that,
um,

438
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:50,530
the economy is going to continue to 
evolve towards a more service.

439
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,733
Uh,
the human beings are doing more things 

440
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,630
to serve one another in terms of 
services.

441
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,270
Uh,
uh,

442
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,440
but the new things or if you think about
the whole technology area,

443
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,900
so much of that didn't even exist 10,
15 years ago.

444
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,310
There was no facebook,
there was no google,

445
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,710
there was no ipods or no i-phones.
Uh,

446
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,780
really blackberries didn't even exist 15
years ago.

447
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:18,614
So,
so many different things change so 

448
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:22,560
rapidly,
uh,

449
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,330
and new industries and whole industries 
can be created fairly,

450
00:25:26,331 --> 00:25:28,250
fairly quickly.
Um,

451
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,773
I think it's safe to say that we're 
going to see greater innovations in 

452
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:33,674
education.
That here's an area that needs radical 

453
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:39,980
innovation,
that we don't allow competition,

454
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,340
we don't allow,
we haven't unleashed human creativity.

455
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:44,174
So education potentially if we could and
monopolize education and truly allow 

456
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:52,450
entrepreneurs to get going on that,
uh,

457
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,500
that can't think of hardly healthcare 
and education are the two most regulated

458
00:25:58,371 --> 00:26:00,320
areas in our society.

459
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,700
And they're also the ones that are most 
or least satisfactory to people.

460
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,940
Those are areas that we need to to d 
monopolize and allow more competition to

461
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:13,400
occur.
So those are two huge areas,

462
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:15,730
education,
uh,

463
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,720
and healthcare,
both service areas.

464
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:22,721
So those are growth industries also 
think all types of leisure travel is a,

465
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:28,160
as a,
as a society becomes more fluent.

466
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,490
It's,
it's desire to travel a increases and to

467
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:34,400
explore that.
The younger generation today,

468
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,680
people that are in their twenties,
for example,

469
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,070
they have traveled so much more than my 
generation had.

470
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,233
I mean for me a big deal when I was in 
my twenties and going down Mexico and 

471
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,190
that was like the foreign country or 
maybe you get up to Canada,

472
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:50,280
but today people haven't just gone to 
Europe.

473
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,533
Uh,
but they've gone all over the world by 

474
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:55,320
the time they're 30 years old.
If they're young and well educated,

475
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:56,154
they,
they've world travel is going to be 

476
00:26:57,781 --> 00:26:59,610
continued to be a,
uh,

477
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,210
it's a goal in particular as 
globalization continues to occur,

478
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:04,500
we're going to continue to explore.

479
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,500
Also think I'm a huge,
huge possibilities and entertainment.

480
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,753
I mean,
look how much entertainment has evolved 

481
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:14,790
and shifted.
Uh,

482
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:20,160
in a sense,
something like big think it's education,

483
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:21,930
it's entertainment.
Uh,

484
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,273
it's a,
it's a synthesis of those two and it's 

485
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:25,764
probably got lots of other things in it 
as well that I haven't just picked up 

486
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:29,130
yet.
Um,

487
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,550
I do see lots more creativity,
loss,

488
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:35,340
more innovations,
lots of more entrepreneurship around,

489
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:40,290
uh,
around entertainment and a human's,

490
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,190
uh,
uh,

491
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,870
educating one,
another entertaining one,

492
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:45,570
another serving one another,
uh,

493
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,750
new ways for humans to enjoy life,
new ways for humans to learn and grow.

494
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,820
Uh,
uh,

495
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,783
we are going to continually try to 
figure out ways to serve ourselves 

496
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:00,210
better.
And,

497
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,380
uh,
uh,

498
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,023
it's,
it's amazing how even think about 

499
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:09,651
something like [inaudible] I didn't 
exist in any kind of scale 25 years ago.

500
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,840
Yoga existed,
but hardly anybody did it.

501
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,273
Now you see those are,
or activities that are also leading to 

502
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:17,034
greater human flourishing through 
helping humans to be a more fit and 

503
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:23,460
stronger.
Uh,

504
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,753
the more flexible.
So it's fascinating watching the world 

505
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,240
and watching humans,
uh,

506
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,010
uh,
evolve and watching our society evolve.

507
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,873
It's,
uh,

508
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,080
uh,
uh,

509
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:37,751
I love it.
I'm,

510
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:40,050
I'm,
I'm so glad to be part of it and to have

511
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,940
contributed a little bit to it myself.
