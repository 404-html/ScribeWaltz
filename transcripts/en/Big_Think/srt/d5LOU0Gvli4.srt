1
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,550
I think that the United States should
use the power it has at its disposal to

2
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,040
first of all,
protect itself and protect its

3
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:24,550
interests,
but then to the extent that we can try

4
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:27,850
to create a more stable and more orderly
world.

5
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:32,350
The problem is there's not very much we
can do on that front in what separates

6
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:33,850
me from,
you know,

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,870
many other people who work in the field
of American foreign policy is I think

8
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:42,871
there are real limits to our capacity to
shape other societies that is not our

9
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:48,241
business or within our capacity to
dictate how other societies are going to

10
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:51,860
run.
I think that's their job and we're.

11
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:54,430
If we try to do it,
we're going to screw it up far more

12
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:55,630
often than we're going to succeed.
