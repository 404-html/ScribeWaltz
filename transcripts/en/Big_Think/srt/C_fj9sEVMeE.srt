1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,250
So a few years ago I went to go and
investigate rumors of hippos,

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,310
rogue hippos running riot it,
rural Columbia.

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,080
Now,
hippos don't naturally live in South

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,620
America.
They are from sub Saharan Africa and,

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,190
but these hippos had been transported to
Columbia by Pablo Escobar.

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,480
So Pablo Escobar,
like many powerful men,

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,480
fancied himself as a bit of a,
a Noah's Ark,

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,030
a kind of twisted,
no,

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,430
in fact,
and he wanted to build his own menagerie

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,990
at a Hacienda Napoli's,
which was his ranch where he controlled

11
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:50,670
his drug empire in between a Bogota
metagene in the,

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,900
uh,
in the Andes,

13
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:55,740
in Colombia.
And legend has it that he gathered

14
00:00:55,741 --> 00:01:00,420
together this menagerie by stealing a
Russian cargo plane,

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,960
flying it,
or having it flown to Africa where he

16
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:08,160
loaded it up with loads of illegal
wildlife and it had to get it back to

17
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:11,160
Columbia before the tranquilizer animals
woke up.

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,710
Um,
and uh,

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,740
amongst this cargo of creatures was a
one male hippo that was nicknamed Lva,

20
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:23,970
Ho and three females.

21
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,810
And he transplanted these enormous piece
into a pond at his Hacienda.

22
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,420
And they loved it.
It turns out that Columbia is a hippo

23
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:41,421
paradise because actually all hippos
really want is some nice shallow water

24
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:45,630
to wallow around in and plenty of grass
to eat.

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,610
And Columbia has plenty of that and it
also has no other hippos,

26
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,520
so no other competition and no natural
predators.

27
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,720
So the hippos flourished,
uh,

28
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,520
in their,
in their new paradise.

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,660
And very quickly the four became eight,
became 12,

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,840
became 16.
And what happens with hippos is you have

31
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:13,680
a male who has a heart team.
So every time one of Lva,

32
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:18,681
hose sons reach sexual maturity,
he would boot him out of the pond and

33
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,020
that a young male hippo would then head
off in search of hippo love elsewhere.

34
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,430
Now,
of course in Africa,

35
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:29,470
this is completely normal.
Hippos head off from there,

36
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,290
their family group and young males will
go in search of hippo love,

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,840
uh,
and uh,

38
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,710
and,
and,

39
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,250
and start their own family.

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,390
But of course in Columbia there are no
hippos out there.

41
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,560
So these males,
these young males are being spirited

42
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:49,770
away from Hacienda Napoli's in one of
the many,

43
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:54,000
many rivers in that part of Columbia,
which acts like sort of hippo

44
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:57,330
superhighway.
So they're sort of pinging them out into

45
00:02:57,331 --> 00:03:02,331
the countryside and they arrive and they
can't find a mate.

46
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,420
So they,
they quite cantankerous piece the best

47
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,390
of times.
But these are sorts of front frustrated,

48
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,470
hoardy male hippos,
desperately looking for love where there

49
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:15,610
is none.
Um,

50
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,980
I,
I went to Columbia to investigate this

51
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:22,981
story and visited one of these rogue
males that had installed himself in a

52
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,910
pond next to a kindergarten.
Uh,

53
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,190
I've met the kids from the school who
told me that they no longer liked to

54
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:37,681
bathe in that particular pond to right.
And one of them told me about how his

55
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:41,800
grandmother had been chased by the,
uh,

56
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,540
love lawn beast for quite some time,
the earlier in the week.

57
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,600
Um,
so they,

58
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,220
they are,
they,

59
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,250
they're kind of running a mock
basically.

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,360
So,
you know,

61
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,970
what do you do with this situation?
You've got,

62
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,430
you know,
rapidly multiplying hippos.

63
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,230
And the extraordinary thing about what's
happening in Columbia is it's changing

64
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:07,231
their behavior because in Africa you
have this very fierce dry season,

65
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:08,090
which,
you know,

66
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,310
puts the brakes on hippo reproduction.
So I think they,

67
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,460
they reach sexual maturity,
you know,

68
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:16,450
I don't know,
I can't remember.

69
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:17,130
It's like,
Eh,

70
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,180
at five or seven years,
let's say.

71
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,290
But in Colombia they were reaching
sexual maturity significantly earlier

72
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,950
and having babies every year instead of
every two years.

73
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:31,150
So they were multiplying at this much
faster rate because they didn't have the

74
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:33,640
same constraints on them that they do in
Africa.

75
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,240
So you've got a bit of a problem.
You've got a massive invasive species

76
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:45,270
now with most invasive species,
the solution is to get rid of them

77
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,300
because basically they upset ecosystems
and,

78
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,120
and so they need to be removed.

79
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,600
And the problem with hippos though is
that they store in Disney movies.

80
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:03,180
So there is this sort of rogue male,
uh,

81
00:05:03,181 --> 00:05:05,350
and the first one that they,
they,

82
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:06,970
uh,
they put down,

83
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,860
it was a public outcry.
And so they had to come up with a

84
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,920
different plan.
And I met with the Colombian vet who was

85
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:21,730
in charge of implementing the radical
plan B,

86
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,880
which was the castration program.
So Carlos Valderrama was given the

87
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,840
onerous task of having to cast straight
one of these rogue males.

88
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:40,081
Now this I'm sure you can appreciate as
a job that takes a fair amount of coneys

89
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,320
because castrating a wild male,
hippo is no easy task.

90
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:52,150
It is actually unbelievably complicated.
First of all,

91
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,510
I'm hippos because they've got so much
fat,

92
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,350
they're really hard to anesthetize
because the anesthetic dissolves in the

93
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:02,840
fat.
So even though they're enormous,

94
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,820
you have to get the dosage right.

95
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,410
They also,
when they're nervous,

96
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,960
they go into water,
you don't want it to pass out in the

97
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:12,620
water because it's going to drown.
Then when you finally managed to a nice,

98
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:14,690
it's Carlos sits,
me had.

99
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,640
And also they really,
really,

100
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:19,580
really aggressive.
And then Carlos told me that he had

101
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,380
decoys,
cowboys and,

102
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,580
and all sorts of shenanigans to try and
just to get through the anesthetics

103
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,220
stage.
Then the clock was on.

104
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,580
They had a certain amount of time in
order to complete the,

105
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:33,200
uh,
the castration.

106
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,910
Now,
the thing about hippos is they are the

107
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:40,550
closest relative of the hippo is the
whale.

108
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,660
They have internal testicles that are
buried underneath about eight inches of

109
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:50,210
skin and fat.
Not only that,

110
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:55,390
but hippo testicles have a habit of
wandering about when under threat they

111
00:06:55,581 --> 00:07:00,581
can move as much as eight centimeters.
So you're looking at a blank canvas

112
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:02,840
behind which there is a moving target.

113
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,190
Now,
when you get in there,

114
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,000
they're the size of cantaloupes,
but just getting to them and working out

115
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:11,990
where to make the incision and then
managing to grab hold of these moving

116
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:16,991
melons and getting them out
was quite some task and it's apparently

117
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:22,900
it took him about six hours and uh,
it cost

118
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,600
well over $100,000.
So,

119
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,540
you know,
I think they've managed to do one more.

120
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,230
I subsequently,
but they're never going to.

121
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,570
It's just,
it's too difficult.

122
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:39,200
They're never going to be able to
castrate all the males.

123
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:42,650
That's just not going to happen.
What I think's going to happen is we're

124
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:45,590
going to have a,
a new subspecies of Colombian hippo

125
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,890
before too long hippopotamus Escobar,
Chris,

126
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,740
um,
because that's how you make a new

127
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:55,010
species you take,
you put it in isolation from its parent

128
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:58,040
species and,
and it evolves into a slightly

129
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,140
different,
different species.

130
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,620
And that's what's going to happen.
The hippo is always being quoted as

131
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:06,490
being Africa's most dangerous animal.
Now I,

132
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:10,160
I did some digging around and I've never
really been able to find out the source

133
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:12,320
of this fact,
but I can tell you,

134
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,640
having been charged by a hippo myself,
they are really,

135
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,410
really,
really dangerous.

136
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:19,170
I mean,
they,

137
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,220
they do kill people.
They are extremely aggressive.

138
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,560
They move really fast.
The,

139
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:26,690
uh,
the mail that we went to go and film the

140
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:28,880
rogue male in Columbia,
he,

141
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:31,520
uh,
we got a little bit too close and he was

142
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:36,020
in his pond and he came towards us with
such velocity that they were barrel

143
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:37,880
waves coming off his,
uh,

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,760
coming off as nosy hurtled through the
water.

145
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,270
Uh,
it was pretty terrifying.

146
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,080
I can tell you.
So the thing about hippos is they are

147
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,290
there,
they're really dangerous.

148
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:52,280
So
they're dangerous to humans in Columbia

149
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,370
who don't understand how dangerous they
are because culturally they haven't

150
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:57,780
grown up alongside hippos.

151
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,390
I've seen them in Disney films.
They think they're chubby and cute.

152
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,180
Carlos told me that this is,
this is a real issue,

153
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,110
but also of course they all ecosystem
engineers.

154
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,450
One of the things about hippos is that
they,

155
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,820
you know,
they're big animals,

156
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:16,710
they churn up a lot of vegetation.
They have the power to reshape their

157
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:21,660
environment and it's this reshaping of
the environment that was.

158
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,740
That was most alarming to cow call style
drama because he was worried that other

159
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,080
native species that share the rivers,
like manatees for instance,

160
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,260
we would suffer with hippos being
around.
