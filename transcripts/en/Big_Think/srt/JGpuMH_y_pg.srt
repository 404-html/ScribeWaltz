1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,610
Dave chappelle.
Dave's my God brother.

2
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,690
So I'm a bit biased and we came of age
together in New York City,

3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,120
being in college and him at the Boston
Comedy Club,

4
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,640
which is a college of sorts for him.
Um,

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,430
I was actually known to some as Dave's
Puerto Rican bodyguard because,

6
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,650
uh,
they didn't,

7
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:28,970
they didn't know exactly what to make
of,

8
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:30,770
of the,
of the guy who didn't smile much and

9
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:32,930
just sat in the back of the club club
reading books.

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,760
Uh,
they didn't realize that that was at

11
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:36,440
Columbia University.
And the only way I can have the

12
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:40,250
privilege hanging out the comedy club as
if I actually read books while somebody

13
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:42,010
else was telling jokes.
So say,

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:42,980
yeah,
Dave.

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,390
Dave's definitely my favorite comic.

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,120
Okay.
