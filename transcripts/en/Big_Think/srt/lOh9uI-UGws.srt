1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,420
It is very difficult to it on the same
thing.

2
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:15,030
It's like a person wants to stop
smoking,

3
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:17,850
right?
They're addicted to smoking and he's not

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,410
so hard to stop one,
two,

5
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:23,070
three days.
But most people will relapse after two

6
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:24,360
or three days.
The same thing with,

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,840
with uh,
with diets and food for once these,

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,120
these changes that'll cure these
condition responses.

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,150
Number one are long lasting.
So you are going to be constantly

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,030
inhibiting these pre potent,
uh,

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,090
nice to actually want to it.
Now Imagine Your Day,

12
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:50,220
24 hours.
I sort of sorts of the managing my day

13
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:54,300
24 hours in the morning and go run
exercise.

14
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:58,260
I'm all all wired up so I have perfect
control.

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,290
Nothing bad has happened to me.
But then I basic alley loose,

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,280
loose my key on,
I have to make these huge line and then

17
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:11,220
the secretary insults me and I have to
say,

18
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:11,611
no,
no,

19
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:11,851
no,
no,

20
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:12,684
no,
I'm not going to get.

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,500
So you start to get frustrated.
I'm frustrated and frustrated and angry

22
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:21,501
and angry and your ability to then
regulate this urge to eat the food

23
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,810
starts to be on their mind.
So as we get frustrated,

24
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,430
as we get stressed,
our ability to exert control gets

25
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:35,790
diminished.
So you're going to die then this is one,

26
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,980
one of the reasons is not the only
reason,

27
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,080
and I'll,
I'll come back to it in a second.

28
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,590
The ability to exert control,
to control our emotions and our

29
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:49,770
behaviors gets eroded when we're
stressed,

30
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,430
when we're tired or actually when we're
full deprived and that's why people

31
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:58,530
become irritable.
This is actually,

32
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,560
it's a response where your,
your brain,

33
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:06,561
your body sensing that you are in a
state of deprivation and under a state

34
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:12,321
of the premade Bayesian,
your main full state changes to go and

35
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:15,930
want to do that behavior that will get
you out of that state.

36
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,230
So you have again that balance of an
intense drive to get out of that very

37
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:24,930
unpleasant state and on the other one
your cognition and says,

38
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,050
I want to lose weight,
I want to lose weight and there is a

39
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:32,600
point that you do lose.
You lose this battle and so you give in

40
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:35,970
and you get a stressor comes up.
The flight has been canceled.

41
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:40,500
I've been dealing with all of these,
these psych had a bad day on my flight

42
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:44,880
on top of everything gets canceled.
And at that moment you lose the ability

43
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:46,890
to control.
So that's one of the things I need to,

44
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,860
exactly the same thing with drugs or
weed smoking behavior.

45
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,240
A person he's doing fine and all of a
sudden their spouse says,

46
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,300
you know,
I want the divorce when they have been

47
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:59,710
stopped smoking and then they relapse.
Something very,

48
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,690
very stressful.
They lose that ability.

49
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,790
There are all other things that,
that are um,

50
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,693
being,
um,

51
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,450
shown by animal stories that may also
being very,

52
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,070
very provocative.
And again,

53
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,380
this is at the research level in
animals.

54
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:17,350
It hasn't been shown in humans,
but in my view,

55
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:20,560
the moment that I started to see results
like that in animals,

56
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,870
I want to question,
is this happening in humans?

57
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,040
There's been a series of stories now by
Dr Hobble,

58
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,810
uh,
for many years.

59
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,320
And I,
I,

60
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,030
when I read these I said,
wow,

61
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,290
where he takes rods on key,
gives them a diet high in sure we'll,

62
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,450
we'll eat the societies a lot of sugar.
Well,

63
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:42,640
he takes these little ruts and gives
them high amounts of sugar and then he

64
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:47,641
takes these animals and gives them,
I draw that we call an opiate antagonist

65
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,690
now.
Why do you say an opiate?

66
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:51,970
The Taiwanese and not being a townie.

67
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,860
Some medication that when you give to a
rat only when you give it to a rod that

68
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:01,861
has been repeatedly exposed to opiates
like I'm caroline.

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,540
Morphine,
oxycontin,

70
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,850
repeated exposure only when it's
repeated,

71
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,620
you gave that you trigger,
I withdraw like a heroin withdraw.

72
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,450
The animus satish shatters.
It's gets to shake and a,

73
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:18,490
it's very,
very unpleasant for the animal.

74
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,070
When a kid these these opiate antagonist
into an animal that has been exposed to

75
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:28,120
high content of sugar,
he triggers an opiate withdraw.

76
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,110
This is incredibly unpleasant.
Now,

77
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,950
one of the things that we haven't
studied in humans is could there be

78
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:40,951
something similar that they're eas are
we draw out just like it's been shown in

79
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:46,681
animals or Kurian when a person is a
stops in a diet and then they basically

80
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:52,981
are courting the intake of sugar which
liberates endogenous opiates,

81
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,300
so no longer those endogenous opiates
are being liberated and your creating a

82
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:03,301
mile state of withdraw that he's not of
course so powerful that you recognize

83
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:07,060
it,
but that may be creating this state of

84
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,830
dysphoria and discomfort.

85
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,190
This is artifactually factually,
which is what happens when you put

86
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:15,100
someone on on withdrawal.
Maya withdrawal from opiates.

87
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:16,900
It's not like they're going to start
shaking,

88
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,850
but there's a sense of discomfort.
It's just you're not feeling well on

89
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,120
your Stinger like like that and it's
very unpleasant.

90
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,140
And so the,
the extent to which a similar process,

91
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:31,540
for example,
maybe happening is something that should

92
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:35,410
be investigated that could also,
if proven correct,

93
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,210
help to understand why so very difficult
to go into a diet.

94
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,880
And we'll also,
if it's again,

95
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,390
a document that in humans,
because this is documented in animals,

96
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,120
could provide a strategist to help so
on,

97
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,100
so that they don't have these very,
these very disagreeable state of

98
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:54,730
discomfort.
