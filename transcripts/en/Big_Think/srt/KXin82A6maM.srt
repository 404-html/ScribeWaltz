1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,680
There's no doubt that the Internet is
creating what is called an intelligent

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:08,130
planet.
That is the skin of the planet earth is

3
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:12,240
becoming a network by which intelligent
creatures communicate with each other,

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,860
but that's just the first step.
Some people think that the next step in

5
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:19,530
the coming decades is not going to be
the internet.

6
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:23,700
It's going to be brain net because we're
at the point now where we can actually

7
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:27,390
connect computers to the living mine.
In fact,

8
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:31,050
I was just at Berkeley a few weeks ago
where I had a demonstration of this.

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,620
We can actually create videos of your
thoughts.

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,660
These videos are not perfectly accurate,
but I saw a demonstration a at a

11
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:44,280
laboratory at Berkeley where you can
actually see in a video screen what

12
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:48,390
people are thinking.
So with electrodes perhaps or eeg

13
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:51,210
sensors in a helmet connected to our
brain,

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,040
perhaps one day we'll be able to have
brain to brain communication and that

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,650
gives us the possibility of brain net.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,140
In fact,
some of the leading neurologists doing

17
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:05,640
these experiments have sear released to
propose a braid net whereby you would

18
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:10,641
exchange not just information like
typing but also emotions,

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,250
feelings because these are also part of
the fabric of our thoughts and then what

20
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:19,560
comes beyond that.
Well of course,

21
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:23,490
beyond that is science fiction and
science fiction gives us all sorts of

22
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:28,290
horror stories of things like skynet.
Maybe one day the Internet will become

23
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,320
sentient.
Maybe one day the Internet will think

24
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:36,240
that humans are in the way and perhaps
the Internet will take over just like in

25
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:38,460
the terminator series.
Well,

26
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,660
I don't think so.
The Internet is simply a way in which

27
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,690
minds can communicate with other minds.
We see no self awareness in the

28
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:50,460
Internet.
Now some people say,

29
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:53,100
well,
what about some kind of collective

30
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:56,640
consciousness that arises by an emergent
phenomenon?

31
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,980
Well,
that's a lot of Gobbledygook.

32
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,530
That's a lot of nice words.
Maybe,

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,770
maybe not,
but it's pure speculation at the present

34
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:07,890
time,
even in the laboratory with our finest

35
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,070
instruments and the latest developments
in artificial intelligence,

36
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,460
we cannot make a computer become self
aware.

37
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,430
You realize that one of our most
advanced computers,

38
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,620
uh,
was the IBM Computer Watson,

39
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,090
which defeated two humans on the the
program jeopardy.

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,460
At that point,
many pundits said,

41
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:29,040
oh my God,
the end is near.

42
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,210
The robots are going to put us in zoos.
They're going to throw a peanut status,

43
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:36,360
make us dance behind bars when they take
over.

44
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,540
Just like we make bear's dance behind
bars today.

45
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,100
Well,
just remember that once,

46
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:44,100
then,
no matter how fast it is,

47
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,280
was so stupid.
You couldn't congratulate it.

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,480
You can't go up to Watson,
slap it's transitions and say,

49
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,110
good boy,
you just be two humans on jeopardy.

50
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,600
You made history.
Let's drink to it.

51
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,090
You see,
Watson is an adding machine,

52
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,700
a very sophisticated adding machine.
It has billings of times faster than the

53
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:09,550
human brain,
but that's all it is.

54
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,960
It's what it's called an expert system.
It deals with formalized inputs,

55
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,350
formalized outputs.
You talk to an expert system every time

56
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,510
you're on the telephone and the
telephone says,

57
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:23,200
please hit button one,
please hit number two for the next

58
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:25,510
option.
That's called an expert system.

59
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,000
It's basically a sophisticated adding
machine.

60
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,020
That sounds like it's thinking,
but it's not.

61
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,220
It's simply using a formalized logic.
If you hit one,

62
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,290
then you go there.
If he had to,

63
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,840
you go someplace else.
That's Watson,

64
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:41,740
of course,
on a very,

65
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:45,640
very sophisticated level.
So I personally think that we don't have

66
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:48,580
to worry that the Internet is going to
become sentient.

67
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:52,430
Okay.
