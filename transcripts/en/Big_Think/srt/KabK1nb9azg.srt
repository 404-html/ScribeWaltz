1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,710
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,330
Paul Haggis is a wonderful writer.
Uh,

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,060
uh,
Akiva Goldsman is another one,

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,150
uh,
a doctorate at Pixar,

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,710
but I don't really have favorites and
um,

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,400
um,
it's not like rock and roll,

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,900
it just isn't where you can pick a
favorite and,

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,580
and,
and see that they're doing something

9
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:37,440
really innovative in music and it comes
out,

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,940
you know,
every six months there's a song or album

11
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:44,941
or whatever.
It's not like that because the time

12
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:50,131
between starting up a screenplay or a
novel or a play and actually seeing it

13
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:55,430
on stage page or screen is years of,
of uh,

14
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,760
of development and work and it goes on.
I'm over long periods of time.

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,870
And so it's not.
There was,

16
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,300
there was a time back when,
50,

17
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:11,590
60 years ago when screenwriters were
under contract to studios and they were

18
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:13,110
turning out three,
four,

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,120
five screenplays a year
and directors redirecting a two and

20
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:19,690
three,
four films a year.

21
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,040
Michael Critias,
who directed Casa Blanca by the time he

22
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,680
died,
had directed a hundred and 20 films.

23
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,050
Well,
those days are gone.

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,710
If a director gets to direct 12 films in
his lifetime,

25
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:35,170
you'd be a success,
and so you can't,

26
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,000
you can't trace development and who's
doing the cutting edge thing or whatever

27
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:43,240
like that.
I'm in it quite in those,

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,170
in those ways.
I think the three guys who write produce

29
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,480
and often direct damages,
uh,

30
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:50,981
uh,
the,

31
00:01:50,981 --> 00:01:53,380
the two brothers,
allman brothers and Kessler,

32
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,880
those three guys are,
as doing as exciting,

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,460
uh,
uh,

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,890
work as writers,
as anybody in film.

35
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,620
Film is a very,
would film,

36
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,270
is very conservative.
They do not take risks.

37
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,190
Television is experimental.
I mean watching the Sopranos,

38
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:18,670
whatever you and we're six feet under,
it was,

39
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,480
it was,
uh,

40
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,650
an example of applying to television,
the principle of the novel known as the

41
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:24,820
unreliable narrator.

42
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,450
You can never be sure when you're
watching the sopranos and six feet

43
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:29,800
under,
is this a dream sequence?

44
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,400
Is Somebody hallucinating?
This just actually happened or they just

45
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,170
having fun with us.
There's whatever.

46
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,810
I mean,
until you saw enough of the episode,

47
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,000
realize that the whole damned episode
was a dream.

48
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,450
Nobody does that film.
You can't do that in the movies.

49
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,480
You know,
it,

50
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:51,940
it costs 30 slash 5,000 million dollars
to make a film.

51
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,760
You can't have,
you can't have that kind of an

52
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:57,100
experimentation.
And when it comes along,

53
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,890
it went.
When such experiments happen,

54
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:00,724
like,
um,

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,150
uh,
the usual suspects when somebody pulls

56
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,900
the plug at the end and you realize
Kevin Spacey made the whole damn thing

57
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:08,920
up.
It's,

58
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,870
it's,
it's,

59
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:11,080
um,
uh,

60
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,290
a big,
uh,

61
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,740
it's a form of cheap surprise.
It's a big,

62
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,030
huge,
cheap surprise.

63
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,920
It's not as if it was being done like
Louis Barnwell would have done in the

64
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:28,921
sixties to really express the absurdity
of life when,

65
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,650
when,
when film does tricky storytelling,

66
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:35,040
things like that on occasion,
um,

67
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,980
it's,
it's not as if it's driven by a theme.

68
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,590
It's,
um,

69
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,960
you know,
the,

70
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,960
the six ads for example,
and the mind fuck ending is just cheap

71
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:51,721
surprise is what film students do,
but it's not as if that filmmaker has a

72
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:56,821
deep philosophical understanding,
a that runs against the grain of,

73
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,620
of,
of contemporary,

74
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,950
a sense of reality.
I mean,

75
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:07,951
he's not,
he's just having fun and I'm so he just

76
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:12,590
does this film school thing,
the mind fuck or whatever.

77
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,540
Uh,
so and so film is very conservative in

78
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,380
that way.
You can't,

79
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,140
can't experiment like that or if it's an
independent film,

80
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:27,400
you could do films like Pie,
no Aronofsky film,

81
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,690
right?
Which is extremely experimental for the

82
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:36,430
sake of experimental.
And these guys all went to film school

83
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,150
and,
um,

84
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,650
they were taught barnwell and truffaut
and um,

85
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,250
and the wash and uh,
and uh,

86
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,330
uh,
Bergman and they went,

87
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,330
they were taught the classics of the
Avant Garde.

88
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:54,510
And so they imitate what used to be
really dangerous stuff in the sixties.

89
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,100
Um,
and it's,

90
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:57,940
uh,
today,

91
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,310
uh,
there's no,

92
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:01,150
um,
there's no,

93
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,880
uh,
avant garde today.

94
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,800
It's a retro God.
Today we have people going back to

95
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,360
imitating,
um,

96
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,360
uh,
eccentric forms of the past,

97
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,600
um,
because they went to film school and

98
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:18,610
they think they should do that and that
makes them an artist.

99
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,280
And so I,
I would say that as a storytelling

100
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:24,220
medium film in particular has had a dead
end.

101
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,520
There's,
it's,

102
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,240
as I said,
it's very expensive.

103
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:31,480
It's very conservative and
experimentation is,

104
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:32,500
um,
is there,

105
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,950
uh,
to have more show off than meaningful

106
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,940
gimmickry.
Um,

107
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:39,843
it's,
um,

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
it's something.
Something's got to give on what the hell

109
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:50,110
that will be a in order for film to
revive itself as an art form,

110
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,360
as a form of entertainment in the form
of commerce,

111
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,590
uh,
films doing than ever.

112
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,660
Oh,
that's such an,

113
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,800
um,
you know,

114
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:08,801
generally unhappy topic
I've sold or optioned or been our role

115
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,650
written for hire a 12 screenplays in
Hollywood.

116
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,490
Uh,
one of them I have option to four times

117
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:22,040
over.
And as far as,

118
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:22,820
uh,
uh,

119
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,350
all of my screenplays are concerned.
Um,

120
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,200
none of them ever get produced a,
they have all floundered for various

121
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:35,201
reasons to no less than three times.
I've had studios change administrations

122
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:37,310
in the middle of the development of
mine.

123
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,760
Um,
and so,

124
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,880
you know,
when a new a new presidents come in,

125
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,640
they throw out everything that's in
development from the previous

126
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:45,740
administration and the egos.
I mean,

127
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:50,090
so one of those sad,
I'm a development hell stories,

128
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,630
uh,
where you know,

129
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,670
you,
you make money.

130
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,733
I mean,
I make,

131
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,610
I made a lot of money,
uh,

132
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,070
but you don't see it on the screen.
On the other hand,

133
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,360
everything I've written for television
gets made and shoveled a lot of episodic

134
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:03,194
cop shows.

135
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,350
I watched the pilot for the Turner Bible
mini series.

136
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:10,610
I wrote to Abraham with the director by
Joseph Sergeant,

137
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:13,310
who's a wonderful Emmy award winning
director.

138
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,870
It started Richard Harrison,
Barbara Hershey and Maximilian Shell.

139
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,740
It was,
you know,

140
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,760
find production.
And so when you write,

141
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,780
when I've written for TV,
they get made and uh,

142
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,300
and they hold up there,
it's good writing.

143
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,010
Um,
but uh,

144
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:33,011
screenplays a is the guild wants,
did a study of how many of all these

145
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:40,070
screenplays that get optioned a how many
actually see it to the screen.

146
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,170
A four out of every 20 scripts for which
serious money is paid,

147
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,350
one gets made.
So the age of 20 to one.

148
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,640
So I've,
you know,

149
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,610
I've only right now it's only 12 to one
for me.

150
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:53,660
So,
so,

151
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,550
you know,
um,

152
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,610
but that's,
that's neither here nor there.

153
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,800
I mean,
that's just the way it is.

154
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,010
And uh,
uh,

155
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,140
just bad luck.

156
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:08,330
But in the meantime,
while I was going through that period,

157
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,120
um,
I started to teach a writing about

158
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:16,121
writing and writing about writing
many of them every time one of my

159
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,760
writers wins an Oscar,
a booker prize,

160
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,540
Apulia surprise and Emmy and whatever.
I mean,

161
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,730
when,
when or they call me and um,

162
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,840
and they,
they tell me that,

163
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,090
that they,
that they,

164
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,080
they got something published that was
unpublishable and then they came to my

165
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:41,390
class,
did a rewrite and now it's,

166
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,400
you know,
it's in the world whether they win

167
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:45,080
awards or not.
But when,

168
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:47,690
um,
when people take what I teach them,

169
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:53,180
think it through it all I try to do.
I cannot teach people how to write.

170
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,650
Nobody can teach how to do anything like
that.

171
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,010
I just give them things to think about.
I just want them to think the,

172
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,950
I am categorically opposed to what I
call the Vesuvius School of writing

173
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,270
where it's all magma,
that the writer just sits there and it

174
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:13,800
just explodes out of them.

175
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,310
And it's sort of like automatic writing
and they just know.

176
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,280
They just,
um,

177
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,770
there are subconscious mind just
whatever that,

178
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,060
that this ridiculous way of teaching
creative writing that there's no craft,

179
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,580
that there's no thought,
that there's no rewriting,

180
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:29,010
that there's no understanding by the
writer that it's all,

181
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,930
some sort of innocent,
spontaneous that is such idiocy.

182
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,520
Um,
and so,

183
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:37,320
um,
I can't teach people how to write,

184
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,560
but if I can give them things to think
about things to consider,

185
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,480
uh,
elements of craft and um,

186
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,590
and um,
and,

187
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,700
and,
and the process so that their work

188
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:55,701
improves and talented people think about
what they're doing at some point in a

189
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:59,970
way that is very useful to them as a
result of that.

190
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:03,750
I put the idea in their head that these
are things that can be thought about.

191
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,700
And,
uh,

192
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,720
and here's a way to think about it,
doesn't give you the answers.

193
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:13,650
It just raises the right questions.
If I can get writers to ask the right

194
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:18,651
questions of their own work and
financers based upon insights that

195
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:20,910
they've gained from my writing,
my lecturing,

196
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,250
then,
uh,

197
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,690
my,
my day is made.

198
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,990
Yeah.
