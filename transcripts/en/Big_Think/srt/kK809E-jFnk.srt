1
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:12,110
I think it's funny in that there's
definitely a huge difference between how

2
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:17,111
you just explained design in from a
market perspective and how you would

3
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:22,121
explain design as the curator at Moma in
my world.

4
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,380
Design really is about beauty.
It's about

5
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,210
how does this work fit in with my
collection?

6
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,250
How does this look next to everything
else in my collection?

7
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:41,570
It really has nothing to do with the old
form versus function debate.

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,840
Um,
ornament can still be crime in the,

9
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:47,960
in the,
in the contemporary design movement.

10
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:51,920
But the work itself is frequently an
ornament.

11
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,250
It's not about a work having ornament
applied to it.

12
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:58,370
It's about the work itself,
mimicking sculpture,

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,290
mimicking contemporary art,
and that is the fundamental basis of

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,320
contemporary design in the market world.
On the other side of the coin,

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,280
if I was to become a full on curator at
an institution,

16
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:17,270
I would be far more concerned with good
design that question,

17
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:19,040
what is good design and,
and,

18
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:24,090
and form and function.
And thus one of my heroes,

19
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:29,111
one of my personal heroes over the last
20 years in terms of who is the most

20
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:32,660
innovative,
smartest designer of our times,

21
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:37,870
to which I would say Jasper Morrison,
Morrison is not much of a presence in

22
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,740
the market because everything he does is
so minimalist and so oriented towards

23
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,890
function.
Making this piece work.

24
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,750
You steps.
