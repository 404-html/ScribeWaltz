1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,950
No one knows all the answers,
but I'll.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,250
I'll mention two of them.
Let me say two words.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,400
Television News,
television news.

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,120
Fifty years ago when television news was
young,

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,420
the philosophy television news is
basically just broadcast news on

6
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:25,310
television.
It was reporters on television,

7
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:26,600
somebody trying to say what had
happened.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,930
That was what they did.
You might have 30 minutes of news

9
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:32,780
without a single televised clip of
anything.

10
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:36,320
Just somebody that's sitting there
reading the news sometimes at great

11
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:37,810
length,
that was television news.

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,080
It was simply an effort to inform
nowadays never to entertain and to play

13
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:44,690
to the gallery.
It matters if there are pictures of

14
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:46,210
matters.
If their jokes you can tell matters,

15
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,810
we'd get.
People want to yell and scream at each

16
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:48,644
other.

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,780
That's really taken us down a sad path
everyone says,

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,510
but I think it's true.
That's emphasized the notion that the

19
00:00:56,511 --> 00:00:59,660
right way to have interaction is to get
very strong advocates who will call each

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,420
other names.
One thing that's striking about the way

21
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:05,090
the news is today,
take an issue,

22
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:06,530
a contested issue,
abortion,

23
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:10,090
the war,
whatever you like news today is virgo to

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,750
telling us people's positions on these
issues.

25
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:14,540
Candidates say it's very bad at telling
us why they have their positions.

26
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,530
Uh,
it strikes me that one of the jobs of

27
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:20,480
were news reporters,
not to say so and so is for or against

28
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,220
abortion rights,
but what so and so's argument,

29
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,250
why does so and so I believe that I,
years ago I ran into a guy who was

30
00:01:27,831 --> 00:01:32,831
retired reporter for a major newspaper
and he was lamenting what had happened

31
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:37,160
to the news and he was telling me how
when he was coming along in the sixties,

32
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,250
if the president announced the New Urban
Affairs Initiative,

33
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,510
the headline would be the next day
President Announces Urban Affairs

34
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:44,510
Initiative.

35
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,090
And the story would be explaining what
it was.

36
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,060
This is what the president proposed.
That's the story today.

37
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:51,440
He said,
and we had this meeting in the nineties

38
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:55,130
today.
He said the story would be Republicans

39
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,190
Attack Presidents Urban Affairs
Initiative as the first paragraph is a

40
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,540
brief token.
Summer was having the secretary or

41
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,290
somebody attacking it third grade
because somebody at defending it,

42
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,480
you never take much time to explain what
it is.

43
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:11,360
The important thing is who's gonna win?
Who's gonna lose,

44
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,120
who's on which side.
That's one thing.

45
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:16,340
Certainly that's to help take us down,
but that's not the only thing.

46
00:02:16,341 --> 00:02:18,260
One theory is the big problem.
Luxury.

47
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,790
We've been a generation here.
I speak of myself and the other baby

48
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,760
boomers whose had everything we don't
feel as though we've ever.

49
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:28,520
They were constantly complaining.
Everything's going wrong in our lives,

50
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,890
but there's a sense which compared to
the rest of world we've had everything

51
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:33,210
we've everything we could want.
Um,

52
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,740
and that's given us a lot of time to
ruminate,

53
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,160
a maybe too much time to read what I
think our luxury has made us in cautious

54
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,530
in how we use democracy.
