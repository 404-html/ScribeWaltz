1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,983
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,190
let me,
let me give you an example and I don't

3
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:14,620
really have the numbers memorized,
but you can get the gist.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,030
There is an example of pretty common
example that's used that you have a

5
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:22,960
sister that's 22 twin sisters and
they're both 25 years old.

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,410
One sister at 25 saved $2,000 a year for
10 years until she's 35.

7
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,390
Okay.
And then she stops at 35 and she just

8
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:36,391
lets that $20,000 grow until she's 65.
Meanwhile her twin sister did not save

9
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:43,000
that whole 10 years.
She starts when she's 35 years old at

10
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:48,001
the time when her other sister quit
saving and she saves $2,000 a year for

11
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:52,630
the next 30 years until she's 65 years
old,

12
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:57,990
which she saved a total of $60,000.
Do you know who ends up with more money?

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,680
Sr One who only saved $20,000 compared
to her sister who saved for 30 years a

14
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,670
total of $60,000 and fact sr one who
again only say for 10 years almost has

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,080
double the amount of money of the second
sister who saved more but waited longer.

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,100
You know,
waited 10 years before she started

17
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:23,920
saving.
That is the power of compound growth.
