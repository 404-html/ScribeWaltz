1
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,960
You don't have to believe in it.
There's no dogma,

2
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:10,160
you know,
even like I said,

3
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:14,570
it uses iconography and symbolism from,
you know,

4
00:00:14,571 --> 00:00:17,240
things like gnostic Christianity and
Esoteric Judaism,

5
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:19,730
things like that,
but it doesn't require you to believe in

6
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:22,580
these things.
The reason that uses a symbolism is,

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,511
you know,
for example,

8
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:25,220
in the part of the country that I grew
up in,

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,150
there are literally places where you
come to a four way stop and there are

10
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:33,080
churches on all four corners,
so even if you're completely atheist,

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,570
even if you're repelled by these things,
they are still part of your psyche still

12
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,100
part of our,
our culture.

13
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:44,270
So we on some level respond to those
things in some way.

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,660
That doesn't mean we necessarily have to
believe in them for Magic to work.

15
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,441
You know,
like I said,

16
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:52,550
the people who devise these techniques
wanted to know what works,

17
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:53,990
why it works,
how it works,

18
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:55,250
and how we can make it work better.

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,060
You don't have to believe in any of this
any more than you have to believe that

20
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:01,220
your muscles are going to get bigger by
going to the gym.

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,590
I'll hear a lot of people say,
you know,

22
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:05,870
I don't believe in magic,
and I'll think,

23
00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:09,440
well actually what you mean is you've
never tried magic because it doesn't

24
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:12,080
require belief.
If you hadn't actually tried these

25
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:12,860
things,
you know,

26
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,100
invested time and energy into attempting
to do them,

27
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:18,110
you would see that they actually did
work.

28
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,530
That it's not a a process of belief.
The way that.

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,330
I guess one of the things that was so
hard about eastern traditions like zen

30
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,070
was you focus almost entirely on staying
in the present moment all the time.

31
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,630
You know,
that is really,

32
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,240
really hard once you actually start
trying to do that.

33
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:37,670
You realize how out of control your
thoughts are.

34
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,230
You know,
our thoughts chase themselves around

35
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:43,310
like a dog chasing its own tail all the
time from the time we get up until the

36
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:48,311
time we go to sleep and a lot of the
eastern traditions deal with almost

37
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:50,840
wrestling against that.
You know,

38
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:53,900
every time you realize you're doing it,
bringing yourself back to the present

39
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:56,240
moment,
back to the present moment over and over

40
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,430
and over.
For me,

41
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,400
I didn't get a lot of results out of
that,

42
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,100
you know,
I never found myself in the present

43
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:08,150
moment more than I was whenever I
started the practices ceremonial magic.

44
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:10,400
On the other hand,
what it does is it doesn't really

45
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:13,520
address that at all.
Instead you're dealing like for example,

46
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:17,390
on energy circulation practices where
you're circulating ci through different

47
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:21,260
parts of your body.
You're trying to energize different

48
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:23,420
energy centers that run down through
your spine.

49
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,880
Doing that as a side effect.
You become more and more present and I

50
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:31,970
didn't even realize you know the.
A lot of these practices say for

51
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:33,500
example,
the lesser banishing ritual of the

52
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:35,510
Pentagram.
When you would learn these things,

53
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:39,680
traditionally the organization,
the order would give you these exercises

54
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:41,270
and they would not tell you what they're
going to do.

55
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:42,650
They would not tell you what they're
for.

56
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:44,690
They would say,
go practice this for a year.

57
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,720
Come back and talk to us then,
and if you're interested in learning

58
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:49,670
more and going forward,
we'll talk about it.

59
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:52,280
Then whenever you came back they would
say,

60
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:54,650
okay,
well what did you experience?

61
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,650
That's how they would know if you had
actually been practicing them or not.

62
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,060
So I would these techniques,
the middle pillar,

63
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:02,740
the lesser banishing ritual of the
Pentagram.

64
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,460
And one day while I was in prison,
I bent over to tie my shoes and I

65
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:15,971
realized without even trying to do so,
I was in the present moment and it was

66
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,440
almost like an atomic bomb going off
because it was for the very first time

67
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,950
in my life I realized,
Oh my God,

68
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,660
I'm completely in the present moment.

69
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,940
Of course,
the second you think that it shattered

70
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,280
and you know,
you're back to thinking or whatever.

71
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:33,860
But it was even after years of zen
practice,

72
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,210
it was the first time that I truly
experienced that and it was due to

73
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:42,080
ceremonial magic.
So one of the techniques that I use,

74
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,920
uh,
you know,

75
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,100
the analogy I used earlier about
flushing yourself out like a cup of

76
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:49,370
water.
This is a technique that flushes our

77
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:50,240
thoughts out.
You know,

78
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:53,300
if you have a song going through your
head over and over,

79
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:56,690
or if you're reliving an argument you
had with someone a year ago,

80
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,920
if you're obsessed over something that
you can't get out of your head,

81
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:06,070
this technique is good for that as well
as just general meditation purposes.

82
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,770
It doesn't have a name.
I usually just refer to it as the prison

83
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:12,020
cell meditation.
Um,

84
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,830
but if you're interested,
I'll do that.

85
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,560
Is that okay?
All right.

86
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,680
You start by closing your eyes
and then you envision yourself in a

87
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:25,290
prison sale.
Standing in the center of a sale.

88
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,770
Everything is white.
The walls are white,

89
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,220
ceiling is white.
The floors are white.

90
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,760
The only thing there is in the sale
other than you on the back wall is a

91
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:43,761
slit of a window and it's up so high
that the only way that you can reach it,

92
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,390
the only way you can see out of it is by
gripping the window ledge,

93
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:53,391
high above your head and hoisting
yourself up by sheer brute physical,

94
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,570
upper body strength.
Almost like you're doing a pull up or a

95
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:01,050
chin up.
So you want to bring as much tactile

96
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,960
sensation to the visualization as you
possibly can.

97
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,990
You want to feel it as much as you can.
So picture yourself walking to the back

98
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:12,180
of this wall,
pressing yourself against it,

99
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,250
reaching up with your hands and gripping
the edge of that window.

100
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,250
Seal with your fingertips.
Try to feel what the back wall of that

101
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:25,590
prison cell would feel like pressed
against the side of your face,

102
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,570
pressed against your torso.
Feel the coldness of it,

103
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,760
the grittiness of it,
and as you start to lift yourself up off

104
00:05:35,761 --> 00:05:40,230
the floor using gesture arms,
try to feel what that would actually

105
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:42,720
feel like.
Feel the muscles in your shoulders.

106
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,110
Feel the muscles in your chest and your
abdomen firing,

107
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,780
tensing.
As you're pulling yourself up,

108
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,460
try to feel what the wall would feel
like as you scrape against it.

109
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,940
Lifting yourself slowly by shear
strength

110
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,060
as your eyes crest over the rim of the
window,

111
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,620
white light burst through the window,
floods through the window,

112
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,780
and obliterates everything.
The sale you everything until there's

113
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:19,631
only white light remaining.
Do it again.

114
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,820
Press yourself against the back of the
wall.

115
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,960
Reach out with both hands and gripped
the edge of the window sill.

116
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,560
Feel the muscles in your chest and your
abdomen and your shoulders tensing.

117
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,310
As you start to lift yourself up,
feel the wall scrape against the front

118
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:41,890
of your thighs against the side of your
face.

119
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,420
As you hoist yourself,
until your eyes go over the edge of the

120
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:51,130
window frame and then white light comes
flooding in through the window,

121
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,550
obliterating everything you the sale
until there's only white light.

122
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,580
Once more,
feel yourself pressed against the wall.

123
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,260
Raise your arms,
Hook your fingertips over the window

124
00:07:11,261 --> 00:07:15,880
ledge.
Begin to raise yourself slowly up by

125
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:20,470
sheer strength,
feeling the muscles in your shoulders,

126
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,470
your chest,
your torso,

127
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:29,730
straining as you lift your body weight.
Feel the wall of the prison sale as you

128
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,620
scrub against it,
and as your eyes go over the edge of the

129
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:40,770
window frame,
white light comes flooding in,

130
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,550
obliterating everything,
and this is one of those things you can

131
00:07:47,381 --> 00:07:50,650
do for as long as you have time.
You can do it five times,

132
00:07:50,651 --> 00:07:52,720
you can do it 10 times.
The longer you do it,

133
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,560
the more effective it is.
And it gives you something to work with,

134
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,570
you know,
in your visualization,

135
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,270
instead of just trying to stay in the
present moment,

136
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,500
which is really,
really hard.
