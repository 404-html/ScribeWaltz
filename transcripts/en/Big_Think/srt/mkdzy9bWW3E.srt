00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,370
There's been some fascinating research
to suggest that when we play games and

2
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:10,681
we tap into positive emotions like
curiosity and optimism and creativity,

3
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:13,840
and,
and even love that these emotions

4
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:17,980
actually stayed with us for up to 24
hours after we finished playing the

5
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:20,740
game.
So studies have shown that we're more

6
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:25,741
likely to cooperate with someone in our
real lives after we played a social game

7
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:27,730
with them,
where we're doing some kind of

8
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:32,731
cooperative mission over more likely to
set an ambitious goal for ourselves.

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,590
After we've succeeded in a game,
we'll,

10
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:39,100
we'll speak up more for ourselves.
We'll even flirt with more attractive

11
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:42,640
strangers.
So there's this kind of transfer of our

12
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:44,890
confidence,
of our creativity,

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,100
of our,
of our ambition to our real lives.

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,000
We have this idea that playing games is
kind of a waste of time,

15
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,420
um,
that it's not a very productive way to

16
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:56,620
spend our time.

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,300
And I kept hearing that even as I was
evangelizing all of the benefits of

18
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:03,490
gaming,
the emotional benefits of social,

19
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:06,130
the psychological benefits people kept
saying,

20
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:06,880
yeah,
but it's,

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,910
it's just a waste of time.
Shouldn't we be doing something more

22
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:11,530
productive than,
you know,

23
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,760
avenging some angry birds.
And it really made me wonder,

24
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:18,130
well,
what do we mean by productive?

25
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,680
I mean,
productivity is about producing

26
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,950
something.
What do we really want to produce more

27
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:26,920
of in our lives and in the lives of the
people around us?

28
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:29,350
You know,
are we trying to produce more emails or,

29
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,350
you know,
are we trying to produce more positive

30
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:34,900
emotion?
Are we trying to produce stronger

31
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:38,170
relationships?
Are we trying to produce a sense of

32
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:41,650
meaning and purpose?
And it turns out that Games are actually

33
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:45,520
quite good at producing those things.
That's what they produce more of and

34
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:49,930
better than almost anything else.
So when people say Games are a waste of

35
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:53,650
time and not productive,
I would challenge them to ask

36
00:01:53,651 --> 00:01:55,660
themselves,
what do you want to produce more of?

37
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,400
And if it's things like better
relationships and more positive emotion

38
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:03,730
in my daily life than games might be the
most productive thing you can do.
