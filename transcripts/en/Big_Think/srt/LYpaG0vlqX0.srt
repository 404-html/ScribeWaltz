1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,510
Peter,
Jay Peterson.

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,360
Originally,
I was brought up in the middle of

3
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:14,361
Nebraska in a small rural town,
1,733 miles to Boston and 1733 to sam

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,800
go.
Um,

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,840
very profoundly.
My parents were Greek immigrants.

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,800
They came here without a pen,
a without a word of English and a third

7
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:34,950
grade education.
And they moved out to men,

8
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:38,250
Nebraska because that's where their
relatives,

9
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:43,251
where my father took a job.
No one else would take washing dishes

10
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:48,090
and the caboose of a Union Pacific
railroad that was being built.

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,580
It was steaming hot there,
which I guess the reason no one wanted

12
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:58,581
to take the job and he ate on the
caboose and slept on the caboose and

13
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:03,621
saved a virtually everything he made,
which he turned into the inevitable

14
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:11,340
Greek restaurant 24 hours a day,
seven days a week for 25 years.

15
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:15,720
That never closed.
And he was there all too many of those

16
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:17,370
hours,
weeks and uh,

17
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,050
and years.

18
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,530
I didn't say I'm a great as much as I'd
like because he'd leave by six in the

19
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:27,630
morning and he'd come home about nine
o'clock at night,

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,960
pretty much exhausted.
So my brother and myself could spend a

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,990
few minutes with him then usually,
uh,

22
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,100
providing some hot water and salt for
his legs that were swollen with varicose

23
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:49,000
veins.
But he was a great model of,

24
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,790
uh,
working,

25
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,360
achieving,
and saving for the future.

26
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,260
He believed deeply in America.
He believed deeply in the American dream

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,630
and we seem to have forgotten as the
American dream is all about your,

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,440
your children doing better than you do.
And one of the reasons he saved was

29
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:10,670
that,
uh,

30
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,020
he wanted,
as he put it

31
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,520
to bias,
the best education money could buy.

32
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,180
And indeed he did.
So I learned a great deal from him about

33
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:26,310
focusing on the future,
focusing on your goals,

34
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,620
uh,
saving

35
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,050
and investing.

36
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,510
My mother was also a Greek immigrant.
She spent most of her time cooking and

37
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,480
making all the clothes we wore,
which at times got pretty embarrassing.

38
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,070
She did everything.
She washed iron scrubbed,

39
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,930
mowed the lawn.
Uh,

40
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,720
if there's anything she didn't do around
the house,

41
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:59,721
I don't know that during World War Two,
when they build an air force base near

42
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:05,911
the small town,
the business exploded in size and she

43
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:08,770
worked many,
many hours there too.

44
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,920
But for much of her life,
she was the typical American homemaker

45
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,120
I'd say.
And we saw infinitely more her than we

46
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:19,661
did.
You know,

47
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:20,494
him.

48
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,540
The first born son,
psychologically,

49
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,660
as we all know,
has certain advantages and certain

50
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:30,660
problems.
Um,

51
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,160
in my case,
I was treated like a prince and I,

52
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,600
uh,
had the great advantage during the first

53
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,120
three years or so of,
uh,

54
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,080
probably they're developing a pretty
healthy sense of self esteem and

55
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:52,870
affection.
We ran into a tragedy.

56
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:55,690
However,
when I was four,

57
00:03:55,691 --> 00:04:00,691
my one year old sister died suddenly
from croup form of pneumonia,

58
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:08,530
I guess.
And she was my mother's

59
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,680
attempt to be born again,
you might say through her daughter

60
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,560
because he's great wives,
live very tough lives giving how their

61
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,800
husbands were working and when she lost
her beloved daughter,

62
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:32,290
she went into very deep mourning.
And I,

63
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,920
uh,
as a child who normally

64
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,090
thinks we,
I think we think of ourselves as the

65
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:43,930
center of the solar system.
Everything revolves around us.

66
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,390
We're responsible for everything.

67
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,630
I guess I wondered why as my mother
withdrew and to the deepest,

68
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:57,271
deepest depression psychologically what
I did to cause her to abandon me,

69
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,290
added to my complexities,
I guess you'd say.

70
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,330
I formed a,
uh,

71
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,890
a pattern of having to achieve and
having to be perfect so I could somehow

72
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:16,690
regain her,
uh,

73
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:22,230
her affection and her intention and
that's had some good points and just had

74
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:28,771
some bad points because trying to
achieve perfection can be a productive,

75
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:33,760
that can also be a very destructive
process after a while.

76
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,960
So she had quite an impact on me
while I was pretty dumb about

77
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,210
recognizing whatever talents I do have.
George Ball,

78
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:53,410
the grade under secretary of state,
and one of my partners at Lehman used to

79
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:58,411
refer to me as relentlessly analytical.
I'm pretty good at analyzing problems,

80
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,480
getting the facts,
raising the right questions and uh,

81
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,860
and so forth.
I'm also a peculiar combination

82
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,630
of a total mechanical Klutz in the sense
that I'm incapable of operating in the

83
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:23,651
most simple machine or fixing it.
But I've always been rather creative on

84
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,820
asking questions that is inventing the
questions.

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,270
So I went through some job changes early
on,

86
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:40,271
which reflected a certain,
almost invincible ignorance of my

87
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,530
qualities.
I did my graduate work at University of

88
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,720
Chicago on Adam Smith taught us about
comparative advantage and how you ought

89
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:55,721
to focus on your comparative advantage.
So for reasons that aren't clear at all

90
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:01,940
to me,
I went into retailing

91
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,840
yeah.

92
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,340
And uh,
was assistant manager of a toy

93
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:11,890
department at Christmas,
if you can believe that.

94
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,743
And

95
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,370
if,
if that experience played to my

96
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,370
comparative advantage,
I can't imagine what they were.

97
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:25,490
So I quickly got out of that business
and got into the market research and

98
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:31,161
analysis business was where I belonged.
And later on into the advertising

99
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:37,230
business where I could combine whatever
analytical ability I had

100
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:42,600
with working with a creative people,
by asking them questions and suggesting

101
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:46,390
problems that need to be solved without
knowing how to sell them.

102
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,500
So I think my talents are somewhere
along the line of analyzing things and

103
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:56,751
having a certain sense maybe of where
the world is going and being reasonably

104
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:02,811
creative and asking the questions that
sometimes lead to creative answers.

105
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,840
Well,
I'm a huge believer in dumb luck.

106
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,930
I think Donald Look beats a smart
planning much more often than we would

107
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,720
like to admit.
Uh,

108
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,200
people have,
uh,

109
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,660
incorrectly praised my quite varied
career,

110
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,550
including government service and public
service.

111
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,020
And I like to explain and how I got into
going to Washington and President

112
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:39,410
Nixon's White House and later to his
cabinet,

113
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:45,170
I was working at 39 self of cell in
Chicago.

114
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,343
MMM.

115
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,580
I used to walk to the railroad stations
a lot cheaper.

116
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:57,330
And um,
I one day I noticed at 19 south of cell

117
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:00,060
there was universe Chicago graduate
school.

118
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,540
Well,
I been planning to go to northwestern

119
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:07,140
where I'd done my undergraduate work,
but it was all the way across Chicago

120
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,940
and since it was night school,
it would have taken me 20,

121
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:14,970
30 minutes to get over there in 20,
30 minutes to get back.

122
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,620
So I said,
well,

123
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,850
you know,
maybe I had to go to the University of

124
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,870
Chicago.
It's supposed to be a pretty good place.

125
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,650
So that's why I went to the universe.
Chicago.

126
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:28,050
It has nothing to do with career
planning or anything of the sort.

127
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,960
It was there that I made some of the
best friends I have on the faculty.

128
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,450
Uh,
Milton Friedman,

129
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,970
George Stiegler,
George Shultz,

130
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,050
and George later you'll recall,
became a very senior figure in the Nixon

131
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:50,010
administration.
He became secretary of Labor,

132
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,460
uh,
office of Management and Budget

133
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,610
Secretary to Treasury.
And then later in the Reagan

134
00:09:56,611 --> 00:10:00,810
administration,
Secretary of State and George and I had

135
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:03,240
worked very close together,
University of Chicago.

136
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,380
And I had taught there for about four or
five years,

137
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,940
part time at night.

138
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,040
Okay.

139
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,130
So one day he called me and said that
President Nixon wants to see it

140
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:18,760
tomorrow.
So I go to Washington.

141
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:23,761
I ended up in the Oval Office and uh,
the president pointed out to me that,

142
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,830
uh,
he thought economics was going to become

143
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
terribly important at the vortex and
foreign policy and that,

144
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:37,354
uh,

145
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,390
yeah,

146
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,230
he and Henry Kissinger,
my good friend had a very complicated

147
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,520
relationship.
For some reason he felt need to tell me

148
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:51,660
that Henry didn't know a damn thing
about economics and uh,

149
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,540
what was worse?
He didn't know what he didn't know.

150
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,600
So he went on to set up a new council
counterpart of the National Security

151
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,170
Council and I was to head it,
well,

152
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:09,171
this isn't a anything I had planned or
anything and I've looked back on that.

153
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:14,211
I've been immensely grateful for my
public service opportunity,

154
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,800
some of the most exciting experiences
broadening I'd ever had.

155
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:25,140
It has led to my being involved with
some great nonprofit organizations.

156
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:31,010
I just stepped down after 22 years as
chairman of the council on Foreign

157
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,860
Relations.
I'm the founding chairman of the so

158
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,980
called Peterson Institute for
International Economics,

159
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,100
one of the founders of the concord
coalition.

160
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:47,010
And I doubt very much I would have done
those things if I hadn't gone to

161
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:47,850
Washington.

162
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,900
And I thought I'd go into Washington if
I hadn't have,

163
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:57,830
didn't happen to have an office at 39 as
long as southwest cell in Chicago didn't

164
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,990
happen to have a downtown school at 19
southwest cell.

165
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,790
So never,
never

166
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,550
underestimate
the role of luck in life.

167
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,950
And I think the trick,
I've forgotten who the councilman was

168
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:19,240
and uh,
in New York who once said,

169
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:23,140
I seen my opportunities and I took them.
Um,

170
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:29,010
I think it's important when you do have
something that luck thrust upon you to

171
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:34,840
somehow be made in such a way
psychologically.

172
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:39,841
That is Paul Tillich said once,
if you're comfortable with ambiguity,

173
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,090
that's,
that's what you need when you're in a

174
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:48,091
rapidly changing world.
So I say dumb luck and taken advantage

175
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:53,251
of your opportunities will often lead to
more instinct places then a longterm

176
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,710
smart career planning.

177
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,210
Sure.
I do a lot of traveling around the world

178
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:06,160
and I,
and government,

179
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:11,161
I got to know other governments as well.
That's a remarkable country with regard

180
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:15,470
to its absence of barriers.
Uh,

181
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,070
is resilience.
It's responsiveness.

182
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,430
Just think of it.
Uh,

183
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:26,410
when my father started his restaurant in
the 1920s,

184
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,790
the restaurant was petitioned by the Ku
Klux Klan saying,

185
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:38,500
don't eat with the Greek.
There were no blacks there.

186
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:42,760
So I guess they figured the grapes where
the next most desirable,

187
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,950
um,
target.

188
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:50,010
We go from a situation like that
to where if anybody's been prejudiced

189
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:55,540
against me because I was a great guy,
been unaware of it.

190
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,813
MMM.

191
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:03,550
I worked in the 1960s with,
uh,

192
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,540
when I was CEO of a company called Bell
and Howell with Martin Luther King.

193
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:14,590
And I went through the tragic
division and racism of the,

194
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,420
of the 60s where blacks were formerly
and most often informally blocked from

195
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:28,190
all kinds of participation in American
life,

196
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,420
business,
social,

197
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,580
political.
I looked today to Barack Obama and,

198
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:35,414
uh,

199
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,110
okay,

200
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,120
uh,
I think it's quite possible today,

201
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,190
let a black could be elected president,
the United States.

202
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,040
And that's taken place in a remarkably
short period of time.

203
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:56,050
So this is a country with limitless
frontiers and very few barriers.

204
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,250
And if you work hard and study hard and
you've got good luck,

205
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,960
you can do very well in this country.
