1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,090
Well,
about two years ago,

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,160
I stumbled on a piece of neuroscience
that just stunned me,

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,970
uh,
as a psychologist,

4
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,950
I wish somebody had told me more about
this,

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,160
but um,
what I learned is that there appears to

6
00:00:18,161 --> 00:00:20,920
be a part of our brain called the
ventral striatum.

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,580
That's the technical term,
or you also could call it the seeking

8
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:29,581
system.
And this system is urging us to explore

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,570
the boundaries of what we know.
It's urging us to be curious.

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,670
And by the way,
I mean innately,

11
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,150
I mean children's six months old,
three months old,

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,290
if you give them some toy,
they love it for a little while is they

13
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:47,560
get used to it.
Your car keys become more interesting.

14
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,490
It's the new and it's the desire to
learn.

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,220
And evolutionarily this system was
developed to help us to keep us

16
00:00:57,221 --> 00:00:59,860
learning.
And so when I learned about this seeking

17
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:02,800
system,
it really turned me on because it

18
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:07,801
started to give me an insight into why
disengagement from boring work.

19
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,910
That may not be a bug.
That might be a feature on the 2015,

20
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,690
2016 Gallup polls.
The evidence is that about 70 percent of

21
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:21,691
people are not engaged in what they do
all day long and about 18 percent of

22
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:26,020
people aren't repulsed.
The actively disengaged from what they

23
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:30,250
do and I think that the reason why I say
this is a problem and it could even be

24
00:01:30,251 --> 00:01:35,251
called an epidemic is because work is
mostly what we do.

25
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,570
You know,
we spend so much more time at work than

26
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:41,740
with our families and then those things
called hobbies and so I think that the

27
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:45,480
pervasiveness of people feeling like
workers,

28
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:50,550
a thing that we have to shut off from a
thing that we can't be our best selves,

29
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,870
a thing that we have to get through on
the way to the weekend.

30
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:01,050
I think that that is a sort of
humanistic sickness and while it is bad

31
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:03,940
for people,
that's the humanistic bit.

32
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,110
It also is really bad for organizations
who get lackluster performance.

33
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,680
I think that it's interesting to think
about when this all started happening

34
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,860
and you know I didn't live back in the
18 fifties,

35
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:19,861
but all the records suggest that you
could buy shoes and those shoes would be

36
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:22,990
sold by some store,
some cobbler,

37
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,150
and maybe there'll be three people that
work there.

38
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,770
Rarely would there be five people that
work there and while that probably

39
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:33,130
wasn't the best work in the world,
each of the people in the store would

40
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:37,630
watch the customer walk in and then
they'd make a shoe for that customer and

41
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:42,310
they take leather and they'd sew it and
then they give it in around $18 90.

42
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:46,780
We got this different idea as a species
where we should not sell two pairs of

43
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:50,830
shoes each day,
but 2 million and this idea of scaling

44
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:55,831
up has certain implications for how work
felt and part of that was because it was

45
00:02:56,501 --> 00:03:01,501
decided that the way to do this but have
extreme efficiency by breaking the work

46
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:06,940
and a really small tasks were most of
the people don't meet the customer.

47
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,310
Most of the people don't invent the
shoe.

48
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Most of the people don't.
Actually see the shoe made from

49
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:17,521
beginning to end and this idea of
removing the meaning from the work

50
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,040
wasn't intentional and the idea of
removing the curiosity from the job was

51
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:27,130
intentional.
For Henry Ford.

52
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,480
A curiosity was a bug that was a problem
and you needed to stamp it out in the

53
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:38,620
name of reliability and quality.
Now I'm not saying we're still acting

54
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:42,010
just like the 19 hundreds,
but I am saying that that's when we cut

55
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:46,420
our teeth on management practices and
the way we use control systems and

56
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:51,421
punishments and extrinsic rewards to
kind of call people out into doing

57
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:59,190
really repeated and sometimes tedious
tasks again and again and again without

58
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:05,560
having a sense of the bigger picture or
who uses the final product.

59
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,170
I think that that's part of where it
came from.

60
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,130
So a small organization in any industry
selling toner cartridges,

61
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,420
selling fruit,
selling shoes.

62
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,230
If you're just starting up and you've
only got 30 or 50 people working there,

63
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,010
everybody is curious.
Everybody's doing everything.

64
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:25,990
There aren't really tight role
descriptions.

65
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,860
The job titles are not burned into your
flesh.

66
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,310
The frame of your job is not sacred and
so you could be a delivery person,

67
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:37,600
but then if you see the competitors or
do something,

68
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,230
then you can be corporate espionage and
you can take back information and then

69
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:45,520
you can get into strategy and help
reinvent a response to what you saw and

70
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:48,940
that's actually not only acceptable,
it's desirable.

71
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,010
The CEO loves you for doing this.
When you get to have 50,000 people in an

72
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:57,610
organization,
you're supposed to stay in your lane.

73
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,000
You know,
the expectation is there are a set of

74
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,190
Kpis,
key performance indices,

75
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,880
and this is the way that we measure you
on your job and yeah,

76
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:10,480
it might be that you have ideas about
competitive advantage and what the

77
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:13,000
competitors are doing,
but there's no time for that because we

78
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:15,730
need you to do these things that we've
already set aside for you.

79
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,180
Again,
so I think it's in my own opinion,

80
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,220
a lot less about which industry and a
lot more about the culture and the

81
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:27,820
expectations for what different
employees can bring to the party.
