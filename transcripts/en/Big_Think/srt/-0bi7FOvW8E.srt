1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,770
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,153
no,
we have progressed in the gay rights 

3
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:12,240
movement,
but we haven't progressed as a result of

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,120
government policies are certainly not 
leadership at the federal level.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,390
I think what's remarkable is that the 
progress we've made,

6
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:19,224
despite the opposition from the federal 
government or some of the state 

7
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:24,450
governments,
it would have been unthinkable to me.

8
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:28,020
I'm 44 years old.
Two weeks ago when I was growing up,

9
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:30,300
I would've thought impossible for gay 
people to marry.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,770
Now we have it in many states,
including in some of the most remarkable

11
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:35,604
states that you could actually be 
pronounced husband and husband and wife 

12
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:41,540
and wife.
You can get buried in Dubuque Buca.

13
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,100
You can't get married in Chelsea or in 
San Francisco.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,133
Frankly.
The fact that we've made progress in 

15
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:49,920
places like that and Connecticut,
Massachusetts,

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,783
New Hampshire,
I think that speaks volumes about the 

17
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:53,574
power and the dynamism and the gay 
rights community that we see still the 

18
00:00:56,501 --> 00:01:00,300
federal government officials mumble when
it comes to questions around gay rights,

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,130
that these are not equal rights of 
ordinary American citizens.

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,900
We saw the Obama administration submit 
this brief in the,

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,190
in,
uh,

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,153
to defend the defense of marriage act 
and indefensible piece of law that was 

23
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:17,530
signed by President Clinton,
uh,

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,833
shows you that in fact,
democrats can sometimes not be a lot 

25
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,990
better than Republicans and some of the 
key civil rights,

26
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:25,824
civil liberties issues.
And here you had the Obama 

27
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:28,314
administration filed this brief 
defending the law in some of the most 

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,310
disgusting rhetoric and language.
Uh,

29
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,803
I understand the fact that justice 
department has to defend the laws 

30
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,144
enacted by Congress,
but the way they did so in that brief 

31
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:44,040
was really offensive to many gay,
lesbian people across this country.

32
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,060
And the fact that they had such a 
teenager that they couldn't realize that

33
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:48,894
the way they were going to defend this 
law was going to be in a way that would 

34
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:53,880
really infuriate gay,
lesbian people are across the country.

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,713
Who thought that we had embarked upon a 
very different time in our nation's 

36
00:01:59,041 --> 00:01:59,874
history.
And I think it's great that President 

37
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:03,450
Obama actually says the words gay and 
lesbian.

38
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,483
Uh,
I think it was notable that the Naacp 

39
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,433
Convention,
he talked about gay people still know 

40
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:08,824
having to civil rights and I think it's 
great that he had this ceremony 

41
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:15,150
commemorating the 40th anniversary of 
stonewall at the White House,

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,673
but frankly talk is cheap and there's 
only so long that a very eloquent and 

43
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,074
very thoughtful and very charismatic 
president will be able to get away on 

44
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:26,970
talk alone.
Frankly,

45
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:27,804
the policies and the outcomes and the 
decisions of that government has to 

46
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:36,000
measure up to the talk that both led him
into the White House.

47
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,140
And that is still allowing him to lead 
the public in very significant ways.

48
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,663
At one point,
we all turned off for when people's 

49
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,050
actions don't measure up to their words.

50
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,453
Uh,
I don't think anyone legitimately can 

51
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:52,211
say that.
Don't ask,

52
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:55,380
don't tell us worked.
Even the wife of the author of that,

53
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,760
uh,
the terrible policy,

54
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,640
a rat on a campaign,
it was a mistake to put,

55
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:01,474
don't ask,
don't tell in place that you created a 

56
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:05,470
witch hunt in the military that you can 
be gay.

57
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,720
You just can't ask about it.
You can't tell anyone about it.

58
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,170
But if you tell someone or someone asks 
about it,

59
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:12,970
then you could still be pushed out of 
the military.

60
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,320
It's,
it's,

61
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,440
it's ridiculous.
They promise to,

62
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,341
uh,
to undo.

63
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,300
Don't ask,
don't tell.

64
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,060
They are the bomb administration,
uh,

65
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,250
but they're saying now that they will,
they'll get to it and they're sweet.

66
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,910
They're sweet old time.
Uh,

67
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,640
it's really quite different if you're an
openly gay or lesbian,

68
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,320
serving in the military and putting your
life on the line for our country,

69
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,603
and yet your government can discriminate
against you and you could lose your job 

70
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,950
even as you,
you lay down your life for your country.

71
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,420
You could still be kicked out from that,
that posts or that,

72
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,910
that position.
And frankly there is no.

73
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,020
There's no reason why we ought to wait.
The,

74
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,160
it's not as if we're going to be able to
fix the economy or the healthcare or the

75
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:59,920
environment or even these wars in the 
near future.

76
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,060
And that frankly,
social change is not a sequential piece.

77
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:06,550
This is not like your college 
prerequisites.

78
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:08,510
We,
you take economics 100,

79
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,050
one before you go to economics due to,
oh one.

80
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,453
Frankly,
these issues all have to be dealt with 

81
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,463
aggressively and the idea that we will 
wait to deal with them just shows in 

82
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:19,144
fact that they're not a huge priority 
for this administration the way we had 

83
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:22,264
hoped and that in the way that many had 
voted for them to bring about that 

84
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:26,284
change.
I find it remarkable that increasingly 

85
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:32,530
the Obama administration is is 
sustaining withering attacks,

86
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:36,160
not just from civil libertarians about 
human rights and civil liberties,

87
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,890
but from the gay community,
from the women's community,

88
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,370
from young people,
from the antiwar activist.

89
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,810
We.
Those were the.

90
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,870
Those were the base that often created 
the seedbed that got him elected and yet

91
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:49,984
some of the major issues that I think 
propelled so many young people and so 

92
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:53,284
many different people to vote for this 
president are now other ones that we 

93
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:56,944
find on the back burner I think is 
actually not a very good political 

94
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:00,994
agenda.
It doesn't take a lot for a 25 year old 

95
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,323
to become disenchanted.
Once again with the political process 

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,833
and you know frankly when when folks 
turned out in record numbers and gave 

97
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:12,454
record amounts of money is because they 
want to see swift decisive change and 

98
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:17,794
that has yet to come about,
well certainly giving the full 

99
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:24,730
protection of health benefits to federal
government employees,

100
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,060
which is not what he's done a would be 
an important first step.

101
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,050
You're look at President Obama is like a
ceo of a major corporation,

102
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,500
right?

103
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,333
It's just like as if you were the CEO of
Walt Disney or apple and if you're 

104
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,700
concerned about the health and wellbeing
of your employees,

105
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,803
you want to protect them.
You want to protect them and their 

106
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:43,024
families.
I think it is remarkable that this 

107
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:47,140
president has said that even though a 
CEO,

108
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,380
the government workers of the United 
States of America,

109
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,813
that he won't provide healthcare 
benefits for same sex partners who work 

110
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,040
a for with the federal government.
That's something he could do.

111
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,050
That's something he ought to do.
Frankly.

112
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,780
If apple can get around to it or Nike 
can get around to it and Walt Disney,

113
00:06:06,781 --> 00:06:07,614
you can get around to it.
I think the CEO of United States of 

114
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,740
America can get around to that too.
It doesn't need congress.

115
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,620
It could just implement that.
Uh,

116
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,900
that was also another misstep on the gay
rights front.

117
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,243
Uh,
you Adama you had the mumbling on don't 

118
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:22,430
ask,
don't tell.

119
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,713
You had the lack of providing full 
healthcare benefits for federal 

120
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:26,654
government employees.
People begin to scratch their heads and 

121
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:29,714
wondering whether or not we're going to 
see the type of change we were hoping 

122
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:32,894
for.
And that's the type of change that the 

123
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:37,640
president can bring about.
He could also use the bully pulpit to be

124
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:40,370
very clear around marriage.
And in fact,

125
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:43,070
the president has said in his books and 
his public speaking,

126
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,480
that he struggles with the idea around 
marriage for lesbian and gay people.

127
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,290
Not that hard a,
frankly,

128
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,720
we don't have the same protections as 
straight people have.

129
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,313
No,
he is protected by the law of the 

130
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,023
presence protected by law.
He's got two beautiful daughters and a 

131
00:06:58,641 --> 00:07:03,080
wonderful first lady who's his wife.
And the law protects their family,

132
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,080
uh,
protects them from discrimination,

133
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,940
protects them in case anything were to 
go wrong with either one of the parents,

134
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,343
gay people across this country don't 
have the benefit of those legal 

135
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:11,684
protections.

136
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,033
And no matter how much they say they 
want to treat us as equal citizens and 

137
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:17,840
give us a full rights,
the fact is,

138
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:20,360
unless you move and you implement on 
those rights,

139
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,670
it's,
it's just rhetoric.

140
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:25,160
It's just a hortatory language.
Uh,

141
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,150
and frankly,
it,

142
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,013
the time has come for bold,
decisive leadership and seen it in 

143
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:32,630
states all across this country.
Frankly,

144
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,530
Massachusetts as married gay people now 
for over a year and some months.

145
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,873
And the institution of marriage,
I don't think there's any weaker and 

146
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:40,730
mess Massachusetts.
And is that.

147
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:43,730
It was three years ago.
We've seen it in Connecticut.

148
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,410
And frankly,
decisive,

149
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:47,270
clear action from the federal
