1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,780
The question,
why are some Americans,

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,890
people in the world homophobic,
why do they fear the gay and why did

3
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:13,380
they oppose,
at least in America so strongly,

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,750
gay marriage,
gay unions.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,280
I am not convinced that that many people
really have a problem with gay marriage.

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,430
I think there are some people who
absolutely hate and fear the gay and are

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,830
very opposed to the gay marriage.
I think it has become a consistent and

8
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:37,980
dependable fundraiser to where if every
homosexual person in America said,

9
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:39,900
okay,
we're awful,

10
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,610
we have a bad lifestyle and will slither
under the rock that we,

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,330
that we should be living under and we'll
never asked to be married again,

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,190
so we'll just take our queer assets and
scuttled back into the slimy shadows

13
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:58,191
where we belong with the slugs.
They would lose a major fundraising tool

14
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,200
and people in the room would go,
no,

15
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:01,650
no,
no.

16
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,960
Come back queer marriage.
Want to get married?

17
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:07,170
Guy,
we need you in the Bible belt.

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,780
We need you in South Carolina,
Arkansas,

19
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:10,830
Florida,
Texas.

20
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:15,660
To raise the bucks because Islamophobia
only goes so far,

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,400
but hating the gay.
That one always runs that one.

22
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:23,820
Always performs,
so you'll always,

23
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,950
you'll always have that,
you know,

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,410
up for debate.
What makes people fear the gay and gay

25
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:36,411
marriage is because you're giving these
people equality and that's the biggest

26
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:41,421
fear that people with power have that
you'll get some two people get married.

27
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,030
To me,
the whole contract is completely insane.

28
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,280
I live in the state of California.
If I married some Nice Gal and we got

29
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:54,090
divorced by law,
does she get half of my record

30
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:59,091
collection was no way.
She might after I get done with a

31
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,760
chainsaw,
but she's not getting my ramones first

32
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:03,810
pressing.
Oh No,

33
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:04,230
no.

34
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,200
She's not getting my Bob Ludwig mastered
version of houses.

35
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,150
The holy high.
I think not.

36
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,720
She can go on Ebay and overpaid like I
did for her own copy.

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,860
So marriage for me is I love to go to
weddings,

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,040
but I don't want to be married,
but if two people are crazy enough to be

39
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:27,660
that in love with each other,
that's a great thing.

40
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,430
Give them a break.
Lights really short.

41
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,270
Let him have a little happiness.
There's two men,

42
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:34,850
they're married,
they're in a house.

43
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,230
Houses are.
No,

44
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,920
it doesn't smell any different,
it doesn't look any different than the

45
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:44,880
lawn looks fantastic,
but a gay,

46
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:47,460
if you don't want to,
gay marriage and don't have one.

47
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:50,700
Same thing with abortion.
No woman wants to have an abortion,

48
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:54,630
but they gotta have the right to have
one safely without any.

49
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,800
Your opinion does not matter here and so
in,

50
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,770
in this century there's going to be gay
marriage is going to be okay in a more

51
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,660
than half of the United States,
but we used to have slaves,

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,200
so that's why we have amendments to the
constitution,

53
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,160
so it has wiggle room.

54
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,370
I think that gay marriage is already
covered under the first amendment,

55
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
so I,
I think this conversation's over to

56
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:26,230
where there shouldn't be against
anything against the law about two men

57
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:29,050
or women getting married.
It always breaks down to a religious

58
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:32,350
thing and they'll tell you,
well know they have all the equality

59
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:33,860
they need and Rara.
Wow.

60
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,750
Okay.
Then are you,

61
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,300
are you,
are you one of those radical Christian

62
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,051
as well?
I am.

63
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,390
That has nothing to do with it.
It it,

64
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,200
it kind of does a lot,
and so that's it.

65
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:46,330
Basically you have ignorance and you
have hatred.

66
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,020
What a lot of these people don't
understand is they are surrounded by the

67
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,550
gay,
you know,

68
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,140
they got gays in their family.
At thanksgiving I was at,

69
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,110
I went to an all boys school and I had
gay bosses as a kid growing up.

70
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:03,220
I lived in Washington DC,
which is just a lot of gay people.

71
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,650
My mom had gay friends.
I,

72
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,460
I got it,
I understood it.

73
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:08,290
I never feared it.
You know,

74
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,030
my,
my,

75
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,730
my Boston high school at the movie
theater with this was this amazing man

76
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:17,731
of Portuguese descent with incredible
hair who's like a fantastic old school

77
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,320
and like,
like character actor,

78
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,600
Oldschool Queen,
like,

79
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:25,360
you know,
his name was Bob on Saturday nights he

80
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:28,060
reverted to Roberta.
Roberta,

81
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,410
yes.
And like I,

82
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:34,480
I spent high school with this guy every
Saturday night at the movie theater.

83
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,250
We had the best time and if,
if my uptight friends from my suburban

84
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,440
prep school could have seen who I was
hanging out with,

85
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:42,640
I don't know what they would have
thought.

86
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,030
So I had no problem with the gay,
but it also gave me good Gaydar and in

87
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:50,320
high school,
well we all hit like ninth and 10th

88
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:51,190
grade,
whatever.

89
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,610
I realized like we've got gay,
we have at least two gay teachers and

90
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:58,780
I've got gay gay peers.

91
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,350
There's gay students.
One guy's Kinda like,

92
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,660
you know,
a mini Dick Cheney's that are just

93
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,850
keeping it to himself.
One guy like,

94
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,090
yeah,
you're gay and you're,

95
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,960
you know,
you're,

96
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:10,510
you're,
you're okay with it,

97
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,220
you know,
he's keeping it to himself.

98
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,040
And this is one poor guy who was like,
you know,

99
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,580
gay right now.
And he hit 10th or 11th grade and like,

100
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,160
Hello September at all.
Like,

101
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:25,540
no,
no,

102
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,920
because I just saw what was gonna happen
to him and we had some really bad

103
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:32,110
teachers there and one teacher would
make fun of him,

104
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,370
made fun of his name and turned it into
an anti gay slur.

105
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,300
So that teacher basically greenlighted
him if you know the term,

106
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:43,180
basically a green light of the guy for
is a death warrant because once the

107
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:46,630
teacher can do that,
that means you can do that.

108
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,500
This is not good leadership that
teachers should have never as an adult

109
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,270
with a bunch of stupid high school
students,

110
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:56,800
me being one of them should have never
okayed that and by the end of the school

111
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,450
day,
this guy had his head put in the toilet.

112
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,020
He was a dorm kid.
We had a dorm at the school for post

113
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:08,021
grads and kids who live far from home
and he got teased enough to where he

114
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:13,070
locked himself in his room and tried to
kill himself by slashing his wrists.

115
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,150
Thankfully he did not succeed,
but at Christmas break he left.

116
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:19,010
He never came back.
His name was never mentioned in the

117
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:19,940
school again,
ever.

118
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,220
Not by any teacher ever.
He never happened.

119
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,230
And that politicized me.
That made me Auntie homophobe.

120
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,090
I don't know how you say it,
but you know,

121
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:34,091
gay rights to me is it's civil rights
and it when I see racism,

122
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:37,760
which I encountered having it being done
to me as a kid from the sixties and

123
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:40,160
Washington DC.
When I see homophobia,

124
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:43,070
it's Kinda like,
it's that straw that breaks the camel's

125
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:44,150
back.
And I'm the camel.

126
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,013
I,
I,

127
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,200
I go hard against it real hard,
real loud,

128
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,470
real flagrantly,
real right now.

129
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,550
And so what you combated in America is a
lot of undereducated people who have

130
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:01,760
some idea that Christianity is about
beat up on the gay.

131
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:07,150
A lot of people just like to hate and a
gay person even though you're surrounded

132
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:09,650
by them.
And I,

133
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:11,600
as I,
as I tell my audiences that show,

134
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:13,880
they go dig it.
There was gay cavemen,

135
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,160
you know,
it gets your head around that.

136
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,900
There was like big hairy men from
millions of years ago going like,

137
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,320
Hey,
let's,

138
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,700
you know,
let's go hit the bushes and like see

139
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:27,960
what's up.
You'll gay pirates case,

140
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:29,600
Mri,
k everything.

141
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:35,230
And that's how it is.
Why some people can't absorb and accept

142
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:38,660
and deal with that information.
It's too bad.

143
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,900
I believe things are getting better.
I think homophobia is an endangered

144
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:47,690
species in America as long as I'm around
it is.

145
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,250
And I know I'm not the only person
pushing against him.

146
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:50,490
So.
