1
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:13,230
What catches my eye is
I truly feel that I am most touched by

2
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,740
work that has some sort of connection to
nature.

3
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,180
It is about the biomorphic even
zoomorphic if you want to be fanciful

4
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:28,900
tendencies of a certain piece and,
and,

5
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:29,510
and,
and,

6
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:34,510
and I've always found that I am a less,
of a hardcore modernist and more of an

7
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:39,880
organic surrealist modernist in terms of
my own taste and my own passion and what

8
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,890
I go for and when I'm trying to develop
new areas of a market with,

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,920
with my team when we're kind of saying,
you know,

10
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:51,340
something,
this Danish cabinet maker or Moose,

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,190
there's only been two of his works to
ever appear in America.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,390
Wouldn't it be great to like talk to
some folks and see if we can find more

13
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,820
of his work and bring it out.
It always seems to fall into that

14
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:03,260
organic kind of,
um,

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,810
aura for me.
You know,

16
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:05,940
you definitely,
mine

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,590
certainly.
