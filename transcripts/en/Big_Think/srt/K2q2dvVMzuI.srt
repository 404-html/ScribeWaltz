1
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,010
There is no quick solution to all of
this,

2
00:00:09,011 --> 00:00:11,830
but I want to,
of course,

3
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:16,810
the Security Council to use all the
tools available to them,

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,410
including sanctions,
looking at whether we can put

5
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:25,210
perpetrators to justice and to put them
on their lists.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,320
Um,
I want the government in the DRC and

7
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,910
everywhere where this is a problem.
It's not only an African problem to take

8
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:40,330
this seriously.
Also to do everything they can to ensure

9
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:45,331
that we put an end to impunity,
to address the problem of impunity and

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,640
also to assist the women to empower
women to make sure that they have a

11
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:55,390
voice and a seat at the table where
decisions are made.

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,200
And so there are a number of things that
the UN has to ensure that in

13
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:04,690
peacekeeping operations,
we can protect the civilians.

14
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:09,691
And that means women,
that we have to look at the best ways to

15
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:15,090
protect civilians
when we are contacted by a lot of people

16
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:22,931
who have great ideas about to equip
women with everything from sort of small

17
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,440
weapons that could help them to defend
themselves,

18
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:31,430
to,
to a communication gadgets.

19
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,720
You know,
that they can,

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,590
um,
uh,

21
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,880
one other women that they can call for
help,

22
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,000
etc. And I,
I think everything is worth testing.

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,800
Uh,
you know,

24
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,860
we hAve to do everything,
but the,

25
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,590
the thing is it should not fall on the
women to actually also have to sort of

26
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:54,620
physIcally defend themselves.
This is a response.

27
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:59,570
It's not a women's issue.
This is a peace and security issue and

28
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:02,440
we have to make sure that we go after
the perpetrators.

29
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:07,441
So I would put much more focused on,
on fInding the perpetrators and

30
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:12,641
punishing them to close every exit,
every possible career possibility for,

31
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,360
for these guys so that they know that
there is no mercy for,

32
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
for rapists.
