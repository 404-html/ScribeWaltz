1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,380
It's really tough to answer that because
it's very hard to trust your impressions

2
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:18,240
in real time.
I'm

3
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,470
in the conservative world.
Paper was starting to say already see,

4
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,350
uh,
it's all going to work in Iraq and

5
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:32,910
everybody's gonna thank Bush for this.
I'm skeptical of that.

6
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:37,440
I think the war in Iraq will look like a
mistake by Bush.

7
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,990
Um,
and that,

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,760
uh,
his,

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,590
um,
generally his,

10
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,530
his approach and foreign policy to,
you know,

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,580
as shoe diplomacy and go with unilateral
force will,

12
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,010
will be seen as having been
counterproductive and having decreased

13
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:02,190
rather than increased American influence
in the world.

14
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:07,191
So I would predict he would be seen as
rather unsuccessful president in the

15
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:12,180
realm of foreign policy.
I'm in the realm of domestic policy,

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,900
but in my opinion,
by far the most important thing he's

17
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:18,090
done is,
is uh,

18
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:22,230
the no child left behind law,
which has been wildly under covered by

19
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:23,064
the press.

20
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,550
And that'll take years to sift out.
But basically what he has done is it's a

21
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,720
little bit like Nixon to China because
you know,

22
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,420
that are Republican president did.
This is,

23
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:41,100
say for the first time we're going to
make the federal government a really

24
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:45,910
forceful dispositive presence in the
American public school system.

25
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:46,180
And,
and,

26
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,180
and really this will be seen as the
moment when we western Europeanized

27
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:56,500
ourselves and went from being a place
that,

28
00:01:56,501 --> 00:02:01,320
that where public education is seen as
completely local function to,

29
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,750
uh,
making it a much more of a national

30
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,280
function.
And,

31
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:07,950
and that'll play out in all sorts of
interesting ways,

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,080
whether good or bad.
I don't know.
