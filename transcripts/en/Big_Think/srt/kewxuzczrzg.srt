00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,650
If you start out a side project aiming
at it needs to make money,

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,470
you will make decisions on a complete
different level.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,000
I think the beauty of a side project is
that you are so playful and experimental

4
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:14,070
because you don't put the money
component on it.

5
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:16,440
You don't put a layer of money on top of
it.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,470
So I started my blog as my personal
visual archive of things I find online

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,670
that interests me and inspire me.
It was completely meant just to be my

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,260
personal archive and then slowly but
surely I realized because I started

9
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:32,790
looking at my stats and I was like,
oh my God,

10
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,610
this is not so personal anymore.
And eventually I realized,

11
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:37,500
Oh my God,
this is a growing community.

12
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:40,410
This is people coming back every day.
And then with that,

13
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:44,070
all of a sudden you get companies that
come to you and asks you,

14
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:44,641
Hey,
Hey,

15
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:45,840
can you put my product up here?

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,060
Hey can advertise.
And again,

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,120
this was not meant to be a business.
So when all of a sudden the aspect of

18
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:56,860
money comes at me,
I had to really do some thinking and

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,990
like,
do I want that?

20
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:02,991
It's just,
am I gonna hurt my credibility by

21
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:06,990
putting ads on here?
But then the interesting thing was when

22
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,670
I was approached by Jim coudal and he
told me the concept of the deck network,

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,490
it totally resonated with what I wanted
it to be.

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,950
Like for example,
the deck network,

25
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,770
um,
is a teeny tiny ed that is on the top

26
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:22,510
left side of my blog.
I'm,

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,680
that rotates a second rss feed that just
rotates in and out and it believes in

28
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:32,160
the concept of you can only have ads
that are really catered to your

29
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:34,020
audience.
So to creative audience.

30
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:36,150
So it's not noise,
but it's actually irrelevant.

31
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,520
So I realized,
Oh,

32
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,900
wait a second,
I could actually have advertising on my

33
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:44,850
site that is actually valuable to my
readers because he points out maybe

34
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:49,851
tools they would love to use.
There is a way that you can add value

35
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,220
with advertising if you have a site or
whatever it is that somebody wants to

36
00:01:55,891 --> 00:02:00,891
give you money for an exchange for
eyeballs just makes sure that it adds

37
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:07,431
value to whoever is reading your site,
that it is something that you completely

38
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:11,550
stand behind.
I will never ever write about something

39
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,580
if I don't love it and unfortunately
there's too many sites that debt just

40
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,600
say,
well,

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,650
we have to bring the Bacon home so we
just got to take this advertising and I

42
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:27,651
think that's where you ruin it.
That's where you lose the trust of your

43
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,600
readers,
your audience,

44
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,870
and there is nothing that a value more
than the trust of the people that come

45
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:41,481
back to my site everyday.
Your credibility is all you have and I

46
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:44,970
think it doesn't have to do anything.
Whether you run a blog or not,

47
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,170
it's in your day to day like don't lose
your credibility.

48
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:49,980
Don't sell out.
