1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:09,330
Game of politics for many decades has
been played as one in which you're

2
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:12,420
supposed to keep your head down.
You're supposed to be bland,

3
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:16,980
you're supposed to be uncontroversial,
your job is to court as many people as

4
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:18,330
you can.
In the middle.

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,340
Donald trump,
from the very beginning,

6
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:24,960
took a different posture.
Everything he did was about unleashing

7
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:28,730
the agency of a small number of intense
support.

8
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:33,330
So this was going to be a campaign in
which you could unleash the things that

9
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:37,020
you'd been thinking,
maybe you're mad uncle monitoring at the

10
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:38,420
television,
um,

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,940
and suddenly every mat,
uncle mattering and the television was

12
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:45,780
empowered,
was sent a signal by this man that those

13
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:48,150
private thoughts could now be made
public.

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,410
As Donald Trump's candidacy unfolded,
he built and created a symbiotic

15
00:00:55,711 --> 00:01:00,711
relationship with what we think of as a
vast decentralized social media army

16
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,350
that did his bidding during the
campaign.

17
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,030
These were mostly young white men on
platforms like reddit and four Chan.

18
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:11,820
And they develop this kind of culture of
competing with each other,

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,390
vying with each other to produce the
most creative,

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,370
the most sticky,
uh,

21
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:22,371
the most intrusive meme or message that
would penetrate social media and then

22
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:27,870
seep into the mainstream media.
So everyday they would do this and in

23
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:32,250
response to the events of the new cycle,
be it Hillary Clinton's latest comments

24
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:34,830
be at Donald Trump's latest policy
pronouncements.

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,980
They would go take that moment and
elevated the mainstream media would

26
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:42,990
generally confident that Hillary would
win the election.

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,650
She was ahead in the polls fairly
consistently and because she had much

28
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:49,830
higher favorables while both candidates
were unpopular,

29
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,210
Hillary's favorables in public opinion
polls were generally about 10 points

30
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:58,920
higher than Donald Trump's,
but the people doing social media

31
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,980
sentiment analysis firms like foresee
we're tracking and finding something

32
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:05,004
very different.

33
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,430
Their job is to track net sentiment on
social media.

34
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,960
I'm in connection to political debates.
And what they were finding throughout

35
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:15,780
the campaign was that while Donald
Trump's favorables,

36
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:18,060
we're about 10 points lower than
Hillary.

37
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,300
His net favorable it on social media was
about 10 points higher than Hillary.

38
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,110
One of the most striking facts we
discovered when researching this book

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,440
was that the day that Donald Trump had
the highest net favorability on social

40
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,470
media was his darkest day of the
campaign.

41
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:41,250
It was the day of the access Hollywood
tape being released,

42
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,820
and it was because at that day his
supporters who had such intensity of

43
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:52,611
commitment to him rallied around him.
They surged to his defense and even

44
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:57,360
though it seemed in the mainstream media
like this was the day that was all

45
00:02:57,361 --> 00:03:01,300
losing for Donald Trump on social media
that day,

46
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,490
Donald trump actually won.
He was elected because he intuitively

47
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:11,491
understood what we call new power and
new power is this ability to harness the

48
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:14,620
energy of a connected crowd.

49
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,130
And while Hillary Clinton had a very
traditional relationship with her crowd,

50
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,750
Donald Trump had a relationship that
reflects what we now know you need to do

51
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,080
in order to really build depth of
commitment politically.

52
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,060
So the NRA understands intensity in the
same way that Donald trump does.

53
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,130
One of its great strengths is in
addition to its old power brand.

54
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,970
The fact that it's a feared institution
that politicians kind of quiver at the

55
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:47,971
thought of it also has an incredibly
powerful new power arm and that arm goes

56
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:52,990
beyond just its membership.
It actually has been very effective at

57
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,470
cultivating the most extreme elements of
its support base.

58
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:59,680
If you listen to an NRA ad now,
they actually don't really talk about

59
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,740
guns anymore.
They talk about this conspiratorial

60
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:06,940
worldview.
They pit liberals against people with

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,820
their values.
They suggest that government is on a

62
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:14,821
mission to take away people's liberties
and what they've learned is that the way

63
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:20,350
to keep intensity in their crowd,
the way therefore at moments that really

64
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,930
matter for it like the mansion to me,
Bill.

65
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,800
Well you remember when that bill came to
Congress after the newtown massacre,

66
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,880
90 percent of Americans supported
background checks in public opinion

67
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:33,820
polls.
Yet the 10 percent of people who oppose

68
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:34,810
them.
One,

69
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:40,090
and the reason I did was at that moment
the NRA was able to rally the intensity

70
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:45,091
of its supporters to a outnumber for gun
control forces eight to one in calls to

71
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:52,861
the key senators who were the swing
votes on that issue and the way they've

72
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:55,840
done that is not by reigning in their
supporters,

73
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,050
but actually unleashing their agency by
providing micro grants to small,

74
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,050
highly extreme political organizations
at the grassroots level all over the

75
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:12,010
country by supporting the commerce,
the culture,

76
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,270
the politics,
and the totalizing worldview of gun

77
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:21,040
rights supporters and in doing so,
they've actually been led by their

78
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,170
extremes,
but it's their extremes that are helping

79
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:26,500
them to keep the power that they have.

80
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,750
The question that those of us who want a
world that's different to the world that

81
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:34,180
Donald trump is building is how do we
stop him?

82
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,980
What will it take?
It won't be another candidate who is

83
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:43,060
marginally more favorable or popular
than Donald Trump,

84
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,980
but lacks the intensity,
that capacity to mobilize new power that

85
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:51,580
Donald Trump demonstrated.
It will need to be a candidate.

86
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,080
It will need to be a movement that has
real intensity behind it.

87
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,570
You know,
we think of those Parkland kids and to

88
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:02,480
me,
they're the hope because what they're

89
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:06,530
showing is they understand this need to
generate intensity.

90
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,700
They understand how to use new power.
They've got this intuitive understanding

91
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:14,660
that it's not enough just to be right.
It's not enough just to stretch out the

92
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:19,661
facts that you have to embody that
message in a way that means that if your

93
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,990
a,
your kid,

94
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,600
anywhere in the world,
you can take that,

95
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,490
adapt it,
make it your own.

96
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,520
These movements tend to be
decentralized.

97
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,880
They tend to not have strict messaging
associated with them and they tend to be

98
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:38,960
structured in such a way like the me
too.

99
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:43,880
Movement where you can take a frame,
adapted an agile boards.
