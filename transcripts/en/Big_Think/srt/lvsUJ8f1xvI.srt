00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:14,410
It's kind of funny cause
after the elections I was at this press

2
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:19,461
conference for Black Youth vote and I
was talking about all the work that we

3
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:23,370
did with our campaign powerboat and
they'll,

4
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:27,420
so this article came out with in the
Associated Press and basically I had

5
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:29,700
said a statement that's like,
well,

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,710
and this really happened,
you know,

7
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:32,940
after the elections,

8
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,900
Fox News and,
and white people.

9
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:40,060
I just knew we're like,
yeah this is great.

10
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:42,190
You know,
racism is over now that we have a black

11
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:43,990
president.
And it's like,

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,600
first of all,
your statement in of itself shows that

13
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:50,770
racism isn't dead because if it was you
wouldn't acknowledge that he was black

14
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:52,420
in the first place.
Um,

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,150
and so it gotten like 200 different
papers,

16
00:00:58,151 --> 00:01:03,151
like randomly who's like really strange.
But I got things like face,

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,890
like,
like these blogs,

18
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:08,350
these conservative bloggers like
attacking me.

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,570
And that was the first time it was like,
Whoa,

20
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,130
like,
you know,

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,480
googling my name,
finding images and putting it on blogs

22
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:20,481
so they could talk stuff about me and
that with like crazy to me.

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,953
But

24
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,620
it was like they were upset cause I had
the audacity to say that no,

25
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:32,670
racism isn't dead.
And even though we Obama won,

26
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:36,660
we still have to work.
Like it's not just going to be up to

27
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:38,400
Obama.
He's not a superhero.

28
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:42,780
He is a super motivator.
And he is motivated our generation to

29
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:43,561
say,
why not?

30
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,620
Why not create change?
Why not be the best generation we can

31
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:47,490
be?
Why not,

32
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,830
you know,
stand up for what we believe in.

33
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:53,910
Why not just be more successful?
Why not just try harder?

34
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:57,630
Why not just advocate?
Why not just go into Congress and to

35
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:59,360
Capitol Hill and lobby our
congresspeople?

36
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,010
It's not that hard.
And he's done all that.

37
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,930
But like I said,
he's not a superhero.

38
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,850
And so it was funny to me because they
were mad that I said racism isn't dead.

39
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,600
But it was like in their statements,
they were racist to like,

40
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:18,420
one was like niggers are still whining
and,

41
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,370
um,
you know,

42
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:24,000
you're only 23,
what do you know about racism or all

43
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:25,170
these different things?
And

44
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,313
I just,

45
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,330
it's very interesting to me.
So I think,

46
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:32,580
uh,
even with Obama in office,

47
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:37,581
we have a long road ahead of people of
having to just build intercultural

48
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:42,270
politics and intercultural communication
that

49
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,860
is more uplifting and uniting.
And I think that as a coalition energy

50
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,510
action coalition has been working
really,

51
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:54,690
really hard to try and develop that as a
goal,

52
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:56,090
as a true strategic goal.
