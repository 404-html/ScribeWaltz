1
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:16,050
Trauma is something that's unexpected
out of our control and outside of our

2
00:00:16,511 --> 00:00:20,380
ability to prevent it.
And so that really by definition is a

3
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:22,750
loss.
You can have the loss of life,

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,510
the loss of physical control,
which is an injury,

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,500
the loss of emotional control,
which is a mental health need.

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,960
You can have a financial loss.
So loss of that nature brings trauma

7
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,700
and mass casualty can take the form of a
violent crime or an individual's

8
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:47,130
involved in harming lots of other
people.

9
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:50,910
It can be a natural disaster.
It can be a combination of those things.

10
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,320
Many times in the public,
people don't know how to respond and so

11
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,910
they kind of default to what they would
perceive to be something that's helpful.

12
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,630
So donating clothes,
knitting things,

13
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:05,670
sending food,
this kind of thing.

14
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,640
And ironically,
in many situations that's not really

15
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:11,280
that helpful.
Somebody drove a truck,

16
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,720
a tractor trailer full of fruitcake and
actually parked it in the middle of the

17
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:16,900
disaster zone.
You know,

18
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,740
one,
forget it would be funny actually,

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,290
but you know,
in in the midst of this natural

20
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,240
disaster,
it's not the right kind of resources

21
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:28,140
that to big people typically need.
They need other kinds of resources and

22
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,003
those needs,
uh,

23
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,820
commonly revolve around immediate safety
and security issues.

24
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,010
Uh,
immediate,

25
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,120
immediate emotional support and then
time to recover to some degree.

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,830
What do you typically get when you say,
well,

27
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:43,170
is there anything I can do for you?
Well,

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,310
there's nothing.
You know,

29
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:47,760
I'm,
I'm fine when at that casket,

30
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:51,390
when you make that comment to that widow
at her,

31
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,550
you know,
her husband's visitation,

32
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,230
she's not thinking,
yeah,

33
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:59,700
the grass hasn't been mowed and my
mortgage needs to be paid and the dog

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,450
needs to be let out.
All very practical things.

35
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,260
And many times that's really what we
need to focus on.

36
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,230
How do we discover those practical needs
by asking them

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,090
in the aftermath of a situation,
people are recovering emotionally,

38
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:22,320
physically,
financially,

39
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,950
and many times those needs are lifelong.
If a person loses his or her job and

40
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:33,360
can't work,
that's an issue of disability.

41
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,550
That's a need.
Paying funeral expenses,

42
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:38,100
dealing with medical expenses,
medical bills,

43
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,830
sometimes they're still trying to make
their house payment.

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,260
Do they have resources to be able to
manage with that?

45
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,560
Do they have the ability to get worker's
comp or longterm disability that can be

46
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:51,740
questionable?
A manager of a compensation program is

47
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:55,860
State Compensation Program told me that
they consider the average cost of a

48
00:02:55,861 --> 00:03:00,490
shooting victim who survived to be
roughly $50,000 that's,

49
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,460
that's the calculable consideration for
their costs,

50
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:08,110
their expenses,
and so even just financially,

51
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,400
you know,
that's,

52
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,630
that's where donations can be helpful
and so it's important for the public to

53
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:16,990
be thoughtful,
to make sure that whatever account that

54
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:22,050
you might be contributing to is actually
the legitimate take an extra step or to

55
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,780
ask some questions to do a google search
and to make sure it's legitimate and

56
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,044
authentic.

57
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,540
When you think about how we respond to a
person,

58
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,960
we challenge people to ask the question,
am I really defining their trauma for

59
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:45,850
them by the statement that I'm making?
For instance,

60
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,460
God wanted your loved one more than you
did.

61
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,090
That's why he took your loved one.
Well,

62
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,250
when you kind of examine that phrase,
what are we really doing?

63
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,250
We're defining that loss for that
individual.

64
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,300
Most people who are experiencing that
kind of loss would say,

65
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,740
that's not helpful.
I don't find actually that that is

66
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:08,800
comforting to me.
Comforting phrases,

67
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:13,720
truly comforting phrases are really the
kind of phrases that empower the person

68
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,870
to have control.
One of the big phrases that we use

69
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:19,390
really in terms of crisis intervention
is,

70
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,130
I'm so sorry that your loved one died
and use that person's name.

71
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,190
I'm so sorry that bill died because
we're,

72
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,870
we're affirming the value of that person
that they've lost and we're affirming

73
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,570
the reality of what they've experienced.
Now,

74
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,880
the easiest thing,
believe it or not,

75
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:39,880
is to say nothing,
and that can be helpful just to be with

76
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:41,740
a person.
If we don't know what to say,

77
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,380
you can simply say,
I'm here with you.

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,760
I just want to support you.
