1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,710
Gonna make me blush.
I do.

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,950
I was working for a gay organization.
I was in a lesbian bar in Texas.

3
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,180
Um,
Dallas and I,

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,990
uh,
was up until that point had a boyfriend,

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,530
thought I was completely straight and 
she hit on me.

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,590
And I remember feeling very flattered 
and a surprisingly interested.

7
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,783
She was confident.
I think it was the confidence that 

8
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:39,774
really pulled me in.
They surprised me because I have a 

9
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:50,280
master's degree in women's studies.
When I was in graduate school,

10
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:54,400
I lived with a troop of drag kings and,
um,

11
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,583
I had been around the lesbian community 
for years and was never interested in 

12
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:06,630
anyone in the community.
So when this happened,

13
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,140
I thought the question had already been 
settled for me.

14
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,950
Um,
that I was a straight ally working for a

15
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:17,670
gay organization.
I was working for glad at the time.

16
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:22,560
And um,
so it surprised me and I went home and I

17
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,620
called my sister and I said,
this woman hit on me and I don't know,

18
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:29,820
I think I kind of liked it.

19
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,200
And she was like,
oh,

20
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:33,270
it's no big deal.
I've kissed lots of girls.

21
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:34,350
Who Cares?
Um,

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,690
so,
um,

23
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:41,400
and she was straight also.
So that was surprising too.

24
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,130
I didn't know that about her.
And um,

25
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,960
you know,
I remember at the time it was a little,

26
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:51,330
it was probably a little scary and 
nothing,

27
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,090
you know,
nothing happened that evening,

28
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,380
but it got me thinking and it got me 
thinking in a very different way.

29
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:02,220
And it sounds cheesy,
but I really started,

30
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,120
I,
you know,

31
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:03,954
I can remember driving down the street 
and envisioning my life completely 

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,893
differently,
envisioning getting married but to a 

33
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:13,584
woman,
an envisioning having a life but with a 

34
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:19,650
woman and coming home to a woman and I 
really,

35
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,760
you know,
I dunno,

36
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,930
it was like this door opened that hadn't
been opened before and I thought,

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,240
Huh,
that could be my life.

38
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:32,820
And it seemed really exciting and 
really,

39
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,520
right.
It just made sense.

40
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,120
I had different experiences.
I think that most people,

41
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:42,954
because I was working at a gay 
organization and they for a couple of 

42
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,480
years had gotten used to me being,
you know,

43
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:50,810
the straight ally that work to the gay 
organizations.

44
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:51,644
So I had to go there and sort of come 
out in a reverse sense and say to 

45
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:56,610
everybody,
look,

46
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,620
I,
I thought I was straight too,

47
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,880
but I'm not,
um,

48
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,830
I'm actually gay.
And it was surprising.

49
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,860
A lot of people were really,
I remember being very nervous and very,

50
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,540
I felt a lot of,
you know,

51
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,733
I was proud to be a straight ally and 
work at a gay organization and I felt 

52
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:16,564
really,
I carried a lot of responsibility to 

53
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:22,610
sort of educate other straight people 
and bring people in.

54
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,483
And so I felt,
I think there was some part of me that 

55
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,890
felt like I was maybe letting people 
down.

56
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,300
And then I got over that pretty quickly 
and thought,

57
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:32,710
well,
this is the whole point.

58
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:35,200
This is what we're fighting for,
this is who I am.

59
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:38,290
And it's okay.
There were some people at work that were

60
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,090
sort of like,
that's fine,

61
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:42,040
you're experimenting,
just,

62
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,140
you know,
test it out.

63
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:44,974
And I was,
which sort of irked me a little bit 

64
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:48,880
because I thought,
no,

65
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:50,230
I'm not,
this isn't just,

66
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,240
you know,
a flaming,

67
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:54,250
it's like,
I really,

68
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,990
I think this is who I am.
So it just shows that we all have,

69
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,543
you know,
our own biases and assumptions that we 

70
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:06,760
carry around.
And then when I came out to my parents,

71
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,530
I was very naive and my parents are very
liberal.

72
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,423
Um,
my dad was a retired as a school 

73
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:18,160
superintendent and my mom was a social 
worker and,

74
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,100
um,
was,

75
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,720
uh,
worked at a black community center up in

76
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:27,130
Syracuse and they were very liberal 
compared to every other,

77
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,860
you know,
all of their friends,

78
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:31,120
all of our neighbors.

79
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,470
So I thought this would be a nonissue.
And they had gay friends,

80
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:36,304
you know,
my mom was the person at work who would 

81
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:42,580
stand up for the gay guy.
And I've never heard my dad tell an anti

82
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:46,450
gay joke or anything like that.
And when I came out,

83
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,490
um,
you know,

84
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:51,970
I was very surprised because my mother 
has such a traditional,

85
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,910
like reaction and she's not a 
traditional person,

86
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,530
which was like,
oh my God,

87
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,930
what?
You're never going to have kids.

88
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,710
You're never going to,
you had a husband and have this life.

89
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:04,540
And you know,
I was like,

90
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,640
who are you?
This is not,

91
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,740
I've never heard you say things like 
this.

92
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,843
Um,
and it took many years for her to 

93
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,220
eventually become okay with that.
Uh,

94
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,090
so it was a process and I didn't expect 
it to be,

95
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:20,380
so that was surprising.

96
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,273
Okay.
