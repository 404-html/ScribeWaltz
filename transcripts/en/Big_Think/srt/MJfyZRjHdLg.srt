1
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,180
Well,
science is telling us that we can do

2
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,210
phenomenal things if we put our minds
and our resources to us.

3
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,290
I mean,
I think science is probably the best

4
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:27,291
example of you put resources into
something and you let the creativity and

5
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:31,290
the brilliance of the minds throughout
the world and certainly not only in this

6
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,550
country,
throughout the world,

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,070
and phenomenally good things can happen.
You've got to make sure that there's

8
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,730
checks and balances on that because
science can also lead to things that are

9
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:42,840
not so good.
You know?

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,920
And that is a whole ethical issues of
manipulating at the genomics,

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,590
at the genomic level,
the whole issues of,

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,720
of embryos and creating people to your
own fashionable boutique,

13
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,670
liking all those things.
You've got to really be very,

14
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,510
very careful that,
but science at its most pure where

15
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:03,420
you're sweet,
you're looking for discovery and you're

16
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:06,090
going to use discovery for the
betterment of mankind.

17
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,560
I think science stands out among more
some of the most important,

18
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,190
uh,
endeavors that the humankind can pursue.

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,860
Mankind evolves.
I mean,

20
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:21,861
there's no doubt that we have evolved
the whole issue of evolving through

21
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:26,910
various lower species.
To our own species of the human.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,360
But there's also the continuing
evolution,

23
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,560
uh,
uh,

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,680
that is associated with mankind.
And a lot of that is using what

25
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,600
specifically and particularly and
peculiarly makes you a human being.

26
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,210
And that is your intellect and your
will.

27
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,810
You have a choice.
You can analyze things and you can act

28
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:52,890
in an intellectual manner.
And that is to me that the very

29
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:57,891
foundation of what science is,
how you can better your own lot,

30
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,830
the lot of the other citizens of the
world while you're paying attention to

31
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:08,310
and preserving the world you live in,
which is the reason why things like the

32
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:10,800
environment are so,
so important.

33
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,000
When we try and analyze all we doing
things that are detrimental to the

34
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,860
environment.
And if so,

35
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,890
how do we stop it?
And if we have to stop it,

36
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,000
how do we replace it with something
that's environmentally friendly?

37
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,880
And I think science is going to lead us
there.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,320
And it's the goodwill that you have to
try and preserve your own species as

39
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:33,010
well as preserve the environment,
I.

40
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,440
E.
Our planet.

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,590
Uh,
so that we can have thousands of more

42
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,340
years of,
of,

43
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,930
of,
of,

44
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,160
of people doing good things and leading
good lives.
