1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,320
There's a lot of interesting new
technology that scrubs job descriptions

2
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:13,460
for gendered words because the layer,
literally the ways that companies are

3
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:18,461
presenting opportunities is screening
out women are self screening out because

4
00:00:19,221 --> 00:00:21,170
they're seeing words that they don't
relate to,

5
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:21,770
uh,
resonate.

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,140
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

7
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:26,540
So there's literally like technology is
going to have to help us shortcut our

8
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:30,920
biases because we are so unfortunately
kind of hopeless when it comes to.

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,940
It's true with me,
it's really hard wired into us to be

10
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:39,220
biased against maybe ourselves and
believing the stereotypes we hear,

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,380
uh,
but then also particularly bias coming

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,440
out us of course,
from folks who have not done the work

13
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:46,440
around,
you know,

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,740
their own choices.
Right?

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,660
Getting us into boxes.
So I want to know from you,

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,690
so when you experienced in your career,
maybe some stereotype threat and how did

17
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:57,380
you correct for it?

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,990
When you know that it may be being
applied to Ya,

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,340
how do you not get swamped by that?
It's like the death by a thousand cuts,

20
00:01:04,341 --> 00:01:04,950
you know,
it's,

21
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,080
it does accumulate and then it causes a
lot of us frankly,

22
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:11,300
to leave organizations.
Absolutely.

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,650
Like we don't even,
we can't even put a death,

24
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,950
a fine point on it,
but we feel,

25
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,680
don't feel valued and heard and
welcomed.

26
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:21,110
Right?
So how did you overcome that and kind of

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,270
claim your power and.
Yeah,

28
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:24,990
that's in line with a question.
Um,

29
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,320
so first by way of background as a
professor at Columbia and the first

30
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:33,560
African American to ever be tenured in
the sciences since,

31
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,280
you know,
since,

32
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,820
since Columbia started,
so that says a lot.

33
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:40,790
So that says,
I think it's incredible achievement,

34
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,620
but also says a lot about,
about,

35
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,570
uh,
about even where,

36
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:46,970
where we are today because people think
I don't struggle.

37
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,970
I struggle every single day.
I have perfectionistic syndrome where I

38
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:57,950
work on an article for a year and then I
work on it for another year and I know

39
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,530
the literature that women are more
likely to do that,

40
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:04,580
that perfectionistic syndrome is linked
to being worried about being

41
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:06,320
stereotyped.
I,

42
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,570
um,
make lots of decisions where,

43
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,520
where I,
I think very carefully about how I am

44
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,020
perceived by others.
And oftentimes I'll be in say a faculty

45
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:21,260
meeting or even when I'm talking to
companies and senior leaders and I'm

46
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:21,980
like,
well,

47
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,730
how many common should I make about race
versus gender versus religion?

48
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:28,250
Like am I being seen as too this or too
that.

49
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,830
So I worry about these things all the
time.

50
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,020
But a couple of things I know to be
true.

51
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,520
One is that when you take calculated
risks,

52
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,980
you know,
and you of put yourself a little bit out

53
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:43,190
there,
almost always something amazing happens.

54
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,910
And so that is one thing that I've
learned to.

55
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,150
I really believe that the whole
diversity and inclusion architecture,

56
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,500
people don't understand the underlying
science and when they understand that

57
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,070
it's not about bad people doing bad
things,

58
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:04,090
but about these structural differences,
it sort of gives me hope.

59
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,080
And that helps me take these calculated
risks.

60
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,060
And I think the third thing is just me
personally knowing like I will feel

61
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:16,120
anxiety every time I sit down to write a
paper and I go,

62
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,760
I'm the first African American tenured
in the sciences.

63
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:21,130
This has got to be really good.
You know,

64
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,140
this has to be like great,
like what does,

65
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:23,890
what,
what do I,

66
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,810
what do I do?
Whenever I think about that,

67
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,870
I understand that that's coming partly
from an environment where there's lots

68
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:35,080
of stereotypes.
Just knowing that sort of helps me kind

69
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,150
of take a little bit off in terms of
anxiety,

70
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:40,120
but it's something that I still work
through everyday and it's something that

71
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,960
I work with senior leaders to help
eliminate that.

72
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,140
When you see underperformance.
So in my field,

73
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:49,450
it's how many articles are you writing a
year,

74
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:53,140
but in the corporate world it might be
how many dollars are you bringing in or

75
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:56,620
how many clients are you going to see or
what your investment portfolio looks

76
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:58,060
like.
What I tell people is that

77
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,750
underperformance is,
doesn't mean that you can't do it.

78
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,010
It might be something else that maybe
there's something about the structure.

79
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,450
So,
but you must have the same at least

80
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,900
kinds of experiences.
I love to do.

81
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,590
I think that perfectionism is gendered.
Uh,

82
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:15,490
yes.
And,

83
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,540
and if I were a person of color,
I'd have it even worse because I think

84
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,360
when you're the only,
there's so much pressure on your

85
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:26,050
shoulders and this is the problem with
the demographics as we see them in many

86
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:29,680
companies are particularly at the senior
level when you are the only,

87
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:33,400
there is just an undue amount of
performance expectations.

88
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,820
It feels riskier because
you're at that table like clinging to

89
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:44,620
something that you've achieved and that
you are the first.

90
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:47,110
Yes.
And so I think that it's double work,

91
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:50,500
as you said earlier,
and triple work to not only be

92
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:53,620
proficient and excellent,
but to be managing,

93
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:55,600
am I safe here?
Am I welcomed here,

94
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,030
my valued here?
Am I a token?

95
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,871
Yes.
You know,

96
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:02,140
all of those things that go through our
heads and so that's why I loved your

97
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:06,880
comment about like who has supported you
to help you believe not only do you

98
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:09,250
belong here,
but that you know you're,

99
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,760
you're a star and there are many stars
behind you.

100
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,910
You know that you're actually paving the
way for.

101
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,510
I know in so much of my work with,
with lower level employees or early in

102
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:23,200
career seeing leaders like you who did
make it,

103
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,760
just that the,
the power of being able to see yourself

104
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,940
reflected in someone who's achieved and
who is the first is.

105
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,460
So it is one of those things that I
think leaders don't understand their

106
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,440
role models every single day.
Everything you do.

107
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,690
Absolutely.
And the fact that you rather a lot.

108
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,860
You're your,
uh,

109
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:43,480
thank you.
I appreciate that.

110
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,540
Um,
so I remember early on in my career,

111
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,700
and this is something that when I worked
with earlier,

112
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,430
early career employees,
I also talked to them about.

113
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,820
I used to ask people for feedback
constantly and I would go find the

114
00:05:57,921 --> 00:06:02,210
person who I knew was going to be the
most critical and I would say tell me

115
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:04,730
about my work even though I was really
fearful.

116
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,200
So fast forward,
I've done research over the past 15

117
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:14,201
years showing that people with some kind
of outsider status are less likely to

118
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:18,590
receive informal feedback.
So everyone received formal feedback,

119
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,790
which is,
you know,

120
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,650
at the end of the year or you're mid
career,

121
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,610
your mid year review,
but the watercooler feedback,

122
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,990
which is I really matters what really
matters.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,600
Like,
Hey,

124
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,700
I think that you should be doing this,
or hey,

125
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,210
have you thought about this or hey,
this new something or other came out and

126
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:38,330
you should do this or hey,
you probably didn't pull it together the

127
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,980
way you should have,
but you know,

128
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,030
come back the next day.
That informal feedback is really what

129
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,960
sort of pushes people in one and when
one direction or another.

130
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,540
And so there,
there are all of these subtle.

131
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,890
So the way I always think about it is
what is the structure of the company

132
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,100
that either gives rise or facilitate
stereotypes and really unconscious ways,

133
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,960
or what is the company doing to mitigate
those stereotypes.

134
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:09,110
And that is all at a very unconscious
level.

135
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:09,910
Mm.
