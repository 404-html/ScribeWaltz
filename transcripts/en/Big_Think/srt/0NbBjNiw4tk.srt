1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,793
My name is professor Michio Kaku.
I'm a professor of theoretical physics 

2
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:20,230
at the City University of New York and I
specialize in is something called string

3
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:21,064
theory.

4
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,990
I'm a physicist and some people asked me
the question,

5
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,110
what has physics done for me lately?
I mean,

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,033
do I get better colored television?
Do I get better Internet reception with 

7
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:36,650
physics?
And the answer is yes.

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,753
Is he physics?
Is that the very foundation of matter 

9
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:43,730
and energy?
We physicists invented the laser beam.

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,960
We invented the transistor.
We helped to create the first computer.

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,760
We helped to construct the internet.
We rode the world wide web.

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,420
In addition,
we also helped to invent television,

13
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,900
radio radar microwave's,
not to mention MRI scans,

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,980
pet scansx,
rays.

15
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,910
In other words,
almost everything you see in your living

16
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:08,744
room,
almost everything you see in a modern 

17
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:15,050
hospital at some point or other can be 
traced to a physicist.

18
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,720
Now,
I got interested in physics when I was a

19
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:22,040
child when I was eight.
A great scientist had just died.

20
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,443
I still remember my elementary school 
teacher coming into the room and 

21
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:30,761
announcing that the greatest scientist 
of our era has just passed away and that

22
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:36,770
day every newspaper published a picture 
of his desk,

23
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:41,750
the desk of Albert Einstein,
and the caption said,

24
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,613
I'll never forget the unfinished 
manuscript of the greatest work of the 

25
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:50,930
greatest scientists of our time.
And I said to myself,

26
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,210
why couldn't he finish it?
I mean,

27
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,850
what's so hard?
It's a homework problem,

28
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:58,130
right?
Why didn't he ask his mother?

29
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,700
Why can't he finish this problem?
So as a child of eight,

30
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:03,950
I decided to find out what was this 
problem?

31
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,263
Years later,
I began to realize that it was the 

32
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,930
theory of everything that unified field 
theory,

33
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,783
an equation that would summarize all the
physical forces in the universe and 

34
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:19,634
equation like e equals MC squared.
That equation is half an inch long and 

35
00:02:25,131 --> 00:02:27,950
that equation unlocks the secrets of the
stars.

36
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,030
Why do this star is shy?
Why does the Galaxy light up?

37
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:32,864
Why do we have energy on the earth?
But then there was another thing that 

38
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:38,630
happened to me when I was around eight 
years old.

39
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,913
I got hooked on the Saturday morning tv 
shows in particular Flash Gordon and I 

40
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:47,294
was hooked.
I made every Saturday morning watching 

41
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:53,080
programs about alien from outer space,
stars,

42
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:55,990
ships,
ray guns in visibility,

43
00:02:55,991 --> 00:02:58,160
shields,
cities in the sky.

44
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,293
That was me,
but after a few years I began to notice 

45
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:03,610
something.
First of all,

46
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:04,960
I began to notice that,
well,

47
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:09,640
I didn't have blond hair and blue eyes.
I didn't have muscles like Flash Gordon,

48
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,120
but it was a scientist who made this 
series work.

49
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,610
In particular,
a physicist.

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,330
He was the one who discovered the 
Reagan,

51
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:20,164
the star ships.
He was the one who created the 

52
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,970
invisibility shield,
and then I realized something else.

53
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,540
If you want to understand the future,
you have to understand physics.

54
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,930
Physics is at the foundation of all the 
Gadgetry,

55
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:35,764
the wizardry,
all the marvels of the technological 

56
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,040
age.
All of it can be traced to the work of a

57
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:42,874
physicist.

58
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,970
Most of science fiction is in fact well 
within the laws of physics,

59
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,103
but possible within maybe 100 years,
and then we have impossibilities that 

60
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:59,260
may take a thousand years or more.
That includes time travel,

61
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,440
warp drive,
higher dimensions,

62
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,970
portals through space and time,
stargates wormholes.

63
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,253
You know,
if you were to meet your great 

64
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:14,080
grandparents of the year 1900,
they were dirt farmers back then.

65
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,830
They didn't live much beyond the age of 
40 on average,

66
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,023
long distance communication in the year 
1900 was yelling at your neighbor and 

67
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:24,334
yet if they could see you now with ipads
and ipods and satellites and gps and 

68
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:32,410
laser beams,
how would they view you?

69
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,130
They will view you as a wizard or 
sourcer.

70
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,533
However,
if we can now meet our grandkids of the 

71
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,200
year 2100,
how would we viewed them?

72
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,800
We would view them as gods like in Greek
mythology.

73
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,100
Zeus could control objects around him by
pure thought,

74
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,260
materialized objects just by thinking 
and their perks being a Greek God.

75
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,190
Venus had a perfect body,
a timeless body,

76
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,203
and we are beginning now to unravel the 
genetics at the molecular level of the 

77
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:11,650
aging process.
And then Apollo.

78
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,680
He had a chariot that he could write 
across the heavens.

79
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,813
We will finally have that flying car 
that we've always wanted to have in our 

80
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:20,920
garage.
By the year 2100,

81
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,300
we will have the power of the gods.
To Paraphrase Arthur,

82
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:26,134
c dot Clarke,
any sufficiently advanced technology is 

83
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:34,651
indistinguishable from divinity.
So let's now begin our story.

84
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,330
The history of physics is the history of
modern civilization.

85
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,810
Before Isaac Newton,
before Galileo,

86
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,070
we were shrouded with the mysteries of 
superstition.

87
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,520
People believed in all sorts of 
different kinds of spirits and demons.

88
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,950
What made the planets move?
Why you do things,

89
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:03,470
interact with other things.
It was a mystery.

90
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,710
So back in the Middle Ages,
for example,

91
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,773
uh,
people read the works of Aristotle and 

92
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:13,760
Aristotle as the question,
why do objects move toward the earth?

93
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,030
And that's because he said,
objects yearn,

94
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,420
yearn to be united with the earth.
And why do object slow down when you put

95
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:27,230
them in motion?
Objects in motion slow down because they

96
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:30,860
get tired.
These are the works of Aristotle,

97
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:31,963
which held sway for almost 2000 years 
until the beginning of modern physics 

98
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,580
with Galileo and Isaac Newton.

99
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,700
When the ancients looked at the sky,
the sky was full of mystery and wonder.

100
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,680
And in the year 10,
66,

101
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,100
the most important date on the British 
calendar,

102
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,323
there was a comment,
a comment would sailed over the 

103
00:06:58,421 --> 00:06:59,254
battlefield of hastings.
It frightened the troops of King Harold 

104
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:03,963
and a young man from Normandy swept into
England and defeated King Harold at the 

105
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:14,650
battle of hastings creating the modern 
British monarchy.

106
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,550
But the question is,
where did the comment come from?

107
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,593
What was this comment that mysteriously 
pave the way for the coming of the 

108
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:26,500
British monarchy?
Well,

109
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:28,930
believe it or not,
that same comment,

110
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:34,530
the very same comment that initiated the
British monarchy sailed over London once

111
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:39,670
again in 16,
82 this time,

112
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,260
everyone was asking the question,
where do comments come from?

113
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,363
Do they signal the death of the king?
Why do we have messengers from the 

114
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:52,060
heavens in the sky?
Well,

115
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:56,020
one man dare to penetrate the secrets of
comments.

116
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,450
And that was Isaac Newton.
In fact,

117
00:07:58,451 --> 00:07:59,284
when Isaac Newton was only 23 years old,
he stumbled upon the universal force of 

118
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:06,940
gravitation.
According to one story,

119
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,880
he was walking on his estate and Wills 
Thorpe,

120
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,073
and he saw an apple fall.
And then Isaac Newton saw the moon and 

121
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:20,821
then he asked the key question which 
help to unlock the heavens if apples

122
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,280
does the moon also fall.
And the answer was yes.

123
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,433
And that answer overturn thousands of 
years of mystery and speculation about 

124
00:08:36,661 --> 00:08:41,640
the emotions of the heavens.
The moon is in free fall,

125
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,103
just like an apple.
The moon is constantly falling toward 

126
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:47,604
the earth.
It doesn't hit the earth because it 

127
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:52,020
spins around the earth and the earth is 
round,

128
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:57,180
but it's acting under a force of force 
of gravity.

129
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:03,000
So Newton immediately try to work out 
the mathematics and he realized that the

130
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:03,834
mathematics of the 16 hundreds was not 
sufficient to work out the motion of 

131
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:09,954
falling moon.
So what did Isaac Newton do when he was 

132
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:13,884
23 years old?
Not only did he stumble upon the force 

133
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:20,550
of gravity,
but he also created calculus.

134
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,000
In fact,
he created calculus at the rate at which

135
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:27,030
you learn it when you're a freshman in 
college.

136
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,280
And why did he create calculus?

137
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,150
To calculate the motion of a falling 
moon?

138
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,463
The mathematics of his age was incapable
of calculating the trajectories of 

139
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:41,010
objects moving under an inverse square 
force field,

140
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,220
and that's what Isaac Newton did.
He worked out the motion of the moon and

141
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:50,190
then he realized that if he understands 
the moon,

142
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,460
he also understands the motion of the 
planets in the solar system,

143
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,300
and Isaac Newton invented a new 
telescope.

144
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,493
It was the reflecting telescope,
and he was tracking the motion of this 

145
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:06,990
comment.
Well,

146
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,930
it turns out that everyone was talking 
about the comment,

147
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:14,931
including a rather wealthy Englishman by
the name of Edmund Halley.

148
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,030
So Edmund Halley being a wealthy 
merchant,

149
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,103
decided to make a trip to Cambridge to 
talk to England's illustrious 

150
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,890
scientists,
Sir Isaac Newton.

151
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,680
Well,
Edmund Halley ask Newton.

152
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,460
What do you make of this comment?
No one understands comments.

153
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,473
There are mystery.
They've been fascinating people for 

154
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:37,650
centuries,
for Millennia.

155
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,470
What are your thoughts?
And then I paraphrase,

156
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,110
but Isaac Newton said something like 
this.

157
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,610
He said,
oh,

158
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,373
that's easy.
That comment is moving in a perfect 

159
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:49,734
ellipse.
It's moving in an in an inverse square 

160
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:52,914
force field.
I've been tracking it every day with my 

161
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,310
reflecting telescope and the path of 
that comment,

162
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,640
conform this to my mathematics.
Exactly,

163
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,380
and of course we don't know what Edmund 
Haley's reaction was by paraphrase.

164
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,790
He must have said something like this.
For God's sake,

165
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,624
man,
why don't you publish the greatest work 

166
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,603
in all of scientific history if correct 
you have decoded the secret of the 

167
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:25,680
stars,
the secret of the heavens.

168
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,380
Nobody understands where comments come 
from,

169
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,170
and then Newton responded and said,
oh,

170
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:33,480
well,
it cost too much.

171
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,760
I mean,
I'm not a wealthy man.

172
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,743
It would cost too much to summarize this
calculus that I've invented and to work 

173
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:44,250
out all the motion of the stars,
and then Haley must have said this,

174
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,520
Mr Newton,
I am a wealthy man.

175
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,253
I have made my fortune in commerce.
I will pay for the publication of the 

176
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:57,910
greatest scientific work in any 
language,

177
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,620
and it was praying Kimbia the 
principles,

178
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,680
the mathematical principles that guide 
the heavens.

179
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,083
Believe it or not,
this is perhaps one of the most 

180
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:09,874
important works ever written by a human 
being in the hundred thousand years 

181
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,683
since we evolved from Africa.
Realize that this book sets into motion 

182
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,653
of physics of the universe,
forces that control the motion of the 

183
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:28,384
planets,
forces which can be calculated forces 

184
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,860
which govern the motion of cannon balls,
rockets,

185
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,920
pebbles,
everything that moves,

186
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,220
moves according to the laws of motion 
and the calculus of Sir Isaac Newton.

187
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,053
In fact,
even today when we launch our space 

188
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:50,950
probes,
we don't use Einstein's equations.

189
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,520
They only apply when you get near the 
speed of light or near a black hole.

190
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,730
We use Newton's laws of gravity.
They are so precise that when we shoot a

191
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:02,740
space probe right past the rings of 
Saturn,

192
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,903
we use exactly the same equations that 
Isaac Newton unrivaled in the 16 

193
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:09,754
hundreds.

194
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,593
That's why being able to unravel the 
secrets of the solar system complements 

195
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:15,214
of the laws of motion of Isaac Newton.
So what Newton did was not only did he 

196
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:24,280
set into motion the ability to calculate
planets,

197
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,383
he also set into motion a mechanic's 
machines now operated upon well defined 

198
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,190
laws.
Newton's three laws of motion.

199
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,550
The first law of motion says that 
objects in motion stay in motion forever

200
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,870
unless acted upon by an outside force.
You see that in an ice skating rink,

201
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,250
you shoot the puck and it goes all the 
way down forever,

202
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,320
unless acted upon by an outside force.
That's different from Aristotle's law of

203
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:57,154
motion.
Aristotle said objects in motion 

204
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,413
eventually stop because they get tired.
The second law of Motion Says Force is 

205
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:07,444
mass times acceleration,
and that equation made possible the 

206
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:11,970
industrial

207
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,060
revolution,
steam,

208
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,410
locomotives,
factories,

209
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,340
machines,
all of it,

210
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:24,341
dude to the mechanics set into motion by
Isaac Newton's second law of motion for

211
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:25,963
us as equal to mass times acceleration.
And then Newton had a third law of 

212
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:29,834
motion.
For every action there's an equal and 

213
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:34,970
opposite reaction.
That's a law of rockets.

214
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,060
That's what we have rockets that can 
assailant the artist space.

215
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,133
So the lesson here is when scientists 
unraveled the first force of the 

216
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:47,810
universe,
gravity that set into motion,

217
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:48,763
the industrial revolution,
a which toppled the kings and Queens of 

218
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:55,850
Europe,
which this place feudalism,

219
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:56,923
ushering in the modern age,
all because a 23 year old gentleman 

220
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,880
looked up and asked the question,
does the moon also fall?

221
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:09,883
You know,
when I was a kid growing up in 

222
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:13,160
California,
I would see pictures of the empire state

223
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:17,510
building and I said to myself,
how could they possibly build such a big

224
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:20,600
building and not know that it's going to
fall?

225
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,063
Why doesn't it far?
They didn't build scale models of the 

226
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:25,184
thing.
You couldn't have an empire state 

227
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:27,014
building that big that tests whether 
it's going to fall in on how did they 

228
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:33,890
know ahead of time that that building 
wouldn't fall,

229
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,160
and the answer is Newton's laws of 
motion.

230
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,233
In fact,
today I teach Newton's laws of motion 

231
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,993
and you can actually calculate the 
forces on every single brick of the 

232
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:50,801
empire state building using Newton's 
second law of Motion Force is mass times

233
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,124
acceleration

234
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,000
where Newton unraveled the force of 
gravity.

235
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,960
That was the first force.
Now let's take a look at it,

236
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:01,430
a second force,
and even greater for us,

237
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,580
which has touched all of our lives,
and that is the electro magnetic force.

238
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,153
Ever since humans saw lightening bolts 
light up the sky every since they were 

239
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:17,300
terrified by the sound of thunder 
they've been asking,

240
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,290
do the gods propelled lightning bolts 
and create funder?

241
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,213
Are they angry at us?
Scientists began to realize that the 

242
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:31,220
lightening bolts and the funder can be 
duplicated on the earth,

243
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,540
that we can actually create many 
lightening bolts using electricity,

244
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,350
but it wasn't until the 18 hundreds that
finally began to unlock the second great

245
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,450
forest,
which rules the universe,

246
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,613
the electromagnetic force,
Michael Faraday would give Christmas 

247
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:49,874
lectures in London.
Fascinating everyone from adults to 

248
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:57,671
children and he would demonstrate the 
incredible properties of electricity.

249
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,960
Some people,
for example,

250
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:02,960
ask a simple question,
if you're in a car or an airplane,

251
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:06,070
you get hit by lightening bolt.
Why don't you all get electrocuted?

252
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,420
Why don't you all die?
Well,

253
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:12,230
fair to answer the question.
He would create a cage.

254
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,710
He would walk into the steel cage,
electrify it,

255
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,660
and he wouldn't get electrocuted at all.
That's called a faraday cage,

256
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,450
and every time you walk into a middle 
structure,

257
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:27,230
you get shielded by this metal object.
Well,

258
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:28,064
but Michael Faraday did.
Was he helped to unleash the second 

259
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:35,750
great revolution with something called 
Faraday's law?

260
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,770
I'm moving wire in a magnetic field.
Has this electrons pushed,

261
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,093
creating an electrical current.
That simple idea unleashed the electric 

262
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:51,354
revolution,
and that's why we have hydroelectric 

263
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,440
generators.
Damn,

264
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,510
that can produce enormous amounts of 
power.

265
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,120
That's why people build nuclear power 
plants.

266
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,360
That's why we have electricity in this 
room right now on a very small scale.

267
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,233
You use that in your bicycle.
When you put a bicycle lamp on your 

268
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:12,300
bicycle,
the turning of the wheel spins a magnet.

269
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,110
The magnet then pushes electrons in a 
wire,

270
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,410
and that's why electricity lights up in 
your bicycle land.

271
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,753
So in other words,
electricity and magnetism where unified 

272
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,283
into a single virus.
We once thought that electricity and 

273
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:28,614
magnetism were separate.
Now we know they are in fact the same 

274
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,990
force.
So if I'm moving magnet,

275
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,483
then create an electric field.
This means that a moving electric field 

276
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,460
couldn't create a magnetic field,
but if they can create each other,

277
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,533
why can't they oscillate and create a 
wave so that moving electric fields 

278
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:56,850
create magnetic fields,
create electric fields,

279
00:18:56,851 --> 00:19:00,570
create magnetic fields in an item to 
create a wave?

280
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,823
Well,
around the time of the American civil 

281
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:04,104
war,
a mathematical physicist James Clerk 

282
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,583
Maxwell calculated using the work of 
Farah day the velocity of this wave and 

283
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:15,000
one of the greatest breakthroughs of all
time.

284
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,643
James Clerk Maxwell calculated the 
velocity of this wave and found out it 

285
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:21,264
was the velocity of light,
and then he made this incredible 

286
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,440
discovery.
This is light.

287
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,563
That's what light is.
It doesn't by accident travel at the 

288
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:38,484
speed of electricity,
it is light itself and the equations 

289
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,330
were written down by James Clerk 
Maxwell.

290
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,373
Unfortunately,
Michael Farady himself did not have a 

291
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,104
formal education.
He could not put it into mathematical 

292
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,860
form,
his own work.

293
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,150
James Clerk Maxwell was a theoretical 
physicist like myself.

294
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,193
He wrote down the mathematical physics 
of oscillating electric fields and 

295
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:02,814
magnetic fields,
and they are a called Maxwell's 

296
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:05,844
equations.
These equations have to be memorized by 

297
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,923
every physicist in Grad school.
You cannot get your phd without 

298
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:14,904
memorizing these equations.
Every engineer who deals with radar and 

299
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:22,530
radio has to memorize these equations,
and so if you go to Berkeley where I got

300
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:23,364
my phd,
you can buy a t shirt which says in the 

301
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:27,234
beginning God said the four dimensional 
divergence of an anti symmetric second 

302
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:34,950
rank tensor equals zero.
And there was like,

303
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,530
ladies and gentlemen,
this is the equation for light.

304
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:48,400
The consequences of the electromagnetic 
revolution touch all of us.

305
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,710
This is a picture of the earth from 
outer space.

306
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,070
Look at this picture,
Europe electrified.

307
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,370
You can actually see the fruits of all 
of our efforts to create electricity,

308
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:04,741
to energize our lives in one picture.
Seeing the earth from outer space.

309
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,430
So let's now talk about how faraday and 
Maxwell is,

310
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:13,660
where it touches your life as well.
This is the Internet.

311
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,943
The Internet is a simple byproduct of 
the electromagnetic force and you can 

312
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:21,040
see that where there is the internet,
there's prosperity,

313
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,250
there is science,
there's entertainment,

314
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,130
there's economic activity where there's 
no internet,

315
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,353
there's poverty,
and in the future the Urjanet will be 

316
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:34,750
miniaturized and it'll be placed in your
glasses.

317
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,973
Your glasses will recognize people's 
faces and display their biography next 

318
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:44,350
to the image as you talked to them,
and then when they speak Chinese to you,

319
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,333
your glasses will translate Chinese into
English and out subtitles right beneath 

320
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:51,484
their image.

321
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,443
So in the future you will know exactly 
who you are talking to without even 

322
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,160
talking to them.
And this means that at a cocktail party,

323
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,293
if you're looking for a job but you 
don't know who the heavy hitters are in 

324
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:04,924
the future,
you will know exactly who to suck up to 

325
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,140
in the future.
At chips,

326
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:09,974
all in cost a penny because we can 
manufacture a tinier and tinier 

327
00:22:13,841 --> 00:22:16,930
transistors.
You will have ferritin's electromagnetic

328
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:20,590
forest inside your body.
This is a pill,

329
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,023
it has a chip in it.
The chip is smaller than an aspirin 

330
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:27,700
pill.
It also has a TV camera and a magnet.

331
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,893
When you swallow it,
the magnet guides the camera taking 

332
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:34,780
pictures of your stomach,
your intestines,

333
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,590
because we all know what middle aged men
feared the most colonoscopies,

334
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:43,960
and this gives new meaning for the 
expression Intel inside.

335
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,903
Now,
let's talk about the next great forces 

336
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:52,700
which ruled the universe.
We talked about gravity,

337
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,640
which allows us to calculate the motion 
of the planets,

338
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:00,710
the mechanics created by Newton help to 
unleash the industrial revolution.

339
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,010
Michael Faraday worked out the 
electromagnetic force,

340
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,100
which gave us the wonders of the 
electric age,

341
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:10,000
and now let's talk about the nuclear 
age.

342
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:15,550
The stars and the Sun.
People have been fascinated by the sun.

343
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,320
Apollo was the God that strode across 
the heavens and his fiery chariot,

344
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,543
but hey,
when you calculate how long coal or oil 

345
00:23:26,661 --> 00:23:27,494
will burn like the sun,
you realize that and just a few hundred 

346
00:23:29,931 --> 00:23:32,450
years,
the sun would burn to a Chris.

347
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,200
So what could possibly last for billions
of years?

348
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:40,640
There must be a new force on nuclear 
forests.

349
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,900
Einstein and others helped to unravel 
the secrets of the stars.

350
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,290
The nuclear forest comes in two types,
weak and strong.

351
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,040
The weak nuclear force governs 
radioactive decay.

352
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,410
The strong nuclear force is one of the 
strongest forces in the entire universe.

353
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,880
It's so strong.
It holds our protons together ever since

354
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,773
genesis the beginning of time.
The equation which allows for the 

355
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:14,921
liberation of energy is Einstein's 
famous equation e equals MC squared.

356
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,240
What Einstein showed was that the faster
you move,

357
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,410
the heavier you get,
so your weight is not a constant.

358
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,200
When you move very rapidly,
you get heavier.

359
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,660
Something which we measure every day in 
the laboratory.

360
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,853
Now this means that the energy of motion
transformed into mass because you get 

361
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,520
heavier.
Now listen carefully.

362
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:45,200
The faster you move,
the heavier you get,

363
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:50,180
which means the energy of motion.
He turns into Em.

364
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,890
Your mass and the relationship between 
Enm is assembled.

365
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,440
It takes one second to write it down on 
a sheet of paper.

366
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:02,670
It is exactly e equals Mc Square,
so the nuclear forests helped to explain

367
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:05,924
the secret of the sun,
but it also created a Pandora's box 

368
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,693
because inside the nucleus of the Adam 
are particles and when you smash these 

369
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,720
particles,
what do you get?

370
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,070
More particles and when you smash them,
when do you get more particles?

371
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,240
In fact,
we are drowning in subatomic particles.

372
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,780
Hundreds,
thousands of subatomic particles.

373
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,823
Every time we smash atoms,
now we smash atoms using something 

374
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:37,220
called Atom smashers or particle 
accelerators.

375
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,760
I built my own particle accelerator when
I was in high school.

376
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,390
When I was in high school.
I went to my mom one day and I said,

377
00:25:44,391 --> 00:25:45,224
mom,
can I have permission to build a two 

378
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:47,864
point $3,
billion electron volt Beta particle 

379
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,330
accelerator in the garage?
And my mom said,

380
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,730
sure,
why not?

381
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,590
And don't forget to take out the 
garbage.

382
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:58,963
So I went to Westinghouse and as a high 
school kid I asked for 400 pounds of 

383
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:03,404
transformers steel.
I asked for 22 miles of copper wire 

384
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,480
because I wanted to create a six 
kilowatt,

385
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,343
10,000
gas magnetic field to energize my atom 

386
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:13,850
smasher with 22 miles of copper wire.

387
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,683
How could you wind it?
We did it on the high school football 

388
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:17,414
field.
I put 22 miles of copper wire and the 

389
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:23,930
goalpost gave it to my mother.
She ran to the 50 yard line,

390
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,460
unraveling the spool of wire.
She gave it to my father who then ran to

391
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,294
the goalpost and we wound 22 miles of 
copper wire on the high school football 

392
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:34,280
field.
Well,

393
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:38,900
finally my atom smasher was ready.
It can sub six kilowatts of power.

394
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:42,830
That's every single ounce of power that 
my house could deliver.

395
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,730
I plug my ears,
I close my eyes.

396
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:52,731
I turned on the power and I heard this 
huge crackling sound as six kilowatts of

397
00:26:53,671 --> 00:26:58,650
power surge through my capacitor bank.
And then I heard a pop pop,

398
00:26:58,651 --> 00:26:59,484
pop sound.
As I blew out every single circuit 

399
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:06,150
breaker in the house,
the whole house was plunged in darkness.

400
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:07,823
My poor mom,
every time she come home she would see 

401
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:14,130
the lights flicker and die and she must 
have wondered,

402
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,670
why couldn't I have a son who plays 
baseball?

403
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,120
Why can't he learn basketball and for 
God's sake,

404
00:27:21,121 --> 00:27:23,430
why can't you find a nice Japanese girl?
I mean,

405
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:27,480
why does he have to build these machines
in the garage?

406
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,110
Well,
these machines that I built in my garage

407
00:27:31,111 --> 00:27:34,560
earn the attention of a physicist,
Edward Teller,

408
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,573
father of the hydrogen bomb,
and he arranged for me to get a 

409
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:42,090
scholarship to Harvard and my career got
a headstart.

410
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,193
He knew exactly what I was doing.
I didn't have to explain to him that I 

411
00:27:46,951 --> 00:27:47,784
was experimenting with anti matter.
I was creating anti electrons and my 

412
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:52,134
mom's garage and using atis measures to 
eventually create beams of anti matter 

413
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,200
and matter is the opposite of matter.
It has the opposite charge,

414
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,273
so an electron has negative charge.
The positron or anti electron has 

415
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:06,774
positive charge.
This means that you cannot create anti 

416
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:14,580
molecules and anti Adams,
anti hydrogen was made at Cern,

417
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,960
outside Geneva,
Switzerland,

418
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,003
and also at fermilab outside Chicago 
where have anti electrons circulating 

419
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:25,410
around antiprotons and in Brookhaven 
national laboratory,

420
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:26,790
Long Island.
Just recently,

421
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,953
they detected anti helium.
We have two antiprotons with two anti 

422
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:37,560
neutrons to create anti helium for every
piece of matter.

423
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,530
There's a counterpart which is made out 
of antiemetic,

424
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,510
and when the two collide,
by the way,

425
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,650
that releases the greatest energy source
in the universe,

426
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:52,540
it is 100 percent conversion of matter 
to energy by Einstein's equations.

427
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,480
E equals MC squared.

428
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,033
Inside the nucleus of the atom,
we have particles upon particles when 

429
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:05,820
you smashed them apart.
The 19 fifties,

430
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,900
we were drowning in subatomic particles.
In fact,

431
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,720
J dot Robert Oppenheimer,
the father of the atomic bomb,

432
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:13,823
once made a statement,
he declared that the Nobel Prize in 

433
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:19,734
physics should go to the physicist who 
does not discover a new particle this 

434
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,380
year.

435
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,330
That's how many particles were being 
discovered.

436
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,190
So let's talk about the particles zoo.

437
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:37,170
Right now we've physicists have unlocked
hundreds,

438
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,003
thousands of subatomic particles,
and we've been able to piece them 

439
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:41,364
together.
A jigsaw puzzle is called the standard 

440
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:46,450
model.
It has 36 quarks,

441
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,890
19 free parameters,
three generations of Clarks,

442
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,110
no rhyme,
no reason,

443
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:58,290
but this is the most fundamental basis 
of reality that we've.

444
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,040
Businesses have been able to construct 
billions of dollars,

445
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:08,190
20 Nobel prizes have gone into the 
creation of the standard model and it is

446
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:13,270
the ugliest theory known to science,
but it works.

447
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,160
There's one piece missing and that one 
piece that's missing is called the Higgs

448
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,200
Boson.
We expect to find it.

449
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:21,603
We want to create a higher version of 
this theory and that theory we think is 

450
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:28,564
string theory.
String theory is based on the simple 

451
00:30:31,211 --> 00:30:35,710
idea that all the four forces of the 
universe,

452
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:38,650
gravity,
electromagnetic force,

453
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,730
and the two nuclear forces can be viewed
as music.

454
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,613
Music of tiny little rubber bands.
So if I had a supermarket scope and I 

455
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:51,670
could look right into the heart of an 
electron,

456
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:52,863
what would I see?
I would see a vibrating rubber band and 

457
00:30:55,481 --> 00:30:57,490
if I trying it,
it turns into a neutrino.

458
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,700
I trying it again,
it turns into a court I trying and again

459
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:02,920
turns into a Yang Mills particle.
In fact,

460
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,873
by playing it enough times,
I get thousands of subatomic particles 

461
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:11,650
that have been catalog patiently by 
businesses.

462
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,793
String theory we think is a theory of 
everything now in string theory in turn 

463
00:31:19,931 --> 00:31:23,320
can be summarized in an equation about 
an inch long.

464
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,873
That's my equation.
This is called string field theory and 

465
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:31,960
how will we test it?
We are building a machine,

466
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,573
the biggest machine of science ever 
built in the history of the human race 

467
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,480
outside Geneva,
Switzerland.

468
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:46,050
It is the large Hadron collider.
Some of the Higgs Boson we think will be

469
00:31:48,101 --> 00:31:52,120
created by the large hadron collider,
a tube 17 miles.

470
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:52,973
It's a conference with two beams of 
protons circulating in opposite 

471
00:31:55,691 --> 00:31:58,630
directions,
then slamming together,

472
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,913
creating a shower of particles and among
these particles we hope to find the 

473
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,680
expose on,
but not only that,

474
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,023
we helped to find particles even beyond 
the higgs on the next set of particles 

475
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:11,494
beyond the higgs on our spa articles.
The next layer of the jigsaw puzzle are 

476
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:17,500
called particles.
Super particles,

477
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,873
nothing but higher vibrations,
higher musical notes of a vibrating 

478
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:24,580
string,
and what else could we do?

479
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,850
We can also unlock the secrets of the 
Big Bang.

480
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,403
You see Einstein's equations breakdown 
at the instant of the Big Bang and the 

481
00:32:33,731 --> 00:32:34,564
center of a black hole.
The two most interesting places in the 

482
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:42,721
universe are beyond our reach.
Using Einstein's equations.

483
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,420
We need a higher theory and that's where
a string theory comes in.

484
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,840
String theory takes you before the big 
bang before genesis itself,

485
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,823
and what is string theory?
Say it says that there is a multiverse 

486
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:00,830
of universities.

487
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,830
Where did the Big Bang come from?
Well,

488
00:33:04,831 --> 00:33:05,664
Einstein's equations give us this 
compelling picture that we are like 

489
00:33:10,381 --> 00:33:13,960
insects on a soap bubble as gigantic 
softball,

490
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,600
which is expanding and we are trapped 
like flies on flypaper.

491
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:22,140
We can escape the soap bubble and that's
called the Big Bang theory.

492
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,113
String theory says there should be other
bubbles out there in a multiverse of 

493
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:32,700
bubbles.
When to universities collide,

494
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:38,220
it can form another universe.
When the universe splits in half,

495
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,290
it can create two universes and that we 
think is the big bang.

496
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:44,903
The Big Bang is caused either by the 
collision of universes or by the 

497
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,010
visioning of universities.

498
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,910
If there are other dimensions,
if there are other universes,

499
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,810
can we go between universes?
Well,

500
00:34:00,811 --> 00:34:03,240
that of course is very hard.
However,

501
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,123
ours at wonderland gives us a 
possibility that maybe one day we might 

502
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:10,194
create a wormhole between universities.
This is a wormhole think of taking a 

503
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:20,280
sheet of paper and putting two dots on 
it.

504
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:24,060
The shortest distance between two points
is a straight line,

505
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:28,620
but if I can fold,
if I can follow that sheet of paper,

506
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:34,550
then perhaps I can create a shortcut,
a shortcut through space and time called

507
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:39,120
a wormhole.
This is a genuine solution of Einstein's

508
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:39,954
equations.
We can actually see this in string 

509
00:34:42,061 --> 00:34:42,894
theory.
The question is how practical is it to 

510
00:34:45,931 --> 00:34:48,810
go through one of these things we don't 
know.

511
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,330
In fact,
there's a debate among businesses today,

512
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,403
Stephen Hawking,
many physicists are jumping into the 

513
00:34:54,061 --> 00:34:54,894
game of trying to figure out whether 
it's physically possible to go all the 

514
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:00,564
way through a wormhole,
because if you could then you might be 

515
00:35:06,211 --> 00:35:07,044
able to use this as a time machine.
So the string theory is a theory of 

516
00:35:10,801 --> 00:35:14,690
everything.
It's also a theory of time and time.

517
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:17,370
Machines are allowed in Einstein's 
equations,

518
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,593
but to build one is extremely difficult.
Far more energy is required than a 

519
00:35:25,231 --> 00:35:27,300
simple Delorean with potassium.

520
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,840
You know,
trillions of years from now,

521
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,880
the universe is going to get awfully 
cold.

522
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,700
We think the universe headed for a big 
freeze.

523
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:43,200
All the stars will blank out.
Stars will cease to twinkle.

524
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,960
The universe will be so big,
it will be very cold.

525
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,003
At that point,
all intelligent life in the universe 

526
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,323
must die.

527
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:58,250
The laws of physics or a death warrant 
to all intelligent life.

528
00:35:59,130 --> 00:35:59,963
There's only one way to escape the death
of the universe and that is leave the 

529
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:06,324
universe.
We are now of course entering the realm 

530
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:11,670
of science fiction,
but at least we now have equations.

531
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,743
The equations of string theory,
which will allow us to calculate if it 

532
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:21,021
is possible to go through a wormhole to 
go to another universe where it's warmer

533
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,913
and perhaps we can start all over again.
If you were to summarize the march of 

534
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:33,660
physics over the last 10,000
years,

535
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,440
it would be the distillation of the laws
of nature into four fundamental forces,

536
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,930
gravity,
electricity and magnetism,

537
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,840
and the two nuclear forces,
but then the question is,

538
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:46,674
is there a fifth force,
a forest beyond the forces that we can 

539
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:53,070
measure in the laboratory,
and believe it or not,

540
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,933
there are physicists who have actually 
looked very carefully for the fifth 

541
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:57,144
force.

542
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,760
Some people think maybe it's psychic 
phenomenon,

543
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:04,050
maybe it's telepathy,
maybe it's something called power.

544
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,870
Maybe it's the power of the mind may be 
consciousness.

545
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,460
Well,
I'm a physicist.

546
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,743
We believe in testing theories to make 
sure that they are falsifiable and 

547
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,840
reproducible.
We want to make sure that on demand,

548
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,290
your theory works every single time 
without exception,

549
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:26,370
and if your theory fails one time,
it's wrong.

550
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,110
In other words,
Einstein's theory,

551
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:33,111
half's has to work every single time 
without exception one time.

552
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,230
Einstein's theory is proven to be wrong.
The whole theory is wrong.

553
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,543
Well,
so far we can reproduce these four 

554
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:40,854
physical theories,
but at fifth theory cannot be 

555
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:45,600
reproduced.
We've looked for it.

556
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,703
Some people think that maybe a fifth for
is maybe short range like not over the 

557
00:37:50,131 --> 00:37:50,964
nucleus of the atom,
but ranging over several feet and we 

558
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:55,044
can't find any.

559
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:58,743
We physicists in the last 10 years I've 
discovered a new energy source larger 

560
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,073
than the galaxy itself.
Dark energy realized that our universe 

561
00:38:09,431 --> 00:38:12,820
today,
73 percent of our universe,

562
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:13,683
the matter energy,
73 percent is in the form of dark 

563
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,580
energy,
the energy of nothing.

564
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:22,150
That's what's blowing the galaxies 
farther and farther apart.

565
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:25,720
That's the energy of the Big Bang 
itself.

566
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,840
Kids asked the question,
if the universe banged that,

567
00:38:28,841 --> 00:38:31,900
what made it bang?
And the answer is dark energy.

568
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,830
Seventy three percent of the universe is
energy is energy.

569
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:40,000
Twenty three percent is dark matter.
Dark matter is invisible matter.

570
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,520
If I held it in my hand,
it would go right through my hand.

571
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,653
It holds the galaxy together.
Twenty three percent of the universe is 

572
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:47,674
dark matter.
Stars made out of hydrogen and helium 

573
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,190
make up four percent of the universe,
and then what about us?

574
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,330
We the higher elements we made out of 
oxygen,

575
00:38:58,331 --> 00:38:59,650
carbon,
nitrogen,

576
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,860
constant iron.
We make a point,

577
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,580
oh,
three percent of the universe.

578
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,700
In other words,
we are the exception.

579
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,180
The universe is mainly made out of dark 
energy.

580
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,880
The universe is mainly made out of dark 
matter.

581
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,270
Overwhelming the stars,
overwhelming the galaxies.

582
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:20,104
In fact,
now what is dark matter which makes up 

583
00:39:22,391 --> 00:39:26,770
23 percent of the universe.
No one knows.

584
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,820
String theory gives us a clue,
but there's no definitive answer.

585
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,453
So in other words,
for you young aspiring businesses out 

586
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:40,730
there in the audience,
you may be saying to yourself right now,

587
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:41,743
why should I go into physics?
Because you guys already have a 

588
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,980
candidate for the unified field theory,
right?

589
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,520
Just realize that every single physics 
textbook is wrong.

590
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,293
Every single physics textbook on the 
Earth says that the universe is mainly 

591
00:39:55,731 --> 00:39:57,230
made out of atoms,
right?

592
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:00,200
There it is.
The universe is mainly made out of atoms

593
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,213
wrong,
and the last 10 years we have come to 

594
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:04,364
the realization that most of the 
universe is dark and there's a whole 

595
00:40:08,811 --> 00:40:09,644
shelf full of Nobel prizes for the young
people who can figure out the secret of 

596
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,470
dark matter and dark energy.

597
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:23,980
Let me get some advice to you.
If you are a young physicist,

598
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:27,460
perhaps just getting out of high school,
you have dreams of being.

599
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:31,540
Einstein have dreams of working on 
string theory and stuff like that,

600
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,020
and then you hit freshman physics.
Let me be blunt.

601
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,663
We physicists flunk.
Most students taking elementary physics 

602
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:43,420
and we're more or less encouraged to do 
so by the engineering department.

603
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,710
We don't want to train engineers who 
make bridges that fall down.

604
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:51,550
We don't want to create engineers that 
create skyscrapers that fall over.

605
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:55,690
There's a bottom line.
You have to know the laws of mechanics,

606
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:58,060
so before you can work with the laws of 
Einstein,

607
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,100
you have to look with the laws of 
friction,

608
00:41:00,101 --> 00:41:01,300
levers,
pulleys,

609
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:03,490
and gears.
As a consequence,

610
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:06,130
we have a very high flood God right in 
elementary physics,

611
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,143
so if you're a young physicist 
graduating from high school with stars 

612
00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:13,810
in your eyes and you encounter freshmen 
physics for the first time,

613
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:17,950
watch out if you have a rough time.
That's the way it is.

614
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:22,420
I started out my life as an experimental
physicist.

615
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,750
Then I went to Harvard and then I talked
to my advisor,

616
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,240
one of the world's greatest experimental
physicist,

617
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,103
professor pound,
and he told me that maybe it's time to 

618
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:33,740
give it a rest.
He said to me,

619
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,610
your skills are much better suited to 
what you love the most,

620
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,010
which is theory,
mathematics,

621
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,873
the world of higher dimensions,
and I realized that he was probably 

622
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:44,774
right.
The thing about physics or even science 

623
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:48,644
that really intrigues me the most is to 
find the most fundamental basis for 

624
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:53,924
everything.
Rather than trying to massage a theory 

625
00:41:56,421 --> 00:42:00,230
or make a theory prettier,
why not find out why it works,

626
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:03,140
what makes it tick,
and so what I do for a living,

627
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,050
I'm a theoretical physicist.
Thank you very much.
