1
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,500
Korea,
Brown cofounder,

2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:16,340
big thing.
I originally from Toronto and I actually

3
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:20,390
don't think that it shaped me too much.
I think my parents shaped me more than

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,060
where I'm from.
My parents are,

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,880
uh,
one is our Schwann is American.

6
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:30,590
And so we were always,
none of us were Canadians growing up in

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,110
Canada.
And so we always were a little bit of

8
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:36,200
outsiders and so we kind of have that
mentality I think.

9
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,943
No,

10
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,783
sure.
My,

11
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,030
my family is pretty creative and both my
siblings are actors and my sister is

12
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:54,420
also a writer,
so it's kind of been in the blood and I

13
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,730
knew I wanted to do it from,
you know,

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,010
a long time.
It was just a question of having the

15
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:04,011
courage to kind of go and move to La and
start as an unpaid intern and a waitress

16
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:06,600
and that type of thing.
So,

17
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,460
um,
I mean I,

18
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,200
I've just kind of known that I wanted to
do it.

19
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:14,580
I can't think of as precise event that's
told me this is what you will do that,

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,110
um,
well,

21
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:22,530
you know,
what

22
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,480
it did was sort of not about business.
I wanted to do something

23
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:30,300
entrepreneurial.
And I had wanted to work in the

24
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:34,530
entertainment and media field.
And so after I graduated from

25
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,010
university,
I moved to France for a year.

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,200
And while I was there I decided,
you know,

27
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:43,500
I'm really interested in film and
Television and that type of thing.

28
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,800
So I moved back to Toronto very briefly
before moving to Los Angeles to work in

29
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:52,080
film.
And so while I was there,

30
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:52,860
I thought,
you know,

31
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,400
I don't really want one to work my way
up the studio system.

32
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,570
I'd actually like to be running things
and creating things and having creative

33
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:04,590
say and what I'm doing.
And so I realized that all too often,

34
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,830
creative people don't really understand
that what they're doing is also a

35
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:10,950
business.
And so they kind of need to be trained

36
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:14,760
in that way to operate on the same level
as the business people.

37
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:18,840
And so I figured I better get some
training in business and so went to

38
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:21,450
business school.
But it wasn't because I really wanted to

39
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:24,510
be a business person,
it's just that I wanted to understand

40
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,840
what business people did so that I could
participate.

41
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,160
Okay.
