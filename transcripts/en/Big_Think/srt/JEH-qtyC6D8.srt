1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
Okay.

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,013
Yeah.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,280
The thing is we have multiple goals,
right?

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,840
So on the question of stability,
democracy is in really good shape.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:15,980
Uh,
in fact,

6
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:18,650
I would say that in the 2000 election
cycle,

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,570
um,
one of the things that really got

8
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:25,571
celebrated when George Bush and Al Gore
were running for president,

9
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:28,850
they get this quirky result.
Everyone's fighting it out over the

10
00:00:28,851 --> 00:00:32,090
hanging chads in Florida.
Of all the things that I worry about,

11
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:33,650
who won the election for,
you know,

12
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:37,460
a couple of months and,
and that we came out of that process and

13
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:40,490
we ended up with a precedent.
There was no military coup,

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,270
there was no huge set of demonstrations.
And for many people,

15
00:00:44,271 --> 00:00:47,630
this constituted a success,
a win for democracy,

16
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,530
that we are a country that is so stable,
so rule of law,

17
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:54,410
so willing to wait for the process to
work.

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,680
Then in fact,
we can have stable transitions of

19
00:00:57,681 --> 00:01:01,490
leadership even when things are looking
kind of rough.

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,400
So on the one hand,
one might say,

21
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:05,420
well,
democracy is great.

22
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,500
We're,
we're quite stable.

23
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,760
But I think that the story of the 2000
elections could be told another way as

24
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:12,770
well.
There was no military coup.

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,660
There was no outright uprising in the
streets.

26
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:15,411
Right.
In other words,

27
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:19,670
all the things that that one might have
celebrated as being about stability,

28
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,760
one might also suggest,
uh,

29
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,460
reflects a lack of robustness,
a lack of engagement,

30
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,630
um,
a willingness to defer to authority and

31
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,720
to rule of law,
even if in fact it gives us outcomes

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,170
that have terrible consequences for
decades to come.

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,740
So I think,
I think it does depend on sort of how

34
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:43,460
one might measure or judge the value or
quality of democracy.

35
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,830
On the one hand,
a great deal of stability,

36
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,740
on the other hand,
a great deal of violence on the part of

37
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,070
ordinary people,
sort of an inability to really penetrate

38
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:56,690
the elites and to really demonstrate and
discuss what the central issues facing

39
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,670
sort of ordinary Americans are.
