1
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,950
It just,
and you ask a related question about

2
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:13,840
Elon Musk.
Yeah,

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,830
there've been wonderful things that he's
been talking about.

4
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:18,200
Colonizing Mars,
obviously putting a a,

5
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:20,290
a tesla and space,
which is playing David Bowie,

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,030
which I love.
He's a really wonderful person and an

7
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:26,660
inspiration to a lot of us.
And what are the misconceptions a lot of

8
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:31,010
people have is that federal space
programs like NASA and commercial space

9
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:34,220
programs like space x run by Elon Musk
are in some type of a,

10
00:00:34,221 --> 00:00:35,120
uh,
competition.

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,343
And uh,
you know,

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,190
I am a fan of all things space and one
of the things that has been so fun for

13
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:43,820
me in the last few years is the
collaboration between those two

14
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:46,520
different realms of space travel.
So,

15
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:47,450
you know,
for example,

16
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:52,100
a NASA routinely buys space six rockets
to put our payloads and our satellites

17
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:55,040
up into space.
And that means that as a NASA scientist,

18
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:59,390
I've gotten to go to several launches
and landings of these Falcon rockets.

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,740
And that's amazing.
You know,

20
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:04,130
used to be that you would go to a launch
and a big rocket would go off and

21
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,620
everybody would cheer.
And then you get in your cars and you

22
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:10,850
drive home and it was all done.
The amazing thing now is seven minutes

23
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:13,190
later,
everybody just walks to the other side

24
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:15,800
of the building and watches the first
stage of that rocket land.

25
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,360
And that is something that is mind
blowing your eyes basically.

26
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,330
It does not compute.
You cannot believe what you were seeing

27
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,310
because this giant thing comes down from
space faster than you could imagine.

28
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,190
And this is something that's done.
You'll several story high building.

29
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:35,510
It's a big thing.
It comes careening down and just before

30
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:37,750
it gets to the ground,
it's stops,

31
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,810
settles down and then gently lands.
And one of the things that I love is

32
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:45,560
that you don't even hear the sonic boom
until after you see it land.

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,240
You watched this thing come careening
down than stop land gently and then you

34
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:51,230
hear boom,
boom,

35
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,090
because it broke the speed of sound
coming in.

36
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,540
And that is something that I am just
really amazed.

37
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,680
I live to be able to see.
I love space x and I love NASA is

38
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:03,230
collaboration.
I think what a lot of people don't

39
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:06,920
realize that NASA is one of space x as
major customers.

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,040
We actually buy the rockets and we've
even paid for some of the development of

41
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,280
the rockets as well.
So it was never a question of one or the

42
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:13,971
other.
It was a,

43
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:16,010
it was the idea is that we're
collaborating.

44
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,470
The more companies going into space,
hey,

45
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,260
the better for us.
The lower the cost of the rockets and

46
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:25,160
the more efficient an industry we have
and hopefully the more people that think

47
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:27,290
space,
travel and space exploration or good

48
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,124
things.

49
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,760
Then there are the questions about
whether Ilan is going to build a giant

50
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:35,450
rocket that can take hundreds of people
to Mars and then this is something that

51
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:36,410
as a scientist,
you know,

52
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:40,550
I am naturally a skeptical person.
That's how I was trained right now.

53
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:42,920
What I see is a really cool idea,
you know,

54
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:45,410
reminds me of a lot of my favorite
science fiction stories,

55
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,650
but it's basically just that an idea.
I think there's a long way to go before

56
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:54,140
we actually see any significant
colonization.

57
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,090
You know,
any significant number of people going

58
00:02:56,091 --> 00:03:00,000
to Mars?
First we need to get one single to Mars,

59
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,480
you know,
or a small team of people.

60
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,940
And that is something that has proven
very,

61
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:06,700
very difficult.
It's not so much a question that we

62
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:09,370
can't build rockets to take us there
because even today,

63
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:10,810
you know,
we have rockets that might have the

64
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:12,130
capability of doing that.

65
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,990
The problem is how you would keep a crew
of people alive for the journey to Mars

66
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,170
and then also alive on the surface and
get them back.

67
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,890
That would be very expensive.
And because the astronauts would not be

68
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:26,950
protected from the radiation of space
right now,

69
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:28,930
we really don't know how to keep them
alive.

70
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,500
It's not impossible.
There's a lot of work that can be done,

71
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,970
but when I see people thinking that
space x is almost ready to send people

72
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:39,910
to Mars,
that's where I have a bit of a wait and

73
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:42,880
see attitude.
I would love to see people on Mars.

74
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,280
I would love to see space x take people
to Mars.

75
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,510
I think the Tesla up there heading out
toward the asteroid belt is so cool,

76
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,830
but there's a long way to go and it's
not easy.

77
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,240
I think we're not going to get there
from a single company or a single nation

78
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,520
even.
I think that for something as large as a

79
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:03,010
mission to Mars,
we need to collaborate on a global

80
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:03,940
scale.
You know,

81
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:07,060
work with the Europeans,
work with other emerging space markets,

82
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,920
maybe work with several different
companies,

83
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:12,100
not just one.
It's not a single entity.

84
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,990
It's a planet going out and exploring
something as big as colonizing Mars.

85
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,510
I mean,
that's an amazing civilization scale

86
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:23,020
activity.
I am somewhat skeptical that in my

87
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:25,360
lifetime I will see people walking on
Mars.

88
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,840
I hope we do.
I'm not holding my breath.

89
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,510
Okay.
