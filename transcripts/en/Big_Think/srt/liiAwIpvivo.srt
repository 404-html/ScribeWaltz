1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,280
[inaudible]

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,370
organic is not a matter of belief.
Organic is codified,

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,650
regulated and it's definition is
established by the Department of

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,300
Agriculture.
So in the United States,

5
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:24,301
organic means vegetable crops that are
produced under conditions in which there

6
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:29,890
is no fertilizers,
no artificial pesticides,

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,750
and they're not genetically modified
irradiated or fertilized with sewage

8
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:35,610
sludge.
Very clear definition.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Animals must be fed organic feed,
they must be allowed access to the

10
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:42,470
outdoors.
Um,

11
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,960
and there are some other rules that
define that.

12
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:49,860
And in order to,
for a company to get a certified organic

13
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:53,160
seal on their product,
they must follow those rules and be

14
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:56,430
inspected to make sure they follow those
rules.

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,170
And almost everybody that I know who was
involved in the organic industry says

16
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:04,050
the rules are followed.
There's very little cheating.

17
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,520
Um,
and that in fact the system is pretty

18
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:12,540
tight in following the rules.
The big question is whether those rules

19
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,900
make any sense or not and whether
they're good enough,

20
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:20,901
strong enough and meaningful enough with
the most obvious loophole being the one

21
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:24,240
about animals having access to the
outdoors.

22
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,790
The rule doesn't say they have to be
outdoors.

23
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,160
The rule just says they have to have
access to.

24
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,320
That's a loophole.
