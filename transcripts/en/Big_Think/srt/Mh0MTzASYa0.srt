1
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,970
Joseph stalin ran the Savi with as as
well known and iron grip.

2
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,460
But it wasn't just his ruthlessness,
uh,

3
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,790
that was remarkable.
It was the way in which he's structured

4
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,540
governance so that it was almost
impossible for any to Soviet citizens to

5
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:34,660
have a private relationship that was
not,

6
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,700
uh,
in some sense,

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,420
uh,
known to and subject to stolen.

8
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,030
So he was the node through which all
other nodes had to go to communicate.

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,460
And Stalin who was famously paranoid,
was suspicious about any interaction

10
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,120
between the Soviet citizens and
especially between the Soviet citizen

11
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,460
and a foreigner that he didn't know
about it.

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,810
Really interesting feature of hierarchy
that doesn't get understood,

13
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,980
I think nearly well enough is that if
you are a hierarchical ruler,

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,870
you are right to be paranoid.
And it's not just the paranoid people

15
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:15,310
tend to become a dictators.
It's more that if you're a dictator,

16
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,430
you need to be paranoid because the real
threat to a hierarchy is a success for

17
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:22,450
the organized social network.

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,640
A social network,
independence of the hierarchy of the big

19
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:32,440
guy is the real threat.
Once saw that,

20
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:33,430
for example,
in Poland,

21
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,850
why did Poland,
of all the communist regimes get into

22
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:40,390
trouble first?
Because there was a really well

23
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:44,420
organized civil society,
all voluntary association,

24
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:47,440
some religious,
some north that formed a network even

25
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,410
before the solidarity trade union came
along.

26
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,910
Um,
that's lethal to a hierarchical system,

27
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,710
which is why Stalin was right.
If you want to put it this way,

28
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:05,050
to be paranoid about social networking
that he didn't control or didn't know

29
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:09,250
about it,
he understood that it doesn't take too

30
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:14,251
many additional edges in the network to
destroy the dominance of that central

31
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:17,440
node.
So one way of thinking about this is

32
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,770
imagine a paramedic,
old structure.

33
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,850
Imagine something kind of like a
Christmas tree and there was the big guy

34
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:27,430
like the ferry on top of the Christmas
tree.

35
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,080
But imagine that on this Christmas tree,
the lights are just connected to the

36
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:34,030
ferry.
They're not connected to one another.

37
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,730
Uh,
and therefore the theory decides if the

38
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:39,090
lights go on or off.
It's,

39
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,640
it's a peculiar kind of Christmas tree
that that's essentially a hierarchical

40
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:46,450
network.
It wouldn't take too many connections as

41
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:50,230
it were lateral or horizontal
connections between the lights to reduce

42
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:53,260
the centrality of the ferry on the tree.
Uh,

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,890
and ultimately you could end up
illuminating the tree without needing,

44
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,930
uh,
the ferry altogether.

45
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,290
So I think that's why dictators,
high rocks need to be paranoid.

46
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,440
Read the plays of Shakespeare.
The suspicion that always seems to haunt

47
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,810
any of Shakespeare's kings is that there
is some kind of plot,

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,330
some cabal,
some conspiracy going on.

49
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,660
Um,
and if you read the history of European

50
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:22,630
monarchy,
very often those suspicions were well

51
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:26,560
founded.
What we call social networks look like

52
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:29,950
conspiracies to absolute rulers.

53
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,340
And that's why very often in history,
the term seems to overlap what looks

54
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:38,380
like a social network to you and me.
If we're in,

55
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:43,270
it looks like a plot to the king.
If you want to see the advantages of a

56
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:48,100
hierarchical system of government,
take a trip to China and,

57
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,040
uh,
you'll see a system which is

58
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,880
extraordinarily high rock calls.
Xi Jinping is top man.

59
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,790
This system is good at doing engineering
projects.

60
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,690
If this system decides on building high
speed rail networks around China,

61
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:11,350
it can do it with astonishing speed.
If the system decides that it's going

62
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,184
to,
uh,

63
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:17,190
build cities in the expectation that
there will be a population to inhabit

64
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,330
them,
it can do that.

65
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:25,230
And so one of the most impressive
aspects of the last 30 years of human

66
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:28,420
history has been the spectacular growth
of the Chinese economy.

67
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,200
And that has been in large measure the
results of a highly effective

68
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,310
hierarchical system of planning.

69
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,030
Of course,
you would be naive if you went to

70
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,140
China's then didn't see some of the
problems with doing that.

71
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,320
Uh,
the problems of pollution that have been

72
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:50,980
a characteristic feature of modern
Chinese life.

73
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,690
There's lots of the problem of
corruption.

74
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:55,060
This is an everyday topic of
conversation in China.

75
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,210
At one party,
hierarchical system of government isn't

76
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:59,590
accountable.
It's above the law.

77
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,970
And officials,
uh,

78
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,030
have routinely skimmed off a huge sums
of money to line their own pockets.

79
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:12,500
None of this comes as any news to people
who read hi,

80
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,850
a great book.
The road to serfdom since the mid 20th

81
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:20,851
century classical liberal scholars have
said that the planned economy is bound

82
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:26,230
to be inefficient and it's bound to lead
to corruption and other abuses of power.

83
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,150
I think most people who think that way,
and I include myself in that group,

84
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:36,151
were taken by surprise by the success of
China's economic growth strategy.

85
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,810
Can this system endure through this 21st
century?

86
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,770
That is a huge question for China's
leaders and indeed for the world.

87
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,700
If you are like me,
skeptical about that of political

88
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:02,270
centralization,
you'll kind of sitting waiting for

89
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:07,250
something to go wrong.
Because the defects of hierarchical

90
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:11,630
system of government tends to be that
it's not responsive to,

91
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,010
to signals from down below that top
down.

92
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:19,130
Governance tends to be somewhat def.
Uh,

93
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,800
not only does it not necessarily get
market signals,

94
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:26,801
it may miss out on political dissidents,
political discontent or to put it

95
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:30,020
differently,
you've created through rapid

96
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:32,810
industrialization,
the biggest middle class in all of

97
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:35,450
history,
the biggest bourgeoisie in history.

98
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,560
And if Karl Marx,
we're here sitting next to me,

99
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,010
uh,
I think he'd agree that that was very

100
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:47,990
hard to reconcile with.
The system devised a bimalleolar Dong to

101
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:52,580
centralize power in the hands of a
single party marks would expect the

102
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:55,940
Borzois z in China to do what the
European bourgeoisie did in the 19th

103
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:57,890
century.
Demand property rights,

104
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:01,430
and therefore the rule of law to protect
property rights and therefore some

105
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:03,170
elements of representation in
government.

106
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,610
So even from a Marxist perspective,
something has to change.

107
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,120
So hierarchical systems of government
over time tend at some point to suffer a

108
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:17,870
loss of legitimacy,
a challenge from below.

109
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,470
And we've seen that.
We saw it in the history of the Soviet

110
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,750
Union,
but we've seen it else were much less

111
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:28,751
sophisticated hierarchical systems like
the military regimes of Latin America or

112
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:31,940
the presidential regimes of the Middle
East,

113
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,390
uh,
came to grief in some cases well before

114
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:36,440
the Soviet Union did.

115
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,430
Mm.
