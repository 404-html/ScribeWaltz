1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,340
Can you go out in the streets in New
York and ask that question?

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,470
Younger people were pretty fired up.
I,

3
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:16,880
uh,
I,

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,470
I've never been a,
you know,

5
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:19,970
bushes,
the devil Kinda guy.

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,720
I really take offense at sort of the,
the uh,

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,910
uh,
comparisons to totalitarianism.

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,140
Somebody sent me an email recently and
compared,

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,130
uh,
you know,

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,780
this administration,
what it was doing to what had been done

11
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:37,520
in sort of communist the early years of
the communist Soviet Union.

12
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:39,140
And there was some comparison and I just
wrote,

13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,260
I write this people,
I consider it my personal responsibility

14
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:45,350
as a journalist to write people back
even when they're praising me and being

15
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:46,990
nice and I don't need the fight,
you know,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,290
to write people back and say,
look,

17
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,390
I have to reject this premise.
This is not good.

18
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:52,640
Like there's nothing about this country
today.

19
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,910
That was true in the early years of the
communist Soviet Union.

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,250
Like you,
you say what you want about George W dot

21
00:00:58,251 --> 00:00:59,690
Bush.
He is not stolen.

22
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:00,560
So let's not,
you know,

23
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,840
be ridiculous.
Having said that,

24
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,330
I think his legacy will be treated
harshly.

25
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,500
I'm not alone.
Of course,

26
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,900
that's the majority of your book
reminded my reason if for no other

27
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:10,550
reason,
if you took all the policies out of it,

28
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:12,570
so you just took a rock out of it.
Let's say,

29
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,270
let's say a rock is not the defining a
thing of his in a defining issue.

30
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:19,520
We think it is now,
or let's say it's not foreign policy,

31
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,460
if for no other reason than he entered
office at a time of,

32
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,800
of incredible,
paralyzing division in the country that

33
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:30,830
he promised to amend it and that he made
it infinitely worse.

34
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,500
Uh,
that is his greatest disservice as a

35
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:35,850
president.
That alone makes him a failed president,

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,110
if nothing else did in my mind,
uh,

37
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,420
because he,
he retarded the dialogue and the

38
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:44,210
conversation in a country that
desperately needed to advance it.

39
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,670
And for that,
I think history will judge them harshly

40
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:48,200
and whatever else,
uh,

41
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,940
you know,
whatever else comes out of his

42
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:51,680
presidency will be judged beyond this.
