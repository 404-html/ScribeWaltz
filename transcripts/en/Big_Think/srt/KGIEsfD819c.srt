1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,460
Political and world wars don't happen by
accident,

2
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:13,380
done any more than poverty held us back
for them.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,490
They are all curable.
They're all presented.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,610
Uh,
no.

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,280
You know,
there are big interest being served by

6
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:27,150
these conflicts.
So it means standing up to the big

7
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:32,151
interest ad means mobilizing public
opinion at means the media playing a,

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,080
a crucially important role of
highlighting and informing and educating

9
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,350
people on his objective away as it's
possible.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,800
But yes,
there can be an any given situation

11
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,210
there.
Con,

12
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,210
they adjust and a proper sacrament which
means compromise,

13
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,610
which means putting yourself and your
opponent's position.

14
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,920
Uh,
and you know,

15
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,000
if you want proof of that,
the proof does lie in Ireland to a

16
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:12,570
certain extent.
Here we have enp Islam and Martin

17
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,060
Mcguinness.
Cool,

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,230
cool.
Uh,

19
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,820
managing
partners and a power sharing

20
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,070
arrangement.
Uh,

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,910
we used to have the USSR,
no longer there.

22
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,970
We,
W we,

23
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,790
we used to have a cold war,
no longer there.

24
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,220
Uh,
there aren't any certainties once,

25
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,250
once shifts appear.
And I'm the things that I've learned and

26
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,060
I've,
I believe,

27
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,750
with grid conviction,
is that people who respond to the

28
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:50,751
political conditions in which they live.
So if you want to change our people to

29
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:54,120
respond or think changed their
conditions,

30
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,960
don't try to attack their core values
are.

31
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,390
I mean,
you can obviously have your own view of

32
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:01,860
it and you can argue the case.
But,

33
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,160
uh,
fundamentalism from whatever position I

34
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:09,570
think is,
is a sensory wrong EPA and somebody has

35
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:11,790
used to,
uh,

36
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,430
to inflect repression or injustice upon
other people.

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,360
So if you want to change our human
beings,

38
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:24,500
respond,
then changed the political conditions in

39
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,060
which they live.
