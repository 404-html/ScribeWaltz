1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,240
I feel the obligation,
I think it was called the obligation to

2
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:15,371
be an optimist,
that by making this analysis just based

3
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:20,591
on what I read in the newspaper is not.
It doesn't necessarily mean that that's

4
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:25,100
how things are going to happen.
I mean every day that people involved,

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,650
even within as critical as I am of
Europe,

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,300
there are voices within Europe who feel
that things are going in the wrong

7
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:35,750
direction and I believe always that you
can.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,140
There's always the possibility to make
change in that.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,150
Yeah,
I'm optimistic,

10
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:41,330
but.
