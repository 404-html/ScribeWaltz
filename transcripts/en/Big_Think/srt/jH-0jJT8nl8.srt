1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,680
The value added to theater and you know,
I know this is a debate that has gone on

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:07,350
for millions of years and hopefully
we'll still go over a of years,

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,410
is that there is no experience like it.
It's live your live,

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,910
they're live,
they're feeding off you,

5
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:16,380
your feeding off them,
you know,

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,610
and an audience senses that and that's,
that is an added value and I don't

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,480
really care how technology pushes us
forward.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,370
There's never going to be anything like
sitting in a theater with 100 or 1000

9
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:31,410
people around you laughing,
crying,

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,810
you know,
doing all those emotional things that,

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,790
that hopefully good theater will do for
you.

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,150
And my challenge and the challenge that
we have as an industry is getting people

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,870
to recognize that and into,
you know,

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,680
the theater and you know,
the complaint that I hear I hear to the

15
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:54,681
most about theater specifically the
price and the accessibility and the

16
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:56,760
accessibility.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,070
I'm going to go backwards.
The accessibility is something as an

18
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:02,040
industry,
I think actually technology and the

19
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,010
theater world can marry more.
There are people out there that don't

20
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:07,620
know how to get tickets,
so they think that getting tickets are

21
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:09,060
complicated.
They don't understand.

22
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:11,220
You can go online now and,
and I think,

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,470
you know,
the technology in that case has helped

24
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,480
the theater industry tremendously.
I mean there was a day,

25
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:21,840
and I'm not that old,
but there was a day that I remember the

26
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:25,880
only way you could get a theater ticket
was to go to the box office know and,

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,420
and now it's,
it's,

28
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,640
we've expanded that.
So it is,

29
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,700
it is amazing.
To me the idea of it being too expensive

30
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:39,480
is something that you know,
is a challenge to the industry to and to

31
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:44,250
that I always say my job is to let
people know there are many ways and many

32
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:45,960
different prices of seeing shows.

33
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,940
There's the tk ats booth,
there's a,

34
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,081
you know,
there's,

35
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:51,360
there's direct mail,
there's email blasts.

36
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:56,361
We're starting to use that technology.
And so I think those two obstacles when

37
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,590
you add it together and the added value
is to,

38
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,150
to get the world on the same.
There's no experience like live theater

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,960
that they can't be live streaming hd
filming.

40
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,200
Um,
even the audience that is listening to

41
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:16,350
this conversation right now,
it would be,

42
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:20,540
it's not at all like if we were sitting
in a room live and that's the,

43
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,750
the excitement of live theater.
We find that the younger generation,

44
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:27,510
unless they have come,
been brought to the theater,

45
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,140
don't get it.
It seems like their grandmothers form of

46
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:32,490
entertainment.
Um,

47
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,370
and you know,
to that personally,

48
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,860
I have been a,
and I,

49
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,040
most of my career have been a big
advocate of getting a school children

50
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,970
into the theater and whether that is a
Wednesday matinee where you donate

51
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:55,290
tickets or a,
we have a program right now with the

52
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,750
city school system that we choose,
you know,

53
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,100
one school every Wednesday matinee.

54
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,950
Um,
and they get 100 tickets.

55
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,670
Some of the schools do it on merit,
some do it on financial need.

56
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:08,200
You know,
each school is a little bit different.

57
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,900
But I find,
and this is one of the greatest joys

58
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:15,901
that I have as a producer,
is watching those kids watch a show.

59
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:19,960
Many of them for the very first time and
you can tell which ones are hooked,

60
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,520
you can tell because again,
they're sensing without any explanation

61
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,560
there watching someone live.
I remember once when I was producing a

62
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:33,310
musical called jellies,
last jam and the Lake Gregory hines play

63
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:37,540
Jelly Roll Morton and we took every
Wednesday matinee.

64
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,720
They were a hundred inner school in city
school.

65
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,620
Kids that got to see the show and one
Wednesday matinee.

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,500
A couple of kids didn't realize,
you know,

67
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:50,950
they saw it was live but they didn't
know the decorum of theater and they

68
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:51,640
were screaming out.

69
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,440
Gregory Gregory.
Yeah,

70
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,580
my man,
you know,

71
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:59,200
and they were just so excited and he
kind of stopped the show and he just

72
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:00,220
very calmly said,
you know,

73
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,040
we are so glad you are here is so cool,
but you know,

74
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,200
what's not cool?
I'm trying to,

75
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:07,030
you know,
so I'll tell you what man,

76
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,010
why don't you like,
let,

77
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,970
let's do the show.
That's how this works.

78
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:13,990
And then you guys come back stage and we
can wrap and these kids will like over

79
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,930
the moon.
And it wasn't because they were,

80
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,370
you know,
Ruda some,

81
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:19,680
but they will hooked.
Man.

82
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:23,170
I was watching those kids,
they were so hooked onto live theater.

83
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:26,080
And I thought this is cool.
They had just never experienced that

84
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:27,400
before.
You know,

85
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:28,390
every,
every form,

86
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,090
event,
attendance,

87
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,140
these kids that had up to this point in
their life was a movie,

88
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:33,820
was a TV,
was a video,

89
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:37,450
was something they had never gone and
had that,

90
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,430
oh my God,
there's a person up there.

91
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,830
And they happen to know the person was
A.

92
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:43,810
Yeah,
I love when that happens.

93
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:45,820
And that's a big,
huge added value.

94
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,970
When I was a kid,
they were saying the great white way is

95
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:49,960
dead.
No,

96
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:51,640
they were calling other fabulous
invalid.

97
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,260
I don't believe it ever will die because
of that.

98
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,820
A feeling that,
that idea that you can't get it anywhere

99
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:03,010
else.
And I think the younger generation,

100
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,950
they may be slower to get there.
But um,

101
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,090
you know,
if we do our job right,

102
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:08,280
we'll get them,
you know,

103
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,600
there,
there are those kind of hip cool shows

104
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,610
where it's cool to go and they go,
wow,

105
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:13,840
this isn't so bad.
And you know.

106
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,950
Yeah.
So you kinda got them.

107
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:16,400
Yeah.
