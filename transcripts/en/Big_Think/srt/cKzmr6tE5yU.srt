1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,110
We are seeing now climate impacts that
are tremendously costly in tremendously

2
00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:09,020
challenging in EPA.
His role is to try to make turn that

3
00:00:09,021 --> 00:00:12,500
challenge into a positive message moving
forward,

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,290
give communities the tools they need to
adapt,

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,960
you know,
recognize that the time for action is

6
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:21,170
now.
So in many ways the the problem that we

7
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:25,760
had in the past was twofold.
People didn't see the impacts as as,

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,760
as much as they're seeing them and
feeling them today.

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,950
It wasn't already.
It's happening.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,430
What do I do?
And so we were predicting things that

11
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:37,250
might happen,
but it's taken so long to take action.

12
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:41,270
Those predictions are already here and
frankly we never predicted the kind of

13
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:46,271
impacts that we are seeing today.
Climate is always portrayed on newscasts

14
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,920
as being some kind of big debate.
You know,

15
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:53,360
the big debate among the scientists is
that 97 percent of them know it's

16
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:55,580
happening and I really worried about it.

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,420
Three percent are skeptical.
That's not a balance.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,600
That's an overwhelming majority in that
needs to drive the decision,

19
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,030
especially in a democracy.
That's how we work.

20
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,860
We're working really hard with faith
leaders in this country because many of

21
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:16,460
the people listened to their faith.
Lead is for direction in the faith.

22
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:21,461
Leaders are extremely concerned that
climate change is an issue which most

23
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:25,910
importantly more significantly impacts
low income and minority communities.

24
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,070
The least of these are going to be the
most impacted in a changing climate,

25
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,100
so we are moving with with an
ecumenical,

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,680
a constituency in the faith community to
bring this message to their constituents

27
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,980
and it's extremely important to
recognize your own limitations about

28
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:48,140
who,
who you're good at talking to and who's

29
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:52,430
going to believe you and who the people
you're trying to influence listened to

30
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,470
because we can talk all we want about
the science at EPA,

31
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,240
but you need to put that into people's
homes and ears in a way that they're

32
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:03,770
going to listen,
absorb,

33
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,250
and know they can be part of the.

34
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,910
The solutions moving forward that gets
them off the diamond builds a

35
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:15,911
constituencies you need to succeed in
something that is really as big as this.

36
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,090
The challenge of climate change is
enormous for us,

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,560
and so you need to attack that from all
different angles and make sure to get

38
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,830
everybody engaged.
I don't need to fight the climate

39
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:31,040
deniers now.
That's not what I think we need.

40
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,480
The rallying cry needs to be.
What actions do we take that are going

41
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:37,460
to address climate,
both from,

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,980
you know,
we need to mitigate and make sure that

43
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:44,060
we're reducing those impacts,
but also let's do it in a way that grows

44
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:47,780
a low carbon economy.
Let's make the United States flourish

45
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,900
because we stood up to this problem and
we took action.
