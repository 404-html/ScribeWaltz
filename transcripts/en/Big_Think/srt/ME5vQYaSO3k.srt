1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,170
Okay,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,150
many,
many,

3
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:07,560
many,
many more.

4
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:11,850
Hundreds of eggs are fertilized then
become humans.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,220
Eggs get fertilized,
and by that I mean sperm get accepted by

6
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:20,970
over a lot,
but that's not all you need.

7
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:24,240
You have to attach to the uterine wall,
the inside of the,

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,930
of a womb,
a woman's womb.

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,450
But if you're going to hold that as a
standard,

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,520
that is to say,
if you're going to say when an egg is

11
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:39,120
fertilized,
it's therefore all has the same rights

12
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:42,180
as an individual,
then who are you going to?

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,730
Whom are you going to sue?
Whom are you going to imprison?

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,660
Every woman who's had a fertilized egg
pass through her,

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,210
every guy whose sperm is fertilized an
egg and then it didn't become a human of

16
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:56,820
all these people failed you.
Uh,

17
00:00:56,821 --> 00:01:00,480
it's just reflection,
but deep scientific lack of

18
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:03,610
understanding and uh,
you,

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,590
the,
he will do literally,

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,560
apparently,
literally don't know what you're talking

21
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:09,394
about.

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,990
And so,
uh,

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,250
uh,
when it comes to women's rights with

24
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:18,730
respect to their reproduction,
I think you should leave it to women.

25
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,140
This is really a,
you cannot help but notice,

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,420
I mean,
I'm not the first guy to observe this.

27
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,020
You have a lot of men of European
descent passing these extraordinary laws

28
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,580
based on ignorance.
I'm sorry,

29
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:37,990
you guys,
I know it was written or your

30
00:01:37,991 --> 00:01:40,840
interpretation of a book written five
century,

31
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,100
5,000 years ago,
50 centuries ago,

32
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,420
makes you think that when a man and a
woman have sexual intercourse,

33
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:57,601
they always have a baby that's wrong.
And so to pass laws based on that belief

34
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:02,500
is inconsistent with nature.
I mean,

35
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,650
it's hard not to get frustrated with
this.

36
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,820
Everybody,
uh,

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,020
and I know
it.

38
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,190
Nobody likes abortion.
Okay?

39
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,870
But you can't tell somebody what to do.
I mean,

40
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,300
she has rights over this,
especially if she doesn't like the guy

41
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:27,230
that got her pregnant.

42
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,440
She doesn't want anything to do with
your genes.

43
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,690
Get over it,
especially if you were raped and all

44
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,220
this.
So,

45
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,950
uh,
it's very frustrating on the,

46
00:02:36,951 --> 00:02:38,630
on the outside,
on the other side,

47
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,170
uh,
we have so many more important things to

48
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:46,130
be dealing with.
We have so many more problems to

49
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,840
squander resources on this argument
based on bad science,

50
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:53,930
on just lack of understanding.
It's very frustrating.

51
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,790
You wouldn't know how big a human egg
was if it weren't for microscopes.

52
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,900
There weren't.
For scientists who are medical

53
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:06,100
researchers looking diligently.
You wouldn't know the process.

54
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:10,060
You wouldn't have that shot,
the famous shot or shots where the sperm

55
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:13,480
are bumping up against the egg.
You wouldn't have that without science.

56
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,950
So then to claim that you know,
the next step when you obviously don't,

57
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,380
it's trouble when you.
Okay,

58
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,140
let me do that again.
Let me just pull back.

59
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,840
At some point.
We have to respect the facts.

60
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,390
Recommending or insisting on abstinence
has been completely ineffective.

61
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,780
Just being objective here.
A closing abortion clinics,

62
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,530
closing,
uh,

63
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,130
not getting,
giving women access to birth control has

64
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:46,330
not been an effective way to lead to
healthier societies.

65
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,800
This,
I mean,

66
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,310
I think we all know that and I
understand that you have deeply held

67
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,050
beliefs and you want to and it really is
ultimately out of respect for people,

68
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,290
in this case,
your perception of unborn people.

69
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,770
I understand that,
but I really encourage you to look at

70
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:05,100
the facts,
and I know people are now critical of

71
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,700
the expression,
fact based,

72
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,960
but what's wrong with that?
So it's really encourage you to not tell

73
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:19,141
women what to do and not pursue these
laws that really are in nobody's best

74
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:24,370
interest.
Just really be objective about this.

75
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:26,170
We have other problems to solve.
Everybody,

76
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,930
come on,
come on,

77
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,850
let's work together.
