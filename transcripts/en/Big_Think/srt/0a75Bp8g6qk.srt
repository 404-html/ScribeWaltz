1
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,280
Alex in 94 I remember to cover.
So we had divided,

2
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:17,310
you know,
had the White House in the hands of Bill

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,730
Clinton and then congress in the hands 
of Newt Gingrich.

4
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,860
Um,
but yes,

5
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:23,694
I certainly think that all of them,
the trends at the moment for a 

6
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,423
democratic sweep in November,
I don't think we should take anything 

7
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:36,270
for granted because John McCain is still
a very,

8
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,243
very much seen in the media as the John 
Mccain of 2000 and not the John Mccain 

9
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:45,460
of 2008.
Um,

10
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,390
but nevertheless,
that is definitely very likely.

11
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:49,224
And therefore,
if Lou real leadership is exercise is a 

12
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:53,184
very good chance that we could end up 
with finally having some from low 

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,863
universal health care insurance,
which is desperately needed in this 

14
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:04,140
country for the 7 million people are 
uninsured.

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,753
And,
um,

16
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,133
also that we would be able to move 
closer to energy independence and bring 

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,520
the truth,
Tom from Iraq,

18
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:15,750
that,
that I thing is,

19
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,510
has to be our number one action.
