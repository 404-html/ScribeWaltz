1
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,770
There's a trajectory in the shows that
have done at Moma up in there,

2
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:15,300
it's almost 14 years and it's a
trajectory that is personal,

3
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:17,580
but that it's at the same time as
institutional,

4
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:18,690
you know,
from the beginning.

5
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:23,691
Moma has alternated in design very
historical exhibitions that are meant to

6
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:28,110
advance the scholarly field with
exhibitions that are instead and

7
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,180
programs that are instead about people's
lives,

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,820
about how design can improve people's
lives,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,180
about,
uh,

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,780
issues that pertain to that particular
moment.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,400
Just to give you an example,
you know,

12
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:42,600
Moma had a series in the 19 thirties
that was called good called good design

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,460
under $5,
$10,

14
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,070
blah,
blah blah during the war because you,

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,970
because people had no access to steel
and aluminum and other materials.

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,970
They did a show called good design in
times of war.

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,920
So it was always with an attention to
people's needs in my particular,

18
00:00:58,921 --> 00:00:59,754
um,
um,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,660
career.

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,400
I tried always to look at both people's
lives and also technology advancements

21
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,880
in always this to this two spheres
coming together.

22
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:13,140
So the first show that I did in 95 was
called Newton materials and contemporary

23
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:16,080
design.
It was about a revolution in the way

24
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:20,520
materials were designed and implemented,
something that gave designers more power

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,930
to actually find to not only the objects
but also the materials,

26
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:29,550
so it was technology and it was life and
then I went on and did other shows.

27
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,530
Sorry,
can you cut in between?

28
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:36,420
Okay.
And then I went on and did other shows

29
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:38,820
that were about people's lives.
Just to give you an example,

30
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:43,821
in 2000 I did a show called work spheres
because@thattimeitwasthe.com boom.

31
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:46,200
It was the beginning of wireless
technology,

32
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:49,190
so there was a lot of excitement.
We all went,

33
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,990
almost were all drunk,
right?

34
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,960
With this kind of possibilities,
but at the same time wireless technology

35
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:56,070
was not really working.

36
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,520
We were always traveling with too many
plugs and then the plug didn't work.

37
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:02,160
The server at home did not connect.
We had to dial in.

38
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,880
I mean it was just hell.
So it was about wireless technology,

39
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:08,310
new possibilities and people's real
lives.

40
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:12,480
So it was all this new concepts for
working and traveling and so on and so

41
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:16,050
forth.
And about two years ago I did a show on

42
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:20,370
design and safety because safety has
become a really big concern,

43
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:21,570
you know,
the world has changed.

44
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't need to explain,
it was something that was conceived

45
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:25,650
before nine slash 11,
but,

46
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,060
and it was topped by 9:11 because I
freaked out at that time and waited for

47
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:32,370
a long time.
So it was only two years ago,

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,930
but it was about design and safety.
Now I've come to the point that wireless

49
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:40,740
technology really works,
that we really are in communication with

50
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:44,490
many different parts of the world.
We work at different scales,

51
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:46,980
we work in different time zones on
screens,

52
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:50,640
have different resolutions.
We speak with people from all over the

53
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:53,670
world.
We are sometimes alone and sometimes in

54
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:57,120
the middle of the gigantic route we've
become much more elastic.

55
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,480
And uh,
um,

56
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,280
it's an about these possibilities,
new technologies and the connection

57
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:07,390
between design and science.
So it really is about us negotiating all

58
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:10,520
these changes and negotiating progress
with the help of design.
