1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,450
Well,
I think,

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,080
you know,
there's a couple of very important

3
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:10,220
dimensions to consider here.
We haven't seen a lot of,

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,560
of change in public opinion about
climate change.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,950
Um,
uh,

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:15,870
were,
uh,

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,170
in part because of the downturn in the
economy where we're at,

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,140
uh,
uh,

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,470
uh,
an Arab in terms of public enthusiasm,

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,590
uh,
for action on climate change and concern

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,010
over climate change.
Um,

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,540
and that's somewhat part of a natural
cycle that you see on,

13
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,600
on social problems generally.
And on environmental problems sort of at

14
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,690
the height of concern about climate
change was around 2007,

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,080
uh,
with the release of income,

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,860
inconvenient truth in a record amount
of,

17
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,490
of news,
attention to that issue.

18
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,790
But it's almost as if the public became
a habituated or use or desensitized to a

19
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:53,940
lot of the stories and the narratives
about environmental impacts and

20
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:58,440
environmental disaster that we're at the
really strongly featured a around that

21
00:00:58,441 --> 00:00:59,130
time.

22
00:00:59,130 --> 00:00:59,371
And,
uh,

23
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:01,980
and,
and with the performance of the economy,

24
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,440
uh,
we started moving into a downward cycle

25
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:07,200
of concern.
So the oil spill hasn't really changed

26
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:08,310
or shifted,
uh,

27
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,100
that,
that,

28
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,530
that period that we're in right now in
terms of an issue or a issue fatigue

29
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,190
with,
with,

30
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,180
uh,
with climate change.

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,650
But what we have seen is a major change
in public opinion when it comes to

32
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:24,320
asking the public about weighing the
importance of either economic growth or,

33
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,250
or energy or exploration with the need
for environmental protection or

34
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:30,800
conservation.
Um,

35
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,280
uh,
between,

36
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,320
uh,
the month before,

37
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:37,140
according to Gallup polls,
the month before the oil spill.

38
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,690
And then roughly a month and a half
afterwards,

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,400
we saw that a majority of the public
literally reversed course that,

40
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,930
uh,
that before the oil spill,

41
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:50,160
the majority of the public favored
energy exploration on economic

42
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:52,200
development over environmental
protection.

43
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,020
Uh,
six weeks later that public preference

44
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:58,230
had flipped.
And I think that's something that's been

45
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:01,500
overlooked in the discussion.
There's been a lot of blame on the

46
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:04,770
administration and on environmental
groups for not taking advantage of this

47
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:06,870
major focusing event.
But in fact,

48
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:08,970
I think there has been a lot of the
news.

49
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,950
The news attention has done the work for
an environmental groups and has opened

50
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:16,800
up an opportunity,
at least a latent sentiment to think

51
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:19,470
about environmental protection over
economic growth.

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,620
Even in this period of economic
recession.
