1
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,890
From New York City,
Manhattan,

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,083
midtown.

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,350
Um,
I grew up near the United Nations.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,110
And how has it shaped me?
Um,

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,690
I think it's given me an urban
sensibility,

6
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:28,880
if you can say such a thing.
Uh,

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,720
which means that I feel really
disoriented and uncomfortable in the

8
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:39,821
countryside and much more comfortable
and cities and m would rather go to a

9
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:48,131
second or third tier New York City,
then I wander out in the wilderness for

10
00:00:50,721 --> 00:00:53,240
a long time because then I would get
scared.

11
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,610
I think,
uh,

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,340
I'm,
I'm one of those city people that is

13
00:00:58,341 --> 00:01:03,341
comforted by the sounds of the city,
like ambulances and a car alarms,

14
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,420
people screaming,
uh,

15
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,390
crazy people screaming in the middle of
the night.

16
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,553
And,
uh,

17
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,150
I,
I do love,

18
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,090
I actually do love going.
Uh,

19
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,660
I spent,
I went to sleep away camp in Maine and

20
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:21,230
I,
that was really an ideal like time for

21
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:22,490
me.
Uh,

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,370
so,
but I tend to go back and forth between

23
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:27,580
both extremes.
Right now I'm in there.

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,230
I think it makes me,
uh,

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,410
pretty scattered often when I'm in the
city in New York.

26
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:43,244
And,
uh,

27
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,713
when I,
when I'm,

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,950
I'm constantly moving around and doing
things,

29
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:53,951
it's a lot more difficult to find time
to think and concentrate and have any

30
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:57,600
kind of sustained thought.
Um,

31
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,780
so ideally I guess I'd like to go live
back and live between the city and

32
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:05,610
country,
but I never have really done that.

33
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:07,910
I,
I sometimes went to friend's country

34
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:10,040
houses,
but when I was growing up,

35
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,700
but I never had one.
Uh,

36
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,350
but I guess it makes me pretty scattered
and a have a bad memory and prone to

37
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:19,940
speaking and articulately.

38
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,070
He's a main contributions.
I think the city.

39
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,180
I love living in Brooklyn and

40
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,370
most of my friends were there and it,
there's a sense of neighborhood.

41
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,230
I live in Cobble Hill.
And do you see people on the street that

42
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:43,470
he recognize?
Um,

43
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,660
and don't talk to,
cause that would be weird,

44
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,910
but did you recognize them?
And,

45
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:49,480
uh,
it's,

46
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,870
it has a,
I really like feeling,

47
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,970
uh,
being part of a neighborhood with some

48
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:58,710
history and the part of New York where
I'm from in midtown has been,

49
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,590
um,
torn up and,

50
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:05,120
and mixed around.
And,

51
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:08,560
and the people who live there are people
who weren't there when I was there when

52
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:10,690
I grew up there.
And,

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,770
um,
the buildings have totally changed the

54
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:16,450
level of magnitude.
Uh,

55
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,710
when we're,
when I grew up,

56
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:21,400
it was a lot of buildings,
like in the neighborhood I live in now,

57
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,810
three,
four story buildings.

58
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:26,110
And now there are 90 story residential
apartment buildings.

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,940
Um,
and it's,

60
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,780
it's not a friendly place and I feel
like a much more comfortable,

61
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:32,960
uh.
