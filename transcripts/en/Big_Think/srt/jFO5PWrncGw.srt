1
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,880
I think key to Improv is always
listening to embracing it's positivity,

2
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:10,830
it's hearing things and not shutting
them down.

3
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:14,520
It's trying to find ways to make them
work and I think in the business world,

4
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:18,620
I would imagine that's very valuable.
The idea that it's very frustrating to

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,810
be told no all the time.
Improv really revolves around the idea

6
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,210
of like whatever you come at me with,
I'm going to say yes to it.

7
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:25,740
That's our reality.
Let's get to work.

8
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:27,930
Let's start there.
So just the idea of saying yes to each

9
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:29,670
other,
not shutting down ideas,

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,130
seeing if there's ways to make ideas
workable,

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,170
making that your default setting of
like,

12
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:35,760
I really want to respect what you're
saying.

13
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:39,060
See if there's a way to take it
somewhere else versus here's all the

14
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:41,760
things that are wrong with it.
Think it's just a very positive

15
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:42,300
mentality.

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,840
So I think a lot of people that come
across it get very addicted to it

17
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:48,360
because it does feel different.
Especially as a New Yorker.

18
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,870
We're just used to a world where
everybody's kind of grumpy all the time

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,240
and moving fast.
They don't want to deal with each other.

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,880
The idea of showing any emotion in
public,

21
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,100
not good,
the idea of slowing down to deal with

22
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,350
someone else's ideas and emotions.
Not Good.

23
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:03,540
Like we're New Yorkers.
We want to get where we're going.

24
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:06,810
So I think Improv really looks at a side
of life that's like,

25
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:09,420
well,
what if we let all that go for a little

26
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:13,830
while and just really work on sort of
positively embracing each other's ideas

27
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:15,120
and,
and uh,

28
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,370
and really listening hard to what other
people have to say.

29
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:20,100
So it's a pretty beautiful thing when
it's going right.

30
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,870
Very often what you'll see happen and
improv classes when people get nervous

31
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:27,270
about how it's going is they'll start
saying,

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,470
hey,
when,

33
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,303
when,
uh,

34
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,100
when dad gets home,
he's going to be really mad.

35
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,510
Or they'll say like,
hey,

36
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:36,870
when we get to reno,
stuff's really going to hit the fan.

37
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:37,980
And they start saying like,
hey,

38
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:40,730
this thing that's going to happen,
or this thing,

39
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,510
hey,
remember when you did that thing back

40
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:43,680
then?
I'm really mad about it.

41
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,770
I think one of the things about
listening is that it's always at it's

42
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:49,320
most powerful when it's present,
when it's right here,

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,410
when it's right now,
and that's been a lesson about Improv

44
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:55,830
that I think just made me a much more
social person.

45
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:59,130
Like it just made me like when I would
go have pitch meetings,

46
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:02,160
I was just able to have it better.
Even in my personal life,

47
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:03,720
like I was just.
I got when I,

48
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,110
when I started really thinking hard
about these improv lessons,

49
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,180
not to get weird,
but like my dating life just got so much

50
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:12,330
better because the,
the thing I always stress that I think

51
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:16,560
apply just any conversation,
I always ask people to answer these

52
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:17,970
three questions when they're
improvising.

53
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,550
Why these people?
Why right here,

54
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,520
why right now?
I always just drill that why these

55
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:24,640
people?
Why right here,

56
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:27,090
why right now?
Meaning if you're not just.

57
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,780
If you're in a scene and there's two
people and you're talking about people

58
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:34,110
who aren't here like they're not here,
they probably aren't the most

59
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,940
interesting thing for an audience to
hear about.

60
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:38,960
If you're talking about a different
location than the scene,

61
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,690
the scenes taking place in,
then why isn't the scene unfolding

62
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:43,950
there?
It sounds more interesting.

63
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:47,340
Why are you teasing an audience?
So and another thing too,

64
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,510
people will often go like,
hey,

65
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:50,670
you'll never believe what's inside this
briefcase.

66
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,930
And it's like,
well that's invisible.

67
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,000
Let's just talk to each other us things.
We can find common ground,

68
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,850
whether that's positive things,
disagreements we might actually have.

69
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:04,240
Why are these people in this location at
this time?

70
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,590
Why isn't this the scene where choosing
to show the audience so the more we can

71
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:11,860
just make things present between the
people right there,

72
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,230
the less the audience has to suspend
their disbelief and imagine the better

73
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,300
the listening is going to be and the
harder it's going to hit.

74
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:23,170
And what we find when that happens in
Improv is your simple choices can

75
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:28,171
actually get huge reactions because if
you and I were doing a scene and I came

76
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:31,240
at you and start at the scene by saying,
you know what,

77
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:35,320
like everything that happened in Canada,
we can never talk about it again.

78
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,600
That sounds like it has really high
stakes,

79
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,680
but now the audience has to figure out,
well what happened in Canada and why are

80
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,810
we all scared of it?
Whereas if I just looked at you and

81
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:44,644
said,
hey,

82
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,060
I'm so scared and I need you to help me
through it.

83
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,260
That sounds like a more vague thing with
less comedic potential,

84
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:56,200
but an audience that they're scared and
you have to help each other.

85
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,280
Why?
Why are they scared?

86
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:59,040
They're scared right now and they can
help each other.

87
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,210
Great,
and it's a human connection that we can

88
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:04,840
latch onto,
so being present in the moment with each

89
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:07,180
other.
Nothing else you're going to work out.

90
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,460
It's gonna.
Make your improv scene so much better.

91
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,860
I feel it makes a lot of conversations
better to.

92
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,540
I'm a really big fan lately of the
phrase slow as slow,

93
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,280
as fast,
slow as fast,

94
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,610
and what I mean by that is like,
especially in the context I can,

95
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,710
I can speak to it in the context of
people who

96
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,090
go on stage,
which is like we forget that when we're

97
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:31,870
on stage and we're improvising and we're
bouncing ideas back and forth and

98
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,380
audience,
it's really hard for them to keep up and

99
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:37,660
they don't really know why we're making
the choices we're making because we're

100
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:40,720
trained in this and we have classes in
this so we can go.

101
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,100
So that to.
To them it looks like it's moving a

102
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,960
million miles an hour.
Like most people when they see an Improv

103
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:47,681
show,
if they like it,

104
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:51,640
they remember that first one is being
like the best show they ever saw and it

105
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:53,710
probably wasn't.
It's probably just that these people

106
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,000
knew what they were doing.
So much.

107
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,870
So one of the things I always like to
stress about slowing down,

108
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,550
slowing down,
slowing down is this idea.

109
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:05,140
It's actually something that I learned
from my wife uses this phrase because

110
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:06,610
she is an aerialist shit.
Her,

111
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:09,160
she was an aerialist for many years.
She was a dancer who would do all this

112
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:12,850
work with harnesses and rigging and
flying around from the ceiling and she

113
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:15,400
told me that phrase and it's stuck in my
head because she always said like,

114
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,760
if you have a problem with your harness,
you want to get it fixed fast so you can

115
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:21,520
go back to the the act you want to get
back in there.

116
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,210
But remember to the people watching like
no matter how long it takes,

117
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,540
no matter how slowly move,
you're still flying around in the sky.

118
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,120
And I think for Improv that really
applies well.

119
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:33,970
If like no matter how we can really take
a breath,

120
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,410
the audience is going to be blown away
if we do our jobs right.

121
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,540
We don't need to move fast to impress
them like the,

122
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,040
the desires.
Just joke,

123
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:42,521
joke,
joke,

124
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:43,001
laugh,
laugh,

125
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:44,470
laugh at that.
But you can smother it.

126
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,630
So another thing I often say about it
too is like we have to remember when

127
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,520
we're improvising that like it's sort of
like building a fire,

128
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:55,000
like you have to start with the kindle
and you have to start with just a spark

129
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:56,680
and you can't just throw the big logs
on.

130
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:59,180
If you just try to pile everything on,
it's not going to go anywhere.

131
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,790
The audience is going to smell a rat.
I'm not going to be with it.

132
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,580
So for me,
I think the advice I can give anyone is

133
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,910
just remember someone who is a
professional doing what they do at any

134
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,860
speed is probably going to blow away and
novice.

135
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:14,570
They're probably going to have total
control.

136
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,820
And when we rush,
we actually can give that away.

137
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,840
I think when we consciously take a
breath and slow down at demonstrates

138
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,450
like confidence and mastery of our
craft,

139
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,460
which I know is a very pretentious thing
to say,

140
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:29,180
but that's what I used to say to people
when I taught them in their improv

141
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,910
acting classes,
which can be kind of pretentious.

142
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:35,540
So that's the main thing is remember
what we do is impressive.

143
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,570
We don't need to speed through it
because they're going to be blown away

144
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:40,040
as long as we do it with integrity.
