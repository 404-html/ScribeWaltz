1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,380
I routinely point out that we could
eliminate 80% of all chronic disease by

2
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:15,460
using what we know.
And we don't do that.

3
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,020
We really bogged down in bickering about
do we know what we know and,

4
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,760
and is this part of what we know more
important than that part of what we know

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,730
and in no place is that a bigger problem
than diet.

6
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,210
There's obviously a lot of money to be
made from confusion.

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,460
Uh,
some years ago I worked on air for Good

8
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:38,461
Morning America and I saw firsthand that
there really is invested interest in tv

9
00:00:39,881 --> 00:00:43,090
and the median propagating constant
change.

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,940
If you say the same thing about diet on
air,

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,570
enough times in a row,
people lose interest in your dietary

12
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:51,580
segments.
If you say something different every

13
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:54,070
time,
it's always interesting to an end

14
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:57,340
tomorrow for a new answer.
So the media are in on it.

15
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,060
The fad diet authors are in on it.
Uh,

16
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,110
basically a lot of people who just think
that their view of the truth through a

17
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:07,900
particular tunnel is the only truth are
in on it.

18
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,290
But the result is we squander the
opportunity to use what we know because

19
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:16,750
we bogged down in debate about what we
don't know quite so well.

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,500
So having completely lost my patients
for the status quo decided to do

21
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:24,110
something about this.
And,

22
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:28,720
and it's really challenging now because
there was a time not all that long ago

23
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,420
when a single voice could rise above the
den.

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,890
For example about doctor coop when he
was surgeon general or Benjamin spock

25
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:38,650
and the influence that he had on parents
raising young children.

26
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,420
But that era is gone because we live in
the age of the blogosphere in cyberspace

27
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:48,010
and everybody's got a microphone and,
and there's just this incredible amount

28
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:48,844
of static.

29
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,850
And at the end of it all the answer to
the question,

30
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:56,230
can we say what diet is best for health?
And by health we mean longevity,

31
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:57,550
vitality,
weight control,

32
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:02,551
all the good stuff that we all want.
The answer is absolutely no.

33
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,300
If what we mean is a very specific
prescriptive,

34
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,550
my diet can beat your diet.
So,

35
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,590
you know,
can we say whether the best

36
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:14,980
Mediterranean diet is better than the
best Vegan Diet?

37
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:17,950
Or if that's better than the best Palio
Diet for human health?

38
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,030
The answer is no.
If what we mean though by can we say

39
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:26,140
what diet is best for health is a basic
theme of optimal living.

40
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:31,141
Then the answer is a categorical yes.
It's incredibly clear from incredibly

41
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:35,140
voluminous,
incredibly consistent literature all

42
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:37,000
around the world.
Diverse populations,

43
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:40,330
diverse methods,
observational epidemiology where you

44
00:02:40,331 --> 00:02:44,170
just watch and see what happens.
Intervention trials where you assigned

45
00:02:44,171 --> 00:02:44,860
people to die.

46
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,860
It's randomized control trials and real
world experience with large populations

47
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:54,190
like the blue zones and frankly Michael
Paul and pretty much nailed this one.

48
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,180
Eat Food not too much,
mostly plants that really captures the

49
00:02:58,181 --> 00:03:02,440
essence of all the world's diets that
are associated with good health

50
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:05,110
outcomes.
And when I wrote about this with my

51
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:08,890
colleague Frank Hugh from Harvard,
we said wholesome foods in sensible

52
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,560
combinations,
and then to put a little meat on the

53
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:15,100
bones is it were wholesome foods means
vegetables,

54
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,050
fruits,
whole grains,

55
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,250
beans,
lentils,

56
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:19,420
nuts,
seeds,

57
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,490
whether without everything else you want
to eat.

58
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:22,630
Fish,
eat fish.

59
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,110
You won't eat seafood.
He'd seafood.

60
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,460
You want to eat some lean meat?
Do you want to eat eggs?

61
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,960
Do you want to eat dairy?
Do,

62
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:32,020
but the bulk of your diet should be
vegetables,

63
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:33,190
fruits,
whole grains,

64
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:33,911
beans,
lentils,

65
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:37,660
nuts and seeds.
This is true all around the world where

66
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:38,740
people do the best.

67
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,590
It's true in the Mediterranean where the
diets or high fat,

68
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,600
but the fat is coming from nuts,
seeds,

69
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,680
olives,
avocado,

70
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,170
olive oil.
It's true in the Far East where the

71
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:50,350
diets are low fat because there's lots
of vegetables,

72
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,130
grains,
and less of the nuts and the avocado.

73
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,310
And frankly it's true of diets as
diverse as Vegan and Paleo people who

74
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:04,480
really know what they're doing with the
palio diet are eating a wide variety of

75
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:06,670
plants,
preferably wild plants,

76
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:10,090
but not necessarily and lean meat,
preferably game.

77
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,700
So it's real food,
not too much.

78
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:17,110
And it is mostly plants.
And a Vegan diet is a slightly wider

79
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:20,140
variety of plant foods without the meat,
but they're actually more alike than

80
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:23,950
different.
So there really is incredible clarity

81
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:25,900
about the fundamentals of healthy
eating.

82
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,470
And I think really the big issue for all
of us is focusing our efforts on making

83
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,050
the fundamentals of that.

84
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,610
Dietary pattern more accessible in our
culture and allowing for people to

85
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:43,540
choose the variant on that theme that
works best for them.

86
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,550
So you need to eat well.
Even in a world that keeps running on

87
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:49,180
Dunkin,
you need to eat well and feed your

88
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:52,900
children well in a world that market's
multicolored marshmallows as part of a

89
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:55,930
complete breakfast,
you need to be physically active in a

90
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:59,470
world that gives you no time for
exercise and gives you more and more

91
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:01,800
technology to do everything that muscles
used to do.

92
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,200
So the theme of healthy eating,
unbelievably clear,

93
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,160
this specific claims about my diet can
beat your diet,

94
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,100
all false,
all somebody trying to sell you

95
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:14,440
something,
step away from your credit card and

96
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:15,274
nobody will get hurt.

97
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:19,260
Okay.
