1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,600
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,520
nuclear power nuclear power that we have
now,

3
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:14,920
it's called second generation nuclear
power.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,160
Um,
it's um,

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,240
it's a comparable in cost to coal.
Once you have the nuclear power plant,

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,840
then the fuel is very inexpensive,
so nuclear power is quite inexpensive,

7
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,650
but it's difficult in the United States
to get a nuclear power plant and build

8
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,200
and it takes so many years that it
drives the cost up.

9
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,720
So now in England they've realized that
they will need to have nuclear power in

10
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:50,110
the future,
so they've put a limit once a government

11
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:53,830
commission decides on where the power
plants will be built,

12
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,390
the public will have one year to object
to this and possibly get some changes,

13
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,650
but they can't drag it out six or seven
years the way it happens in the United

14
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,980
States because that drives up the price
tremendously.

15
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,580
And there's also the possibility for
fourth generation nuclear power.

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,520
That's a technology which allows you to
burn all of the nuclear fuel.

17
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,300
Presently,
nuclear power plants burn less than one

18
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:25,540
percent of the energy in the nuclear
fuel.

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,440
Fourth generation nuclear power allows
the neutrons to move faster so they can

20
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:36,601
burn all of the fuel and furthermore it
can burn nuclear waste so it can solve

21
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,860
the nuclear waste problem,
and the United States is still the

22
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:49,801
technology leader in fourth generation
nuclear power in 1994 Argonne National

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,740
Laboratory now called Idaho National
Laboratory was ready to build a fourth

24
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:01,510
generation nuclear power plant,
but the Clinton Gore administration

25
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:06,511
canceled that research because of the
anti nuclear sentiments in the

26
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,210
Democratic Party,
what?

27
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,440
Well,
we are still have the best expertise in

28
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:17,650
that technology and we should develop it
because it's something that we could

29
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:19,390
also sell to China,
India,

30
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:21,340
because they're going to need nuclear
power.

31
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,640
They don't are not going to be able to
get all of their energy from the sun and

32
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:25,474
from the wind.

33
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,670
The most effective one is energy
efficiency.

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,160
We waste a lot of our energy.
We can get vehicles that get more miles

35
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:41,090
per gallon there.
There are many ways to improve energy

36
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:42,740
efficiency.
In fact,

37
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,550
some states are twice as efficient as
other states.

38
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:51,500
Just because fossil fuels were so cheap,
we just didn't pay attention to how

39
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:54,050
effectively we were using them,
but in addition,

40
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:56,180
they're renewable energies,
solar energy,

41
00:02:56,181 --> 00:03:01,181
wind energy,
and I think that nuclear power has to be

42
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:06,671
part of the solution because at this
time it's the only alternative to coal

43
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,140
for baseload electrical power,
and we do now have the technology for a

44
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:20,261
much safer and more efficient nuclear
power as compared to the old versions

45
00:03:21,321 --> 00:03:23,330
that were used in the past several
decades.
