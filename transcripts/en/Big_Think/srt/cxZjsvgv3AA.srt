1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,980
Mm,

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,890
well they did a show called the eyes of
Nye

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,510
companies like Monsanto had patents on
genes and people were questioning

4
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:18,150
whether or not that was ethical.
Also,

5
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:22,350
there was this overarching idea that we
have enough food,

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,850
we just can't distribute it properly,
and the reason people are starving in

7
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:31,851
the world is there's enough food.
In my concern was the ecosystem.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,200
The sisters say,
you can know each organism very well and

9
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:41,490
by no I mean you can know it's the
sequence of its genes and you can grow

10
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:44,700
it in isolation and refuges and see how
it performs.

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,960
This term had crops.
Now,

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,670
there would be no need to experiment
with the ecosystem even though you can

13
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:56,430
know the individual crop plant,
you don't know what it would do.

14
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,970
One,
it's around butterflies or bees or birds

15
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:04,110
or other pollinators or some virus we
haven't discovered yet.

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,870
Since then,
a couple of things.

17
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,390
Three things have happened to my way of
thinking.

18
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,083
The,
uh,

19
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,210
the least significant may be that we can
now ask,

20
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:23,421
say genes 10 million.
This is to say no.

21
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,600
One hundred million,
10 to the eighth time's faster than we

22
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:32,601
could 15 or 20 years ago.
The DNA sequencing machines are so

23
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:36,780
sophisticated,
you can actually simulate what would

24
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:41,781
happen if this virus comes in or that
gene is introduced from a vector or an

25
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:47,190
insect vector or what have you.
That's the first thing that you can make

26
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:52,191
predictions about how plants will grow
based on their genes very accurately,

27
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,480
much more so than you could a couple of
decades ago.

28
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,600
The second thing is there are seven
point 3 billion people in the world

29
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,130
right now,
early in the 20,

30
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,420
20,
first century.

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,960
By the middle of the 21st century.
This is going to be 9 billion.

32
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,920
There might even be 10 billion people.
So those people are going to have to be

33
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,800
fed.
And sure enough,

34
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,360
uh,
the way to do that is almost certainly

35
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:23,190
with genetically modified crops,
which are much more productive than they

36
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:25,530
used to be.
And then from a historic standpoint,

37
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,830
humans have always hybridized crops,
but now a humans are hybridizing them

38
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,840
from a genetic standpoint,
not just by combining sexually,

39
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,170
uh,
crops of desirable traits.

40
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,350
And the third thing that was very
compelling to me as a scientist is we've

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,000
discovered,
and maybe everybody knew this except me,

42
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,960
and I'm the first one that we've
discovered that genes are introduced

43
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:56,961
between species naturally.
And the paper that really got to me was

44
00:02:57,031 --> 00:03:01,630
the one about sweet potatoes.
So sweet potatoes became sweet potatoes

45
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:06,631
because something like a virus infected
the sweet potatoes and changed their

46
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:11,410
genes.
And then humans cultivated those gene

47
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:12,850
changed potatoes.

48
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,840
And so without this introduction of
inter species between species genetic

49
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,730
transfer,
this wouldn't have happened.

50
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,090
So this,
these three things,

51
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,250
the ecosystem concern,
the rate at which we can ask,

52
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,710
say genes,
the number of people that are going to

53
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:35,050
have to be fed.
That's the second one.

54
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,450
And the third one is it happens
naturally anyway.

55
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,660
Uh,
these three things have changed my point

56
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:44,590
of view about genetically modified foods
and the regulations for them are

57
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:49,570
actually quite robust.
You can't just go creating a crop plant

58
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:53,950
that's going to be deleterious to the
farming system along with this,

59
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:58,380
everybody first to admit,
uh,

60
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,900
the idea that you can,
that you can patent genes seems

61
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,560
troubling.
But there's a little bit,

62
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,530
there's a lot to it that's very
reasonable.

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,400
Companies like pioneer seed company
that's part of dupont and the be mixed

64
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:19,810
feelings.
Monsanto,

65
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,860
they spend a lot of money,
a huge fraction of their resources on

66
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,060
developing these plants.

67
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,000
And recently the patented soybean
expire.

68
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,900
The patent expired.
So soybeans are out now.

69
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,550
So,
okay,

70
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,000
so if you want to grow those soybeans,
now you can.

71
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,050
And uh,
farmers do make contracts to grow those

72
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:46,051
plants because they grow better.
So what we can imagine a future where

73
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:51,781
plants are tuned to grow in very moist
soils at the bottom of the hill where

74
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:55,780
the water runs down very dry soils at
the top of the hill where the water

75
00:04:55,781 --> 00:05:00,781
drains away quickly and in between.
And the plants that would be planted,

76
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:05,290
the crop plants that will be planted
would vary like meter to meter,

77
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,170
certainly old crow across the farm
field.

78
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:11,830
They would vary from one end to the
other and they would be planted

79
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,820
electronically using global positioning
from outer space.

80
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:18,070
And this will enable people to feed the
world.

81
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,720
So,
uh,

82
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:23,690
I used to be against genetically
modified foods just for,

83
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,170
from the cautionary principle,
you don't know what you're doing in the

84
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:29,710
ecosystem.
So be careful now I am for genetically

85
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:33,640
modified foods because we have so much
more science behind it than we did even

86
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:34,360
20 years ago.
