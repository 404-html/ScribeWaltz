1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:07,980
What are we doing right?

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,550
The key thing the irs is doing wrong in
terms of energy policy overall,

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,220
I think he's letting congress mandate
foolish,

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,480
foolish,
uh,

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,210
legislation like the ethanol scam,
the congress in,

6
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:29,211
in December of 2007 passed the energy
independence and security act of 2007

7
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:33,930
and in doing so mandated the production
of 36 billion gallons of ethanol by

8
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:36,240
2022.
It is not going to happen.

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,291
Um,
this,

10
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:41,280
I mean that what they have done is
mandate the creation of a huge amount of

11
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:43,710
motor fuel that the market cannot
supply.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,850
But what is also happening is that they
are increasing demand for corn and

13
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:51,030
thereby and therefore other grains and
it's causing enormous amounts of

14
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:54,480
inflation in food prices and it's
hurting consumers all over the country.

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,770
So I think what the u s has been doing
wrong with regard to energy policy is

16
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:03,090
allowing Congress to meddle too much in
the market and mandate certain solutions

17
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:05,190
that are not economic and are not
helpful.

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,950
Um,
what is the US doing?

19
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:08,784
Right?
Uh,

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,010
you know,
I don't have to think about that one

21
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,520
because there are no,
there are no answers that come to mind.

22
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,170
I think that we've,
we've really,

23
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:17,940
uh,
uh,

24
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,570
the mistake that we are making as well,
in addition to the ethanol is relying on

25
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:25,350
militarism.
The U S has really,

26
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,480
since the 1970s,
in particular,

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,540
had an approach to energy security that,
uh,

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,600
and that requires wrongly over
militarization of the Persian Gulf,

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,650
which I think has been a very,
had very deleterious effects on the u s

30
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,690
uh,
the second Iraq war was,

31
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,110
no matter how you slice it,
was in fact about controlling the flow

32
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:50,220
of oil out of Iraq and resting the
control of Iraqi oil from Saddam

33
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,660
Hussein.
Meanwhile,

34
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,000
other countries around the world have,
uh,

35
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,560
have,
have turned to the marketplace.

36
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,230
They are not using militarism as a way
to,

37
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,280
uh,
trying to assure energy supply and they

38
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,780
are thriving and we're going bankrupt.

39
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,630
Okay.
