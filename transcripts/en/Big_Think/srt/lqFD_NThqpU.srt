1
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,300
In the sense that everyone understands
what it is and there's no one who's

2
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:17,760
hasn't been touched in some way.
A mother,

3
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:18,930
a daughter,
a sister,

4
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:20,940
a friend.
We're not starting with,

5
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:24,480
let me tell you what breast cancer is.
Everyone knows about it.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,510
It's come out of the closet.
There's no stigma.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,270
It's very different from what it was
when Evelyn started.

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,690
And I think everyone wants to be
supportive either because they've had a

9
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:36,990
personal experience or almost for an
insurance policy.

10
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:39,510
If I do support it,
then maybe I won't have that personal

11
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:43,230
experience.
So it's an easy subject to broach with

12
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:46,250
people and people are incredibly
responsive.

13
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,563
Mostly

14
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,470
the money that we have raised,
we have waste in the United States

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,720
though.
We have disbursed it internationally.

16
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,520
So we have added on grantees now in
Canada,

17
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,750
France,
Belgium,

18
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:06,890
Spain,
the UK,

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,480
Italy,
the Middle East and Latin America.

20
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:12,850
For the most part,
we're still deriving the bulk of our

21
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:14,860
money in the United States.
Um,

22
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,710
though we've had some wonderful help
from companies and,

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,370
and estee lauder up in Canada.
Um,

24
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,570
and some programs in the UK for the most
part,

25
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:27,571
the money has been derived here because
the tax incentives for philanthropy that

26
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,430
existed in u s don't exist elsewhere.

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,820
No.

28
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,350
You know,
the amount of money is,

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,200
has,
has at the very best stayed flat.

30
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,540
And if you factor in inflation,
it's decreased.

31
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,070
The whole NCI budget for cancer is 5
billion,

32
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,310
which may sound like a lot,
but when you look at what the tobacco

33
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:56,110
industry spends about 15 billion
advertising cigarettes to teenagers or

34
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,350
the pet food industry spends about 14
billion advertising pet food.

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,670
Um,
it's a small drop in the bucket in all

36
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:07,240
about 11 billion is spent on cancer
research across the NCI,

37
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:10,570
the National Cancer Institute,
pharmaceuticals and private

38
00:02:10,571 --> 00:02:13,300
organizations like the Breast Cancer
Research Foundation.

39
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,890
So it's not a lot of money in the
federal budget has certainly diminished,

40
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:19,930
if anything.
And,

41
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:25,350
and the pity is that there has never
been a moment in time when knowledge,

42
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:28,300
scientific knowledge is advancing at
such a rapid clip.

43
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,300
It's a hungry animal.
So that if you could feed it,

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,400
the answers will come more.
Click quickly.

45
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,700
Dr. Larry Norton at Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center,

46
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:40,690
who is our scientific advisor and has
been since the inception of the

47
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:43,900
foundation,
says truly the only thing that stands

48
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:45,760
between today and it is money.

49
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,890
Tough question.
I don't what inspires the herb.

50
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:55,340
Kent,
if I knew the answer,

51
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,730
I'd be,
I'd be very smart.

52
00:02:58,731 --> 00:03:01,410
I don't what inspires the government.
Um,

53
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,090
but obviously there have been other
calls on the,

54
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,380
the federal dollar as you know,
um,

55
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,580
the war and other things.
And one can only hope that under new

56
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:12,760
leadership there might be an enrichment
of the federal coffers.

57
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,280
Because right now if you are a
researcher,

58
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,420
you spent half the year writing a
federal grant and you have only a slim

59
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:21,790
percentage of chance that that will get
funded.

60
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,210
Only 8% of approved grants actually get
funded.

61
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:27,160
And the pity is then there's a brain
drain.

62
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:29,320
People are actually leaving the field in
droves.

63
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,350
They get this tremendous education.
They have the vision,

64
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,620
they have the drive.
But if they can't get the dollars to

65
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:38,680
move their research forward,
they can't pursue what they've been

66
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:39,550
trained to do.

67
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,930
We try to put dollars private dollars in
the hands of researchers who have new

68
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:48,430
ideas often to help them get the base
data that will make them competitor for

69
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:50,890
the limited federal dollars.
It's like a chicken and egg.

70
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,650
You can't compete for the dollars until
you have the data.

71
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:58,630
You almost have to finish your research
or know the answer before you can start.

72
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:02,170
So an organization like ours plays a
critical function,

73
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,190
often teen people up to compete for the
limited dollars and often moving

74
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:09,650
research forward that might otherwise
language for decades can.

75
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,710
At the end of the day,
Keith was wives

76
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,950
[inaudible]

77
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,150
my tin cuff.
And where you and where you contribute?

78
00:04:20,151 --> 00:04:22,340
Well first of all,
because I know we're on the side of the

79
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:24,020
angels,
I know we're doing good.

80
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,350
I know we're making a difference.
Um,

81
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,210
I'm not asking for myself.
People always say to me,

82
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:31,250
what's the key to being a good
fundraiser?

83
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,720
It's being able to ask in a way that
people can say no,

84
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:40,721
and the doors open for you to come back.
It's asking in a collaborative fashion.

85
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,060
Um,
and so how has our success come about?

86
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,820
We're very attentive to retaining our
donors,

87
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,610
cultivating our donors,
stewarding rs owners,

88
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:54,170
and growing the average gift size and
was equally as [inaudible] in acquiring

89
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:57,020
new donors.
And if you do both and you don't have a

90
00:04:57,021 --> 00:05:01,220
drain at one side and you're new and,
and you never grow because your new one

91
00:05:01,221 --> 00:05:04,520
simply replace.
We're very dedicated across the board.

92
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,460
I like asking for money,
not for myself,

93
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,010
but this is for a good cause.
I like doing,

94
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:11,930
it fires me up.
And Evelyn Lauder,

95
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:14,240
who is the founder and chairman of the
foundation,

96
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:17,690
is as,
as dog in and dedicated as I am.

97
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:20,840
She's also smart,
appreciative,

98
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,860
and a wonderful colleague.
So it's very motivational when you work

99
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:28,550
for somebody whose heart and soul into
this with you and a partner,

100
00:05:28,551 --> 00:05:31,740
a true partner.
And we do it together with zeal and with

101
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,750
success in your job.

102
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,560
[inaudible].
