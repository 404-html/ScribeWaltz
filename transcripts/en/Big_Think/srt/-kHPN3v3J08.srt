1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,260
With next generation technologies,
we have the ability to replace the

2
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:15,530
petroleum we use today in our vehicles
with advanced biofuels.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,270
Those technologies require years to
develop and literally hundreds of

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,880
millions of dollars of investment in
order for that investment to occur.

5
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,040
In order for that R and d to actually
happen,

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,510
there needs to be a conventional
biofuels industry from which to evolve.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,130
Today's conventional biofuels industry
provides exactly that platform and we

8
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:37,970
anticipate over the next decade that
that transformation will occur and that

9
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,610
next generation,
sustainable biofuels will become the

10
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:41,930
norm rather than the exception.
