1
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,450
Well,
why does that all the people are

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,373
automatically,

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,430
which is not true,
only about 5% of older people,

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,950
for example,
or a nursing obs with any kind of a

5
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,880
dementia or Alzheimer's disease.
The idea that they're unproductive and

6
00:00:21,881 --> 00:00:25,660
can't be successful.
The workforce who may know their numbers

7
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:28,000
of them that are,
and they're very dependable and

8
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,850
hardworking people in the workforce,
the idea,

9
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:33,250
they're all sexless,
which is also not true.

10
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,960
They have desire,
capability and satisfaction unless have

11
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:42,961
a disease of some sort.
And even those who are now increasingly

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,970
treatable,
they're still capable of learning.

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,560
And a,
you know,

14
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:49,360
even,
you know,

15
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:54,361
right now they're already 74,007 areas.
That means people over 100 years of age

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,890
and they have remained independent and
capable of through their 90 50 year.

17
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,443
So,
uh,

18
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,230
there was no way to assume that people
are not able to learn just because

19
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,120
they're getting older.
Well,

20
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:10,730
it's built into the central nervous
system and it's simply hasn't played out

21
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:14,140
as yet.
I suppose he had the 200 year old

22
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:16,150
person.
Maybe they would have trouble,

23
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,370
but we don't know that yet.

24
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,040
Well,
I think one of the great ways to do it

25
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:30,100
is to learn something totally different,
like a new language,

26
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,370
a musical instrument,
because had rarely challenged as the

27
00:01:33,371 --> 00:01:38,371
brain and learning more of the same,
like continue to do crossword puzzles

28
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:42,400
might be okay,
but it's not as desirable or as

29
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:45,070
powerful.
A stimulant to the central nervous

30
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:48,820
system is a brand new challenge,
like a new language or a musical

31
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:50,440
instrument.
Well,

32
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:53,980
the capacity for learning new things,
vocabulary,

33
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:58,981
building a judge Matt actually grows
with age of speed changes.

34
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:02,890
That is,
you're not as quick and responding to a

35
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:03,724
stimulus.

36
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:07,890
Oh.
