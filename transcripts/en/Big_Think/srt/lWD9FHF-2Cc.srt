1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,943
Yeah,

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:15,070
that we had a big party and lab had a
lot of reporters came to get comments

3
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:17,840
from people at Harvard.
Um,

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,760
I think the,
I'm really excited and because at

5
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:26,250
Harvard,
Harvard has a lot of private funding and

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,500
so it's so some labs have projects that
are less dependent on federal funding,

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,830
but I think that lots of people in the
US,

8
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:38,370
there's thousands of universities,
many of which are very bright people

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,430
trying to advance stem cell research and
that blockading federal money to those

10
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:49,350
lab of toys.
Villi hurts us a lot because we can't

11
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:54,130
hope to bring queues into market.
I think by just having pilot funding to

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,440
universities and corporate funding for
pharmaceuticals and that I'm really

13
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:03,300
excited now that our current president
is looking forward to trying to um,

14
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,560
jumpstart stem cell research and
biomedical research as whole.

15
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:08,460
And I think that

16
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,740
as this money gets spread around the
country,

17
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:16,910
that we will see a lot of people from
different universities and institutions

18
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:19,550
publishing a lot of good work that's
really going to move us forward.

19
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:21,920
I'm really excited that this is going
on.

20
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,250
I think that while the first FDA trials,
clinical trials for stamps was a going

21
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:31,900
on now with spinal cord injury,
um,

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,510
that many of my colleagues and friends
and I agree that it will be decades

23
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:38,640
before this becomes a more prevalent
trend.

24
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,720
And I think that looking at the current,
um,

25
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,120
current drugs for pharmaceutical
companies,

26
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,450
it can take maybe on a scale of 10 years
and a billion dollars to get a drug all

27
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:55,890
the way to market.
And so I think that means that for the

28
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:58,560
stem cell studies are being done it now
in mice,

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,590
that it will take at least at the very
minimum,

30
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,770
a decade,
much more to be able to get those to

31
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:05,604
humans.

32
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,880
I think the fact is we're so comfortable
with taking pills or taking shots,

33
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,720
but
when gene therapy came around,

34
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:15,210
no one was too excited about putting
viruses into the body.

35
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,010
And I think that right now people aren't
too thrilled about putting stem cells

36
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:22,560
with stem cell derived cells into
someone's body.

37
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,090
And I think that
it's really important that we try to

38
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,630
take this slow and be careful and make
sure that nothing that we can

39
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:31,920
ultimately,
hi a person,

40
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,620
that these stem cells won't hurt anyone.
And I think it definitely will take

41
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,100
decades.
And I guess maybe as my generation gets

42
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:43,820
older,
we'll see stem cells come around because

43
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,200
there's a big interest in them and lots
of people interested.

44
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,710
But I think that it's something in the
near foreseeable future but not but

45
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:55,380
definitely not now.
And that the future was definitely going

46
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:57,300
to bring a lot.
And I'm really excited to see how it.
