1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,060
I surely hope so.
I mean,

2
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:09,691
it's,
it's a,

3
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:12,170
it's inevitable that change will come.
Uh,

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,780
I hope it comes soon enough and,
uh,

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,750
and that the Cubans end up being free
enough because right now we're going to

6
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:20,610
see,
it'd be tough for them to just suddenly

7
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:21,900
be thrown into,
you know,

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,590
a whole new world that they don't know.
So was going to have to happen little by

9
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:26,560
little.
Uh,

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,850
but I do hope that they do that they do
experience freedom.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,540
And that's when I would love to perform
there in a day where I don't have to ask

12
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:37,500
the government permission or have
anybody take repressive measures about

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,050
in any of our me,
against the audience,

14
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:42,030
against anyone.
And I would need that.

15
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:43,920
I would need them to be completely free.
It's happening.

16
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:46,890
It's gonna happen.
It's just for none of us.

17
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:49,620
It's soon enough,
but as long as it's in the best way for

18
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:49,970
them.
