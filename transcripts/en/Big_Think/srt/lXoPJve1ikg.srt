1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,250
I think plants present an opportunity
for people to look closely at something

2
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:21,210
and get invested in something that's
truly very much outside of themselves.

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,330
Plants are not like us and the more you
study plants,

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,360
the more different and deep ways you see
that they are not like us.

5
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,130
All the important things that we do from
how we

6
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,930
move around to how we reproduce to how
we

7
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,130
react to the sun.
Any human activity you could point to,

8
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,440
hey,

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,440
you're going to see something very
different in plants and the more you

10
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:04,690
know about how plants function and the
more you watch them function and test

11
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:08,860
their functioning,
the more deeply you understand how

12
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:12,790
different they are.
I think that's useful because I think

13
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,460
people have a need to transcend
themselves.

14
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,620
And I know that when I get bogged down
in,

15
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,640
um,
the dysfunctionalities of how people

16
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:25,660
treat each other and conflicts between
men and women and,

17
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,750
and money problems in science and all
this kind of thing that I can,

18
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,090
uh,
take some comfort and joy and

19
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,080
transcending what seemed like very small
scale human noise.

20
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,730
And look at
the differences and a life form.

21
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:50,710
That's been successfully occupying the
planet for 400 million years,

22
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:56,070
so quite frankly,
I get a lot of joy and comfort and

23
00:01:56,831 --> 00:01:59,980
happiness from considering these things.
I mean,

24
00:01:59,981 --> 00:02:02,440
I think that's the main reason to do
sciences,

25
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,090
that it feeds the soul.

26
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,370
I think that,
and I see this in students year after

27
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,950
year,
that the more you know about the world,

28
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:16,951
the more you feel like you're part of it
and it's like nothing else.

29
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:22,240
You know,
you teach somebody not to just walk by a

30
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:24,070
tree but to look up at it and say,
Yep,

31
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:29,130
that one's deciduous and that one's
evergreen and that one is going to lose

32
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:33,910
it sleeves this fall,
but that one's going to stay green.

33
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,810
Just very basic things like that and you
see people sense of self and self esteem

34
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:45,511
rise and all of a sudden they know
something about the world that they

35
00:02:45,671 --> 00:02:50,671
journey through and it makes them a
little bit bigger as a person and that's

36
00:02:55,781 --> 00:03:00,781
really a wonderful thing to watch in
students and to be able to facilitate.

37
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:08,070
So I think
we should plant trees not to save trees.

38
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:14,611
I think planning a tree is
not unlikely to be a method you use to

39
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:22,921
save yourself and to find meaning and
something that will be with you and grow

40
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:25,564
with you

41
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,620
and be something you can come back to
and contrast your own life with.

42
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,650
I'm very influenced by some research
that came out,

43
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:44,651
I think in the eighties that compared
retention during learning.

44
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,700
And I remember very strongly that the
main result of that was the,

45
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,510
the larger,
the number of senses that you invoked if

46
00:03:56,511 --> 00:04:00,020
you were touching something,
if you were writing and listening and

47
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:04,280
watching and even smelling something or
tasting,

48
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:07,160
you know,
the more senses that you could engage

49
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:12,161
during learning the more effectively
that information was integrated into the

50
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:16,160
person and learned,
I think with digital media,

51
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:19,430
we're very,
very strongly going towards a medium

52
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:22,940
that is visual only.
I mean,

53
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:27,050
you do hear the message,
etc. But I worry that it's a passive

54
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:32,051
stance just in terms of using the five
senses and that,

55
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,100
um,
you can't learn passively.

56
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,420
I think the Best learning is done with
active manipulatIon.

57
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,200
Um,
and we need to be able to work with our

58
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,430
hands.
you know,

59
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:51,431
it's not just about using our brains.
I mean,

60
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:55,940
eventually we have to manipulate the
world with our hands in order to make

61
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,550
tangible change,
right?

62
00:04:58,551 --> 00:04:59,610
And,
um,

63
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,420
students need practice with that.
Kids need practice with that.

64
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:06,140
We need to do that in life.
And uh,

65
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,580
for better or worse,
you know,

66
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:10,370
our screen experiences will never,
never give us that.

67
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,380
It's very important to put children in
an environment where they can take

68
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,200
things apart,
uh,

69
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,710
where they can break things and then
learn to fix them where they can trust

70
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:26,711
their hands and know
their capacity to manipulate objects.

71
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:36,641
And I see that as a much more active
interaction than what the newer types of

72
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:43,010
technology offer as they supply
learning.

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,980
So,
you know,

74
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,170
I'm not anti
screen,

75
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,250
et cetera,
but I do worry that the hours we spend

76
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:58,870
that way are replacing some of the
things that are going to be important.
