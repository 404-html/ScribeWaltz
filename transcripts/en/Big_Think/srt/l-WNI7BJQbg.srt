1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,183
Mm,

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,830
when it comes to body language,
it's never an exact art and the things

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,780
I'm going to suggest that all
guidelines,

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,120
um,
but that said,

5
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:18,790
there are some certain things that as a
poker player,

6
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:23,410
I'll look for a.
and the most important thing is first of

7
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:25,720
all,
to get sort of a baseline of somebody.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,940
It's impossible to tell whether the
behavior someone's showing is meaningful

9
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:35,050
or not if you don't know how they
naturally behave.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,310
So the first thing I'll do when I sit
down at the table is look at what my

11
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:41,020
opponents are doing when they're not in
a hand,

12
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:43,650
you know,
are they naturally quite gregarious?

13
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:48,100
Are they confident when they interact
with the white dress or are they

14
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:50,950
naturally quite quiet and shy?
Um,

15
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,750
how do they,
how do they sit?

16
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:55,000
Are they,
are they naturally closed off,

17
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:57,340
are they very languishing,
that kind of thing.

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,430
And then once I've got an idea of that
baseline outside of a hand,

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,460
then I looked to see how they deviate
from that when they're actually in the

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,191
middle of playing or you know,
in a,

21
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,610
in a tense situation.
And in general,

22
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:13,240
what you want to look for in both poker,
but also when you have to say,

23
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:17,590
trying to figure out if someone's lying
is the comfort level.

24
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,360
Um,
if,

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,730
if there's sort of,
if they seem authentic,

26
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:25,330
like as a rule of thumb,
humans are actually quite good at

27
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:28,340
picking up a authenticity,
um,

28
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,080
or if someone's being disingenuous.
Uh,

29
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,130
so that's,
that's sort of the thing to look out

30
00:01:33,131 --> 00:01:34,900
for.
And they're all some like classic

31
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,470
behaviors that I've noticed people do at
the table where they'll,

32
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,610
um,
they'll sort of make a point of if,

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,370
if you see them suddenly making a point
of making themselves bigger,

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,740
you know,
like where they're naturally setting

35
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:50,500
like this and now they're sort of
puffing up a,

36
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:55,030
that's more often than not sort of false
confidence at that they're trying to

37
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,520
show,
um,

38
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,940
you know,
most people do try to stay very

39
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,950
constant.

40
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,520
So if you've noticed sort of a,
like you really do notice a behavior

41
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:09,220
particularly against someone who seems
to play quite regularly to,

42
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:11,890
chances are they're,
they're aware of their behavior.

43
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,510
So they're probably trying to mislead
you.

44
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,300
But another rule of thumb I like to
follow is the first thing you learn as a

45
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:21,530
kid,
usually when you lie,

46
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:22,364
it is,
Oh,

47
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,480
lawyers won't look you in the eye.
So what do pick what the kids do to

48
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:26,350
overcompensate.
They'll,

49
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,150
they'll look you in the eye.
Um,

50
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,410
and similarly people are very aware of
their faces and you know,

51
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,020
this part of their body,
if they're trying to be dishonest,

52
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,470
but what they're not thinking about is
the rest of their body.

53
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,390
So the lower down on the body that
you're looking at,

54
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:46,990
the more reliable the information is.
So if you think about when you were

55
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:49,160
excited about something,
generally speaking,

56
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:51,960
you will bounce around and,
and sort of,

57
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,410
you can't keep still.

58
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,810
And you know,
that's like,

59
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,560
we call it happy feet in poker,
the feet are often the most reliable to

60
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:04,561
look at on your opponent because they
might be completely stoic in their face,

61
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:08,380
but their feet are bouncing around.
It's usually a sign that they have a

62
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:10,300
really strong hand.
But similarly,

63
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:14,530
if they're sort of smiling and chatty,
but their feet all of a sudden sort of

64
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,590
tuck themselves around the table,
around the chair legs,

65
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,420
something's up there.
So,

66
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,640
uh,
as a rule of thumb,

67
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:26,200
look for the rest of someone else's body
more than their face.

68
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,000
Um,
if you're trying to figure out if

69
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:29,020
they're telling you the truth or not.

70
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,360
Mm.
