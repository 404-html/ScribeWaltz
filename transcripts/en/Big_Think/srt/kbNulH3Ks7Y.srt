1
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,820
With transformative technology and at
the transformative technology lab,

2
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:15,850
we're tracking 10 major areas of Trans
Tech and those 10 areas include things

3
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:22,781
like neurofeedback and biofeedback,
neurostim and bio stem.

4
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,500
Those are the ones that I think people
would think of the most.

5
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,890
A good example of that would be the Muse
headset by interacts on that measures

6
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:38,130
your eeg,
so measures your brain waves.

7
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,750
Another thing that's coming out is a
neuro stem.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,010
A good example of that would be a
company called Halo neuroscience,

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,600
and so it's a.
it's a.

10
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,900
it's a slight stimulation to the brain
that in their trials with elite

11
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:59,621
athletes,
they're showing people having big surges

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,380
in ability and so that's kind of
interesting.

13
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:08,381
There's another product called think
that sits on the forehead right here and

14
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:13,541
it stimulates the peripheral nerves and
short of it could replace a cup of

15
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:18,350
coffee so it sort of stimulates you and
wakes you up.

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,560
So there's a lot of focus on things that
are taking feedback from the body and

17
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:28,310
then stimulating the body.
And so it could be the body or the

18
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:31,850
brain.
One of the things that is coming is a

19
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:36,851
lot of vegas nerve stimulation and I'm
the on the medical side,

20
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,210
there's research that's recently come
out where people are really taking that

21
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:46,480
more seriously.
Um,

22
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,950
in addition,
some of the things that I think are

23
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:53,951
really cool is I'm really intrigued by
emotion recognition software,

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,480
whether that's through cameras that are
watching facial expressions eye or

25
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,670
through,
um,

26
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,940
or another example would be there's a
company called beyond verbal that just

27
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:13,460
off of the audio files can pick up human
emotion.

28
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,810
And you might think,
well,

29
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:16,580
you know,
sort of what's the use of that?

30
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:18,950
I know how I feel,
but it's actually,

31
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,670
if you think about it,
when everything in your house is smart,

32
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,180
you're really going to want to want it
to know if you're upset or sad or not.

33
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,220
You know,
if you're upset or not.

34
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:29,270
So,
you know,

35
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:33,230
I have a friend,
an older friend that I bought an Amazon

36
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,680
Echo for and she whispers around the
echo,

37
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:40,220
like it's a real person.
This is someone who's in there who's in

38
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:43,160
their seventies.
And so for people who are growing up in

39
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:46,340
smart houses,
which you know a lot of children today,

40
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,350
they won't even know a time where there
isn't a certain level of intelligence

41
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:56,330
that's baked into their environment.
We're going to want all these things to

42
00:02:56,331 --> 00:03:00,640
know how we feel.
I think that emotion recognition is

43
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,750
really interesting.
It's the thing that's captured my

44
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:09,220
imagination right now.
There's a lot of interest right now in

45
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:14,221
neuro stem and a lot of that is based on
a series of studies that were done by

46
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:20,461
Darpa where they were using slight
electrical stimulation and saw a

47
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:26,221
increase in task acquisition for people
in various roles in the military.

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,040
The one that's the most well known is
for the increase or the acceleration for

49
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:39,091
sharp shooters from novice to expert
with the application of a slight

50
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:42,280
electrical stimulation while they were
learning.

51
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,160
There's a lot of people who are really
interested in that.

52
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:48,700
There's actually a really large do it
yourself community around the world

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
where people are doing citizen
independent science really and do it

54
00:03:55,631 --> 00:04:00,631
yourself science and using various
levels of electrical currency on their

55
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:04,750
own brains.
And then sharing it in forums and

56
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:08,830
communicating about it.
People have been trying electrical

57
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,040
stimulation with physical task
acquisition,

58
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:17,070
also language tests acquisition.
It's one of those things that there's

59
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:20,120
products that are being based on it.
Um,

60
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,700
there's a whole category of things with
a called transcranial direct

61
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:27,820
stimulation.
And so there's a lot of products out

62
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:30,100
there on that.
Some of the brand names that you might

63
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:33,490
find would be focus is one.

64
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,790
Halo neuroscience is another,
the think product is another.

65
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,630
And so it's starting to have commercial
products for it.

66
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,300
Um,
there also was a,

67
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:51,340
as you can imagine,
there's a lot of the medical community

68
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:56,050
is a little concerned about it.
It's a good example of where people,

69
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:01,140
individuals are really sort of pushing
ahead of where the medical community is

70
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:02,580
on,
you know,

71
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,610
what's a good idea for what levels of
stimulation you should have,

72
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,470
how often and where,
you know,

73
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,870
what part of the,
of the brain that you try to stimulate

74
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:16,600
through the surface.
And so it's really,

75
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:20,830
it's a,
it's an interesting space and people are

76
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:21,970
pushing into it.
