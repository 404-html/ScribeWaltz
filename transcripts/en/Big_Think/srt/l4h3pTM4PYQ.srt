1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,550
Well,
I think that,

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,080
um,
you know,

3
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:17,081
there was a phase in human life that I
hope is getting over with where,

4
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:20,870
um,
leaders wanted to do the social

5
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:25,871
engineering where the idea of communism,
not the original idea of communism,

6
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:31,181
but the idea of Lenin Ism and Stalin Ism
was the state should control what you

7
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:36,110
are like state was more important than
the people and should form what the

8
00:00:36,111 --> 00:00:37,970
people are.
And a,

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,290
that has been a devastating hold
approach.

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,580
It was the basis of nazi-ism its basis
of communism.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,130
It's the basis,
uh,

12
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,240
Islamic fundamentalism.
And it's the opposite basis as our

13
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:55,340
founding founders and not just our
finders,

14
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:56,990
but going back to,
you know,

15
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:58,430
air saddle,
uh,

16
00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:02,450
and that human beings have these
attributes and we should allow the

17
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:06,650
flowering of human being and the state
is there to serve us.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,950
We're not there to serve the state.
And that's a very big deal.

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,350
And a,
it's a very big fundamental difference.

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,040
Whether first words of the constitution,
we,

21
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,810
the people,
the United States.

22
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,870
Now in these other philosophies,
it's we,

23
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:23,840
the state or the state does.
And then the people,

24
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:26,270
they form the people,
they make the people.

25
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,900
But that's a very debilitating
philosophy.

26
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:34,901
So that's generally what has been the
most important political fight in,

27
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,590
uh,
last century.
