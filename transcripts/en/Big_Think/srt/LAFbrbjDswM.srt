1
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,380
War changes people.
And this is something that we've known

2
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:13,380
since recorded history.
Um,

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,330
it's been spoken about in literature
throughout the ages.

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,960
It's kind of a brotherhood of combat
veterans.

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,100
And for many,
many years it stayed in the Brotherhood

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,940
and a lot of people came back from World
War Two.

7
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:31,670
Our fathers,
our grandfathers didn't talk about what

8
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:33,440
happened.
Um,

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,770
because nobody would understand what the
thing is that you're transformed inside.

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,470
You feel different.
Um,

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,830
you've seen things,
you've seen death,

12
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,230
you've see,
you've experienced,

13
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:51,920
you've tasted fear,
you've done things that you don't want

14
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:56,480
to talk about or you feel shouldn't be
talked about.

15
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,820
Um,
because it'll be too scary for people to

16
00:00:58,821 --> 00:00:59,654
understand.

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,580
Ptsd is one of the most common mental
health conditions in the United States.

18
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:14,220
I think it's,
that map might be the fourth most common

19
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:15,770
condition.
Um,

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,590
and that's because,
um,

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,480
trauma is so prevalent in our society.
About 25% of women experience

22
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:28,890
interpersonal sexual violence,
which is extraordinary.

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,590
There are accidents,
natural disasters,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,650
uh,
more than half of persons,

25
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,500
um,
will be exposed to at least one

26
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:41,520
traumatic event in their lives.
The way that I like to describe a

27
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:46,350
traumatic event is an event that kind of
divides your life into a before and

28
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:50,330
after,
like a watershed moment that really kind

29
00:01:50,331 --> 00:01:54,570
of changes the way you view the world.
Whether or not you get post traumatic

30
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:56,730
stress disorder,
um,

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,140
it's big Europe,
you're leading your life a certain way,

32
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:06,141
something very big happens and it
changes the way that you look at

33
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,220
yourself and you look at the world.
So those kind of events are certainly

34
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,270
transformative.

35
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,260
Um,
they certainly have long lasting marks

36
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,350
and one of those,
um,

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,480
effects of trauma exposure can be the
development of posttraumatic stress

38
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:27,480
disorder.
Imagine if you see danger everywhere and

39
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:31,860
that you're really worried for your
safety that is going to affect almost

40
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:36,861
every interaction that you have at work.
You're going to be more on edge,

41
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,020
more irritable.
It can get you into fights with

42
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:45,021
coworkers or with your employer.
The idea that you can't really

43
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:51,111
experience pleasure or that you have a
restricted range of emotions is going to

44
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:54,140
affect you mostly in,
um,

45
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,180
social and interpersonal domains.
A lot of marriages have been by PTSD.

46
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,650
Um,
the spouse often really wants to help

47
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,810
the affected person,
but they're used to a certain closeness

48
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:14,680
or intimacy that they find is now more
difficult to access.

49
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,530
The hallmark of ptsd is that the memory
of the event becomes haunting.

50
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,150
Um,
it kind of takes on a life of its own.

51
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,180
You start thinking about what happened
just out of the blue or in response to

52
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:38,820
triggers in the environment.
And what's so distressing about the

53
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:43,500
memory is not that you just have an
image or remember what happened.

54
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,920
You have the physiologic feeling of fear
or horror that you had when the event

55
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:55,401
was occurring in real time.
So it's not only a,

56
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,220
a visual or or verbal memory out there,
it is a physiologic memory and this can

57
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:06,660
happen while you're awake.
It can happen while you're asleep in the

58
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:10,020
form of your dreams.
People that have ptsd have trouble

59
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:14,640
experiencing pleasure and it's all about
trying to become small and not,

60
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,880
not allowing yourself to be affected by
the environment.

61
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,720
Um,
it also includes really changing the way

62
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:23,640
you view the world and yourself.

63
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,500
The world's a bad place.
Um,

64
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,700
you might feel guilty or worthless.
You might feel you're to blame for what

65
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:34,701
happened or others are to blame.
And finally there are symptoms that

66
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:39,771
reflect increased arousal.
So people that have ptsd are on edge,

67
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,450
um,
their body and brain chemistry is rigged

68
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,480
for danger and for experiencing threat
and being very,

69
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:55,260
very concerned about anything in the
environment that might threaten them.

70
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,800
So the symptoms in this category include
being highly reactive to startle

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,750
responses.
I'm scanning the environment for signs

72
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:11,160
of danger and not being able to
concentrate on being very irritable and

73
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:11,994
angry.

74
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,090
Well,
nobody's going to wave a magic wand and

75
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:23,060
say,
I'm going to cure you being being anthro

76
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,780
fairy dust on you.
I'm getting over.

77
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:30,781
Ptsd is going to require some hard work
on the part of trauma survivor.

78
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,930
And there's no getting around that.
Um,

79
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,160
it's,
it's work to look in the mirror and know

80
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,180
that there's some part of you that's
gone forever.

81
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,840
There's work trying to understand
exactly what has and hasn't changed and

82
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:53,890
what can happen next.
PTSD treatment can be very,

83
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:58,250
very successful.
And I've seen it do wonders for people.

84
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:03,251
I've seen people go from being extremely
symptomatic to having very low symptoms

85
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:09,320
for a very long period of time.
But it's not something someone does to

86
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:12,650
you.
It's not in a little pill box that you

87
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:17,651
just swallow with water.
It really involves confronting what has

88
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:22,961
happened and con and
we sometimes fill it so much easier to

89
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:27,170
just try to put it in the past,
try to avoid it,

90
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:29,450
try not to think about it,
try not to deal with it.

91
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,450
But if we open ourselves up to,
um,

92
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:39,910
perhaps even the benefits or the ways
that we can grow the opportunities

93
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,420
provided to us by having these unique
experiences,

94
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,570
um,
then you can get past that hurdle.
