1
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,870
My parents come from Bangladesh and both
of them are Muslims and we were raised

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,990
somewhat informally in that tradition,
uh,

3
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,730
for a variety of reasons.
A,

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,130
I say informal.
I mean we weren't observant in the sense

5
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:27,800
of going to some kind of religious
service on a very regular basis,

6
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,560
although certainly identified with in
this Broadway.

7
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:35,561
And I remember praying pretty regularly.
There are Ssris and you're supposed to

8
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:39,620
memorize them.
And I remember I was taking Arabic

9
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:43,190
lessons very briefly for maybe only a
couple of weeks and that I had an

10
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:44,890
argument with a tutor,
uh,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,890
about whether androids have souls.
I remember,

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,550
uh,
I didn't feel as though it was getting

13
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:53,060
very satisfactory answer regarding the
androids having souls question.

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,020
So I kind of shirked my duties in that
regard.

15
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:58,400
And then,
um,

16
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,200
I suppose had a kind of broad interest
in religion as a phenomenon and I think

17
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:07,880
that I identify with Muslim communities
in some broad sense,

18
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:12,230
but I'm not all that reflective about
religion per se.

19
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,050
I kind of recoiled against people who
sneer at religion,

20
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,270
uh,
in part because I have a lot of friends

21
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:19,430
who are devoutly religious and relatives
and what have you.

22
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,240
At the same time I think that there is
such a thing as a religious impulse

23
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:28,241
that's some people possess or don't
possess and I think that I have far more

24
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:32,210
possessed the spaceman who's kind of
visiting Earth,

25
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,400
uh,
impulse rather than the religious

26
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:35,740
impulse.
Um,

27
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,760
although I also have a kind of booster
richness that I think that some

28
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,920
religious people have,
but it happens not to apply to religion

29
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:45,170
per se.
So that's not necessarily a very good

30
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,670
answer to your question,
but that is my,

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,980
those are my kind of broad impressions
of religion.

32
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,410
Well,
I remember once I'm overhearing a

33
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:57,990
conversation in which a guy was asked,
where are you from?

34
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:59,880
And he said,
New Orleans.

35
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,460
And then the interlocutors proceeded
ask,

36
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,380
Oh,
what was that like?

37
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:06,030
And he said something to the effect of,
well,

38
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:07,770
what do you think?
It was like all of these people saying

39
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:10,440
y'all all the time.
He had this contempt for it and that

40
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:12,780
really turned my stomach.
I just recoiled against it and I thought

41
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:15,210
to myself,
if you have objections to where you're

42
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:18,030
from,
you share them with your friends who are

43
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:20,850
also from New Orleans.
You don't share them with outsiders and

44
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:23,130
you certainly don't express that kind of
contempt.

45
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,730
It just seemed really untoward.
And then some years later,

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,600
as you may recall,
Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and

47
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:32,090
the same guy,
um,

48
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,130
uh,
he proceeded to write a kind of moving,

49
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,070
you know,
pieces about the devastation of his

50
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:38,610
native city.

51
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,040
And I thought to myself,
this person that's beneath contempt.

52
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:41,461
And,
uh,

53
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,061
I just,
uh,

54
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,120
at a very,
very basic gut level thing that,

55
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:47,880
uh,
this is just not a morally praiseworthy

56
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:50,150
individual.
And so I guess I think that,

57
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:52,560
um,
when you're engaged with something,

58
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,410
um,
you should work to improve it to the

59
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:57,390
extent possible,
be constructive.

60
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,420
Don't allow your booster parishionist to
blind you to the kind of various foibles

61
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,100
and downsides of whatever it is that you
were associated with,

62
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,130
but do your best.
Act in good faith.

63
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,210
And you consider yourself kind of a
steward of this tradition that you're a

64
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:15,520
part of.
Whether voluntarily or involuntarily,

65
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,670
and in a way that's a little unfair
because shelby steele talks about the

66
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:24,610
totalitarianism of black identity,
the idea that no one is obligated to

67
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:27,910
identify with a certain thing and there
is a way in which I can see how that's

68
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:30,060
problematic and you know,
maybe if we could all be Rafe,

69
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,470
like beings who are free of those
associations,

70
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:35,140
that would be nice.
But that doesn't strike me as the world

71
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:37,330
and you know,
you're embedded in the context and being

72
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:40,360
respectful of that strikes me as
reasonable.
