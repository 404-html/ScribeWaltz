1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,540
In Our world view,
excellence equals design times,

2
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:06,630
culture.
So half the battle is getting the design

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:09,460
of the organization right.
And um,

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,880
these are things like,
you know,

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,410
choosing very strategically where to
excel and we're to underperform and that

6
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:18,600
that's a design function and you have to
make sure that the business model works

7
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,480
and then it can scale.
And then it's systematically setting

8
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:24,450
people up to perform.
The other half is,

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,150
is culture.
And you know,

10
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:31,110
one of the reasons that culture matters
so much in service organizations is that

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,140
we need our employees to,
um,

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,010
every day on the front lines make
decisions that are,

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,610
that end up defining the customer
experience in managing those employees.

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,120
The handbook only gets you so far,
you know,

15
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:47,610
you,
and part of that is because customers

16
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,680
are wildly,
wonderfully unpredictable.

17
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:52,590
You don't know on the front lines and
the service organization,

18
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:57,591
what's going to happen moment to moment
and culture tells you what to do where,

19
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,930
um,
when there isn't a policy or precedent.

20
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,850
And so it's a,
it's a hugely important asset in service

21
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:07,920
organizations.
So Southwest Airlines,

22
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,710
the reason we love it is that it's an,
it's in perhaps the worst industry of

23
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:14,140
all time.
So the industry has essentially

24
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,620
destroyed more value than it's created
since its inception.

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,010
And then there's southwest who's
profitable every year,

26
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,640
every year for one decade,
every year for another decade,

27
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:28,780
every year for another decade.
They do it by this beautiful elegance of

28
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:31,660
focus.
They are very comfortable saying,

29
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:33,490
we do this,
we don't do that.

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,760
Which means they have great strategy and
they're very great at delivering

31
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:39,070
excellence because they say,
we'll do these things well,

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,110
turnaround time,
being on time.

33
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,560
We'll do these things badly.
Go on board of Southwest Airlines flight

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,760
and ask someone for a full meal.
They have no shame,

35
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:51,370
no apology.
They might mock you a little bit in

36
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:53,920
their reply.
They understand what they're optimized

37
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:54,730
to be great at.

38
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,640
They understand what they have to give
up in order to deliver on that.

39
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,820
And they understand it from the top of
the organization all the way down to the

40
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:04,300
bottom.
One of the things that southwest does in

41
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,090
a training experience is,
um,

42
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,730
they get everyone,
all the new recruits in a room,

43
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,770
and they have everyone stand up and
share their most embarrassing moment.

44
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,390
So people in the moment think this is
pretty hardcore.

45
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:19,780
I mean,
they're,

46
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,740
they're testing us for poise and our
ability to communicate in a stressful

47
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:28,090
situation.
And it turns out southwest isn't looking

48
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:30,820
at the speaker.
They're looking at everyone else and

49
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:35,821
they're looking for signs of empathy.
And so when they see signs of empathy in

50
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:38,020
that crowd,
those are the people that they ended up

51
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:39,430
hiring.
So it's,

52
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,270
you know,
it's a great example of a distinct

53
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:46,630
clarity on the values that are important
to them and figuring out how to find

54
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:47,464
them,
uh,

55
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,230
in the hiring.
Yeah.

56
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,530
Process excellence is designed times
culture.

57
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,950
You have to get the design right and you
have to get the culture right.

58
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,590
Great design.
Bad Culture won't work.

59
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,050
Great culture,
bad design won't work.

60
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,290
We need both.
In southwest is just a magnificent

61
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,610
illustration of both.

62
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:07,570
Okay.
