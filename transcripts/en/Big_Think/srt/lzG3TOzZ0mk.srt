1
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,150
And I don't really worry about to listen
to what they think,

2
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,340
but it seems to make a living.

3
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,350
Transcendental meditation is one
particular

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,990
form of mantra meditation,
and there are many that allows your mind

5
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:35,991
to experience progressively abstract
fields of awareness and ultimately just

6
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,820
settled out in the space between your
thoughts.

7
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,230
The space between your thoughts is pure
consciousness.

8
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,580
And uh,
it's a field of possibilities is a field

9
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:53,370
of creativity.
It's a field of correlation.

10
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,940
It's also feel the one certainty and
it's also a field where intention

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,360
actualizes it's own fulfillment.
So that meditation allows you to contact

12
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:11,130
this field which is very primordial the
ground state of our existence

13
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,340
according to our current understanding
of it,

14
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:17,340
king

15
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,390
of the universe.
The physical universe is actually made

16
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:26,220
up of energy and information.
Wherever there are objects,

17
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,970
there are fields of energy and also have
inflammation.

18
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,250
And if you go to the very fundamental
levels of activity in nature,

19
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,820
you find that nature is a discontinuity.
Which means even though our perceptual

20
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:45,300
experience of the universe is that it's
continuous,

21
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,720
in fact,
it's going on and off at the speed of

22
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:51,300
light.
We know what's in the honor of the

23
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:53,760
universe.
It's energy and information and we use

24
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:57,290
it in our technology when we use cell
phones yourself,

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,370
the information highway on the internet
or cell or send each other email,

26
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,780
but the deeper question is what in the
half,

27
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,810
what's between the two aunts in the
discontinuity and many people in quantum

28
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:18,171
physics in the world of quantum physics
or realizing or thinking or

29
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,870
hypothesizing that the discontinuity is
consciousness itself.

30
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,600
That consciousness is not a byproduct of
evolution as has been suggested or for

31
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:37,170
that matter.
An expression of our brains or the itch

32
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:42,171
expresses itself through our brains.
That consciousness is the common ground

33
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:47,430
of existence that ultimately
differentiate into space,

34
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:48,330
time,
energy,

35
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:51,810
information and matter,
and the same consciousness is

36
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:56,130
responsible for our thoughts,
for our emotions and feelings,

37
00:02:56,131 --> 00:03:00,400
for our behaviors,
for our personal relationships,

38
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:04,930
for a social interactions,
for the environments that we find

39
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:08,530
ourselves in and for our biology.
In other words,

40
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,730
consciousness is the ground of being the
differentiates into everything that we

41
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:16,900
call reality,
including the observer and the objects

42
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:21,610
of observation.
And this is a much deeper understanding

43
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:26,611
of consciousness that is coming about as
a result of some insights from the world

44
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:33,511
of quantum physics.
Not everyone agrees on this theory.

45
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,290
In fact,
a number of scientists are still tied to

46
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:42,100
the old paradigm,
which is that matter is the essential

47
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:45,430
reality and that consciousness is the
epi phenomenon.

48
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,960
But it turns out that,
um,

49
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,040
even to explain simple things,
how do you perceive color?

50
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,160
How do you imagine?
How do you see pictures in

51
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:56,620
consciousness?
The sounds in consciousness?

52
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,370
You have to recognize that this can not
be explained by any reductionist model.

53
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,050
When you experience a sound or a color
or a taste or a smell,

54
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,830
the activity in your brain is just a
quarter of charges that goes on and off.

55
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,950
How does that code of charges going on
and off become physical reality?

56
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,880
And where does that happen?
Uh,

57
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,320
if we understand this model of quantum
physics,

58
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,430
then it becomes apparent that,
uh,

59
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,460
we're not in the physical world.
The physical world is in us.

60
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,940
We create the physical world and the
when we perceive it,

61
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,120
when we observe it,
and also we create it's experienced in

62
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:48,121
our imagination and when I say we,
I don't mean the physical body or the

63
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:51,610
brain,
but that deeper domain of consciousness

64
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,800
which conceives governance constructs
and actually becomes everything that we

65
00:04:56,801 --> 00:05:00,820
call physical reality.
This is a model that is being explored

66
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:05,140
by some cutting edge scientists both in
the field of neuroscience and also in

67
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:09,700
the field of quantum physics,
but it is also a model that was explored

68
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:14,410
by the great sages and seers,
some of whom were the authors of the

69
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,243
Bhagavad Gita itself.

70
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,660
My medical training was in the field of
internal medicine and then in the field

71
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:27,010
of endocrinology and neuroendocrinology
neuroendocrinology.

72
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:32,011
The study of brain chemicals and brain
chemicals are the mechanics through

73
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:37,630
which our thoughts express ourselves.
So when you have a thought or feeling or

74
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:41,950
an emotion or an idea,
you make have a specific chemical.

75
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:46,570
It's called neuropeptide,
and these neuropeptides are messenger

76
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:51,010
molecules that then go to the rest of
the body and influence the activity of

77
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:55,240
the immune system.
And actually almost every biological

78
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:58,370
activity in the body,
so your body,

79
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,540
which is very physical,
is under the influence of your thoughts,

80
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,010
your feelings,
your emotions,

81
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:05,600
your dreams,
your fantasies,

82
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,850
your desires,
your instincts,

83
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:10,070
your drives,
your imagination.

84
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,460
All these things orchestrate themselves.
All these internal activities that occur

85
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,250
in the invisible domain that we call
consciousness actually have very precise

86
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,380
physical effects both in our biology,
but they also influence our perception

87
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:27,464
of the world.

88
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,470
Um,
over the years I've looked at the

89
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,390
biological markers of aging,
and these include things like blood

90
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:40,800
pressure,
bone density,

91
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,380
body temperature regulation,
um,

92
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,200
skin thickness,
the number of wrinkles,

93
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,680
immune function,
sex hormone levels.

94
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,120
I'm hearing vision.
There are a number of ways you can

95
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:58,980
measure what we call biological aging.
Then there's something called

96
00:06:58,981 --> 00:07:03,030
chronological aging,
which is a direct reflection of when you

97
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:04,860
were born,
the date you were born,

98
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,870
and then there's psychological age,
which is how a young you feel

99
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,820
psychologically.
And there is more and more data that the

100
00:07:14,821 --> 00:07:19,800
biological markers of aging are more
under the influence of psychological

101
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:24,750
factors.
Then the chronological age that we

102
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:26,940
usually associate with.
Of course,

103
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:29,730
there are other things that influence
our aging process,

104
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,180
including how we perceive time.
If you're constantly running out of

105
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:38,250
time,
then your biological clock speeds up

106
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,720
when you do run out of time with a heart
attack or something like that.

107
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,820
Um,
the quality of our self esteem

108
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,620
determined,
so we age our perception of our bodies,

109
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,670
uh,
as fields of energy or as fields of

110
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,970
matter influence how our body ages,
and there are many other things,

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
the quality of our rest as in sleep or
the quality of our ability to manage

112
00:08:07,981 --> 00:08:12,660
stress as through meditation,
physical exercise,

113
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,790
mind,
body coordination,

114
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:19,500
through techniques such as yoga and
breathing and martial arts.

115
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,470
Um,
the quality of our relationships,

116
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,670
whether we have toxic relationships or
healing relationships,

117
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:32,210
the quality of our emotions,
toxic emotions or emotions that,

118
00:08:32,281 --> 00:08:33,480
uh,
uh,

119
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,840
foster connectivity,
these all influence how we age aging is

120
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:44,910
subject to revision.
So you're going to have somebody who's

121
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,900
chronologically 80 but could be
biologically 65.

122
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,390
On the other hand,
you can have somebody who's

123
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,560
chronologically 25 and they're
physically and mentally burned out of

124
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,620
their biological age.
Maybe much older are the fastest growing

125
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:05,901
segment of the population in the world
right now is over the age of 90 and in

126
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:09,150
some cases or the age of 100 and some
countries,

127
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,780
so people are living longer and even
though much of it as attribute it to

128
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,310
modern medicine,
it's not.

129
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,960
It's lifestyle,
it's nutrition is the quality of

130
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:25,650
exercise,
the ability to manage stress and some of

131
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:26,600
the factors that have made

132
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,763
sure.

133
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,010
I think everybody has a role in their
own aging.

134
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,000
Some people accelerated,
some people a slow it down,

135
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:43,270
some people manage to reverse it.
It all depends on how much you are

136
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:48,890
invested in the hypnosis of social
conditioning,

137
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,450
so if you believe that it's certain age,
you have to retire and become

138
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:58,451
dysfunctional than you will.
What I do is mostly creativity.

139
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,470
I think a creativities and the static
impulse that we all have and there's

140
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,960
nothing more joyful than having a moment
of creative insight and then actually

141
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,430
creating a or rather manifesting or
incarnating your creative insight into

142
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:28,630
actual physical reality.
The struggle is part of the creative

143
00:10:31,151 --> 00:10:35,850
process and it's very enjoyable to have
to struggle without the struggle.

144
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:41,450
There will be no joy and creativity.
The one thing that is not enjoyable is

145
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:46,581
that if you get attached to the outcome
and if you're constantly looking for

146
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:53,370
approval and you are not immune to
criticism,

147
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,710
then you are in trouble and you'll
continue to be struggling and never find

148
00:10:58,711 --> 00:10:59,544
the creativity

149
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,390
run through.
All my work are that consciousness is

150
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:13,500
the ultimate reality,
and that by understanding consciousness,

151
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:15,810
you understand everything about
yourself,

152
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,720
about perception,
about creativity,

153
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:21,300
about behavior,
about relationships.

154
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:26,870
So by understanding God's justice,
you have the ability to create anything

155
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:31,890
in your world and you have the ability
to influence also the collective

156
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,160
consciousness to not only bring about
personal healing,

157
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:39,930
but social transformation and ultimately
healing our planet,

158
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,820
which happens to me extremely wounded.
So in the upanishads,

159
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,670
in which includes the Bhagavad Gita,
they say no,

160
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:50,280
that one thing,
by knowing which everything else is not,

161
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,290
and that one thing is fine.
