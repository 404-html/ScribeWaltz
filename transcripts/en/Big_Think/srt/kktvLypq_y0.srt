1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,613
Hmm.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,260
I don't think the day is coming.
Soon when we'll look back at that,

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,470
people who believe in God,
we're,

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,360
you know,
that was a silly age.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,040
Uh,
although some of us look like,

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,450
look,
look at it that way now.

7
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:18,360
But um,
but clearly the numbers are,

8
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:19,590
you know,
we're not in the majority yet,

9
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:21,330
but the fastest growing group,
uh,

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,000
best growing religious group,
so called is the nuns.

11
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,490
The Ano.
And people check the box for no

12
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:29,580
religious affiliation.
Now they're not necessarily atheists or

13
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:30,900
agnostics,
skeptics,

14
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:33,930
but they are not affiliated with a
religion.

15
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,160
And so on one level,
I don't care what somebody believes as

16
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:41,370
long as they leave me alone and they
don't interfere with my rights,

17
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:44,130
they don't try to kill me and bother me.
Um,

18
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:44,881
I mean,
you know,

19
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:47,820
the JW is the Jehovah witnesses.
They come to my door once in a while.

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,320
The Mormons come to my door once in a
while,

21
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,810
it kind of amusing.
I invite them in and give him a copy of

22
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:54,450
skeptic magazine and they're like,
oh,

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,740
we better call the the head guy.
Come down here.

24
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,390
That's relatively harmless.
But,

25
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,280
but clearly we see with Islam and,
and that problem of Islamic terrorism,

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,100
you know,
religion has to be reformed.

27
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,080
It absolutely does.
I don't worry about the Janes or,

28
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,650
or,
or Jews or most Christians,

29
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,320
uh,
causing societal problems anymore

30
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:17,900
because they've gone through the
reformation.

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,260
Enlightenment,
the age of reason,

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,540
the scientific revolution that came out
the other side,

33
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,280
mostly nonviolent.
And,

34
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:23,820
uh,
you know,

35
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,100
Islam hasn't,
uh,

36
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,300
I think it would be a reform Islam and
then start to wean people off belief in

37
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:34,050
the supernatural altogether.
You can't do it by Fiat,

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,590
but we can inculcate into people's
thinking,

39
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,700
critical thinking about everything,
including God,

40
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,140
throw God into the mix.

41
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,800
That's just another supernatural belief.
And that's what those of us who work in

42
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:48,990
this area are trying to do.
Uh,

43
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:50,130
you know,
the different strategies,

44
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:54,030
you can be aggressive about it.
Like Richard Dawkins and hitch,

45
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:54,480
you know,
they're,

46
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,350
they're pretty anti anti theist that
works in some cases,

47
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,540
but not other cases,
other areas.

48
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:03,720
People need to be reeled in slowly,
gently,

49
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:04,771
you know,
and,

50
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:05,604
uh,
it's,

51
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,690
that's just a sort of a marketing,
sales and marketing problem.

52
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,520
You know how,
how,

53
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,840
how should we sell our product best?
We call it this.

54
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,220
We use the red logo or the blue logo,
that sort of product,

55
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:21,390
test those things and see what works.
But we all share this overall goal in a

56
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,640
century or two.
I think it's possible.

57
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,340
No one will believe in God anymore,
almost no one.

58
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,760
Uh,
and that will be good for society.
