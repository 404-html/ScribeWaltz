1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,840
Some way.
My book is an optimistic book because I

2
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,990
argue about all of our,
uh,

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,730
our limitations and how empathy leads us
astray.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,590
But in order to make that argument,
we also have to have an appreciation

5
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:21,210
that we're smart enough to realize that
empathy could lead us astray and that

6
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:23,430
we're smart enough to ask those to
override.

7
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:27,810
It's pernicious effects.
So it's empathy that causes me to favor,

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,350
uh,
somebody who looks like me over somebody

9
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:36,351
who does a tour or a somebody from my
country or ethnicity over a stranger.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,540
But it's rationality that leads me to
say,

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,550
hey,
that's not reasonable.

12
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,680
There is no reason to do it.
It's not fair.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,680
It's not impartial.
And so we should try to override

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,800
empathy.
And my outlook is very optimistic.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,200
I'm a huge fan of reason and rationality
that we can work together and deliberate

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,560
and talk and argue and through this come
with some great accomplishments.

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,460
So what I argue is that we have the
capacity for rationality and reason.

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,900
This is actually fairly controversial in
my field.

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,910
Uh,
my fellow psychologists,

20
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:16,320
philosophers and neuroscientists often
argue that we're a prisoners of the

21
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:18,930
emotions that were fundamentally and
profoundly irrational.

22
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,490
And that reason plays very little role
in our everyday lives,

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,260
which is to say,
well,

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,300
determinism of a sword,
it's true.

25
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,950
Um,
what we,

26
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:30,300
what we do,
how we act,

27
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:35,301
how we think is a product of events that
have started a very long time ago plus

28
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:39,120
physical law.
We are just kind of pr.

29
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,710
We are physical creatures.
We are not,

30
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:43,650
we can't escape from causality.
So we'll just continue doing what we're

31
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:46,080
doing.
One of the main goals of my work is to

32
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:48,600
argue against that.
I think that notion is a more

33
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:50,880
responsibility can we reconcile with
determinism?

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,240
But I think determinism is correct,
but none of that challenges rationality.

35
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,660
And as an illustration,
you could imagine a computer that's

36
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:04,830
entirely determined,
but there's also entirely rational.

37
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,420
You could imagine on another computer is
entirely determined but as capricious

38
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:14,421
and arbitrary and random.
And so even in a deterministic universe

39
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,820
to question remains,
what sort of computer are we?

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,760
Are we are emotional creatures,
are we rational creatures?

41
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,470
But there is nothing,
not the slightest bit of inconsistency

42
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,950
between the claim that we live in a
determine universe and that we're

43
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:32,040
rational reasoning creatures.
I think it's worked with science.

44
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,250
Science is the paradigmatic case where
the exercise of reason by ESD is

45
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:40,620
imperfect.
People has come up with extraordinary

46
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:43,710
discoveries about the origin of the
universe to origin of life,

47
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,160
the atomic structure of material
objects,

48
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,940
amazing things.
And I think we could do the same thing

49
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:54,090
with mortality.
I think people can argue and deliberate

50
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,040
about morality.
Now,

51
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,920
whenever I say this and whenever I talk
about about empathy,

52
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,790
I always get a cynical response.

53
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,000
And the cynical response is I think
reasonable enough,

54
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,050
which is to say,
well,

55
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,400
that's not how it works in the real
world.

56
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,060
I was reminded recently that we're
supposed to live in a post fact world

57
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:11,160
right now.
Um,

58
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,120
the real,
in the real world,

59
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,030
people are persuaded by whoever yells
the loudest,

60
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:20,740
whoever appeals to their self interests,
whoever tweaks their emotions,

61
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:25,180
including empathy.
And I honestly don't doubt that that's

62
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,020
right.
In a short term.

63
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,340
I think that in any case,
if I want it to persuade somebody to go

64
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:34,420
to war against Syria,
to give money to this cause,

65
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,600
to expel that group from my country,
I would appeal to their emotions and

66
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,510
anybody who appeals to their emotions
would be much more successful in those

67
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,120
who attempt to make a rational
deliberate of argument.

68
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,960
But I think in a long run over time,
reason and rationality tends to win out.

69
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,220
I look at the world we're in now and for
all of its many flaws and problems,

70
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,750
I see signs of those moral
accomplishments all over the place where

71
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:05,290
I think we care more for people.
We had forgotten about that.

72
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,740
We have a broader moral circle as Peter
Singer would say.

73
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,690
We are less prone to kill each other as
Steve Pinker has demonstrated in his

74
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:16,810
work.
And there's a lot of explanation for

75
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:20,000
these changes.
But I think one key component has been

76
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,500
exercise of reason and I'm optimistic
we'll continue to see in the future.
