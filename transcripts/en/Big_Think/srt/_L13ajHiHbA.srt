1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:10,410
I think the question of acceptance of
lgbt folks really does depend on

2
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:14,780
geography in some places on earth.
Um,

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,280
I would say when it comes to legal
equality and cultural acceptance,

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,340
absolutely there's been this revolution
and progress has occurred at a pace that

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,810
even in our own lifetimes,
um,

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,780
was almost inconceivable in terms of how
quickly things have evolved.

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,750
At the same time,
just today,

8
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,710
two point 8 billion people living in
countries around the globe,

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,560
we're being gay as a crime.
Um,

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,760
and in some places like India,
progress toward equality has actually

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,350
been reversed.
So in back in 2013,

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,080
India Supreme Court re criminalized
sodomy and,

13
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:56,080
and same sex activity which had become
legal.

14
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:01,290
So there are examples of countries where
progress has actually been reversed when

15
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:07,480
we talk about how have things changed in
terms of equality or the movement toward

16
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:12,481
equality for Lgbt q folks?
I think the biggest and most dramatic

17
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:17,881
example is marriage equality,
which somewhat miraculously I think and

18
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:23,890
not inevitably did become the law of the
land.

19
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,770
And all 50 states,
thanks to the Supreme Court in the

20
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:31,771
obergefell decision decision are now
required to recognize same sex marriage,

21
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:39,150
but I think it's important to remember
that marriage equality does not mean or

22
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:44,110
is not synonymous with full equality in
terms of constitutional protections.

23
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,240
And in fact,
it,

24
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,020
it,
it,

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,020
it is in fact true that a couple could
get married on a Sunday and then one of

26
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:56,350
the partners goes to work on Monday,
puts a picture of his husband or her

27
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:59,400
wife on,
on the desk and gets fired because in

28
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:03,880
the majority of us states,
it is still completely legal for people

29
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:06,730
to be fired on the basis of sexual
orientation.

30
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:12,180
And the Civil Rights Act of 1964 doesn't
cover sexual orientation or gender

31
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:14,170
identity.
There's a movement,

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,780
uh,
among activists and,

33
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:20,781
and gay rights organizations to expand
the scope of the 1964 civil rights act

34
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,250
to go beyond race and gender and color
and national origin,

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,010
which are covered a categories.

36
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,470
But at this point,
sexual orientation is,

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,810
is not covered by the 1964,
uh,

38
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,730
legislation.
I guess the context,

39
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,240
it wasn't until 1973 that the American
psychiatric association came to the

40
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:50,911
conclusion that homosexuality in general
is not a mental illness,

41
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:56,011
and that was the year when the APA voted
to take homosexuality out of its

42
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:58,450
diagnostic manual.
Until that point,

43
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,270
every gay person,
no matter how well adjusted or healthy

44
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:04,210
or functioning was,
um,

45
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,170
considered mentally ill.
So that's the background.

46
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:13,171
And really that wasn't so long ago that
our most progressive doctors were,

47
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,420
were under the assumption or we're,
we're working on this theory that

48
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:21,760
homosexuality was in fact a mental
disease.

49
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,320
So I think conversion therapy is the
kind of the contemporary cousin to that,

50
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:31,180
to that belief that gay people are sick
and that they can be cured or that they

51
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:32,560
need to be cured.
Um,

52
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,700
and certainly,
you know,

53
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,610
dozens of medical,
uh,

54
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,710
established organizations ranging from
the Ama to youth organizations have

55
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:43,270
condemned conversion therapy.

56
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,270
But this idea that people who are gay
can be converted into not being gay is

57
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:55,651
indeed still alive.
And my sense is that at this point seven

58
00:03:56,351 --> 00:04:00,310
states have outlawed conversion therapy
among miners.

59
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,880
Meaning that in the other 43 states,
it's still allowed for parents to send

60
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:08,890
their children,
their minor children.

61
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,750
I'm into this kind of therapy,
um,

62
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,930
and to,
to um,

63
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:19,050
acquire that kids under 18 go through
this process.

64
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,830
Um,
there haven't been studies of people

65
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,530
who've undergone the therapy and,
and you know,

66
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,100
consistently there's this sense of,
of a finding that the therapy not only

67
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:38,011
doesn't change people from being gay to
straight but inflicts its own harm and

68
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,420
trauma.
And there is federal legislation being

69
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:45,550
considered where there would be a
national ban.

70
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,920
Um,
which again,

71
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:52,921
I think is common sense and I hope that
as we see a new generation of young

72
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,800
people becoming more open and more
accepting,

73
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,140
um,
and,

74
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:05,740
and the sense of allies among teenagers
and young people,

75
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,920
I think that's the key to ultimately a
ending conversion therapy.
