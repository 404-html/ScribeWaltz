1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,380
One of the things that has begun to
worry me is the fact that I'm seeing

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,410
change happening at a scale which was
unimaginable before and that is

3
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:11,880
impacting the industry after industry
after industry.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,320
Every industry I've looked at,
I've seen a trend of major disruption

5
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:19,340
happening.
Manufacturing is the most obvious does

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,230
with robotics and three d printing as of
this year.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,830
It is cheaper to manufacture in the
United States than it is in China.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,190
It is cheaper to manufacture in Europe
than it is in China.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,310
Why is that?
Because of the automated robots that

10
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:36,910
have two arms that have screens which
show you the emotion with the sensors

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,870
they have around them.
I'm talking about Baxter from rethink

12
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:43,050
robotics or universal.
These robots have become very

13
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:46,620
sophisticated.
The cost of operation is less than the

14
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:50,370
cost of human labor,
so we can now have robots working 24

15
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:53,760
slash seven through the things that
human beings did give it five years.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,740
These robots will become ever more
sophisticated.

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,780
They'll be doing many,
many more jobs,

18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,020
which means that the manufacturing
industry is going to be disrupted in a

19
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:04,410
very big way.
The good news for America is that it's

20
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:07,050
coming back here.
The good news for Europe is coming back

21
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:10,350
there.
The good news for Asia is that it's also

22
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:13,620
going to become a local industry,
bad news with China because it's no

23
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:15,570
longer no longer going to happen in
China,

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,540
so by the end of the decade,
you're going to see major upheaval in

25
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:22,890
manufacturing opportunities and problems
move into the next decade.

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,500
These men,
these robots will probably go on strike

27
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:29,310
because we won't need them anymore.
We'll have three d printers now within

28
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:31,650
15 to 20 years,
we will be able to three d print

29
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,680
electronics.
So imagine being able to design your own

30
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:38,730
iphone and printed at home.
That is what becomes technically

31
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,610
feasible in the in the 15 to 20 year
timeframe.

32
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,660
So you're talking about major disruption
happening to manufacturing the short

33
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:48,510
term and then even greater disruption
happening in the longterm.

34
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,660
Now look at finance.
We're seeing the turmoil that bitcoin is

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,460
crew guys grading.
You now have many parties supporting it.

36
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,210
Well,
you also have crowdfunding shaking up

37
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,060
the,
uh,

38
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,080
the venture capital industry that they
become less relevant.

39
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,490
We'll soon have a crowdfunding for loans
that,

40
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:10,350
uh,
in some countries already experimenting

41
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:11,460
with,
with,

42
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:14,550
um,
taking out loans by we want to buy a

43
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,540
house.
You want to buy a car,

44
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,520
you simply get it from a large number of
people.

45
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,230
You're now moving into a cardless
transactions for purchasing goods.

46
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,260
We may not need the banks anymore.
We may not need financial institutions

47
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:26,680
the way we do right now,
so,

48
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,400
so there's gonna be disrupting happy to
financial services,

49
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,060
whether or not financial services we
realized is that in the USA they seem to

50
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:35,430
be complacent because they've got laws
protecting them,

51
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,770
but the same laws don't apply in other
countries.

52
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,290
We may well have major innovations
happening abroad,

53
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,600
which companies now used to the United
States.

54
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,110
Look at healthcare that already we now
have apple putting a stake in the ground

55
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,190
saying,
we're going to be the platform for

56
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:52,630
health.
They basically have to have announced

57
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:56,250
their health platform.
What they want is that all of these new

58
00:02:56,251 --> 00:03:00,610
sensor devices that are becoming common,
which monitor your blood pressure,

59
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:04,480
which monitor your blood oxygenation.
We Monitor your heartbeats which monitor

60
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:08,890
your temperature with mighty activity
levels and soon which will monitor your

61
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,820
blood glucose and monitor your
internals.

62
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,450
They want all of these data being
uploaded to the apple platform.

63
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,460
Do you think google,
Google will be left behind?

64
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,080
Do you think Microsoft will be left
behind?

65
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,420
Do you think Samsung will be left
behind?

66
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,410
Everyone is jumping into the act,
but soon when you have all of these

67
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:27,940
data,
we were able to.

68
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,580
We will be able to transform the
healthcare industry because we will be

69
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:32,950
able to predict when someone is about to
get sick,

70
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,940
we will have ai based physicians.
They can advise us when we're about to

71
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:39,280
get sick,
that can advise us on what we need to do

72
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:42,220
to get healthy.
When he said the problem that doctors

73
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:47,200
have right now is that the data that we
get back from medical tests is so

74
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,750
complicated that they can't.
They can often not understand it,

75
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,500
especially in fields like cancer.
If you look at the reports,

76
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,990
and I've seen some of these reports is
incredibly complex,

77
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,120
add to it,
the genome genomics area,

78
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:01,690
we're going to be getting the cost of
human genome sequencing has dropped to a

79
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,523
thousand dollars over the last,
uh,

80
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,730
15 years at the rate at which we're
going.

81
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,370
The cost of sequencing will be
practically zero.

82
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,070
So the,
which means they will all have genomes

83
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:12,904
done.

84
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,090
You combine that with the medical sensor
data combined with the data we have in

85
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:18,330
the cloud.
You've got a healthcare revolution

86
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,160
revolution.
We won't need doctors for day to day

87
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:24,670
medical advice anymore would have
robotic surgeons doing sophisticated

88
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:27,280
surgery.
So we're going to impact the medical

89
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:29,980
professionals.
We're going to now append the entire

90
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,860
healthcare system.
There will be no it all in the next five

91
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:35,440
to 10 years.
People don't seem to understand this.

92
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,510
Now.
Look at the energy industry.

93
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,930
We're fighting wars over oil.
We,

94
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,900
five years ago we worried about America
running out of oil.

95
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,990
Today we're talking about Saudi America
because of fracking.

96
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,660
Fracking is a harmful technology.
Nevertheless,

97
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,220
it is allowed America to become energy
independent and soon to become an energy

98
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:56,110
exporter.
Forget about fracking.

99
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,050
Solar itself is something we've become
negative about,

100
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,630
but solar has dropped about 97 point two
percent over the past 35 years in price

101
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,260
at the rate at which solar is advancing
by the end of this decade,

102
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:10,240
which is grid parody in the United
States.

103
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,680
Great Parliament is cheaper to produce
energy at home on your soda cells than

104
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,290
buying from the grid.
Move forward another 10 years.

105
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,470
It costs you $100 much to,
to,

106
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:21,910
uh,
produce your own solar,

107
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,590
your own energy.
Then to buy from the grid,

108
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,150
which means that we have these great
companies now in serious trouble.

109
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,120
This is why you have the utilities
fighting solar,

110
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,060
that they're now started opposing solar
subsidies.

111
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,420
They're now doing everything they can to
stop the solar industry because on its

112
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,990
own solar,
if it keeps advancing the way it will

113
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:41,440
end and there's every indication that it
will,

114
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,470
it's going to eclipse the fossil fuel
industry.

115
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,730
And solar is one of maybe 100
technologies that are advancing which

116
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:53,720
will change the energy industry.
So now you have unlimited energy was

117
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,320
guess what?
We have unlimited clean water because we

118
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:59,270
can simply bond much water as we wanted
them to have unlimited water.

119
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,200
We can now have vertical farms in which
we grow food locally.

120
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,000
Imagine now having 100 percent organic
food where you don't have to have have

121
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,760
insecticides and so on,
pumped into it because you haven't

122
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,520
produced in sealed buildings in,
in,

123
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:16,970
in vertical farms.
Imagine not being able to three d print

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,690
meat so we don't have to start animals.
So we're talking about upending

125
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:25,691
agriculture and the food production
industry so I can go on and on and on.

126
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:28,880
Every industry I've looked at,
I've seen major disruption.

127
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,380
Even even a good old communications,
they look at the impact 80 and t,

128
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:36,620
verizon and sprint will suffer over the
next decade or so.

129
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,840
They've seen the landline business
disappear,

130
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,160
landlines went to a mobile and then now
we have data.

131
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,370
I mean when I travel abroad right now to
make long distance calls anymore because

132
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,850
I just call her a skype.
Imagine when we have wifi everywhere.

133
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Att and t and Google are competing now
to do wire up a regions with super fast

134
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:59,720
Internet access.
What happens now when you have open

135
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,280
networks everywhere,
so so you can make phone calls over wifi

136
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:06,080
networks.
We're talking about disrupting the

137
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:09,080
communications industry.
I can go on and on and on,

138
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:12,350
but every industry I look at,
I see major disruption happening,

139
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,280
so the world 10 to 15 to 20 years from
now is going to be completely different.

140
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:18,560
We're going to be disrupting industry
after industry after industry.

141
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:23,540
The vast majority of companies who are
the leaders right now may not even exist

142
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:27,620
because the problem is that not only are
people not aware of it,

143
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,900
most industry executives,
they're not invested our money that will

144
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:33,380
be required for them to reinvent
themselves.

145
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,360
They dare not put themselves out of
business.

146
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:38,350
So,
so a major disruption as company is

147
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,720
coming.
Our industry heads are worried about

148
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:45,680
short term performance.
They did not see that this future we're

149
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,660
headed into so they're going to be
disrupted.

150
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:50,660
We will have new industries coming out
of nowhere eclipsing these,

151
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,790
this old line industries,
nutrilon,

152
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,250
dollar industries,
wiping out existing trillion dollar

153
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:57,140
industries.
This is the future we're headed into.

154
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,610
For better or for worse.
