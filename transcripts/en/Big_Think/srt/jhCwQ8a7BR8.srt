1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,080
You know what,
some of my best friends are funny

2
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,010
ladies.
I mean,

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,873
what,
you know,

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,560
I don't,
I don't understand.

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,760
Maybe they are using maybe when they
talk about women not being funny,

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,760
maybe in kind of not in the way they
were,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,440
you know,
young male,

8
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:30,620
humorous used.
Maybe it's more in a more intelligent

9
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:33,920
way that women use comedy.
There's all kinds of comedy.

10
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:38,921
There's will ferrell movies and there's
a Larry David on curby enthusiasm one I

11
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:41,600
enjoy totally in one.
I just don't.

12
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,810
So I think it's the way you use it.
There was an article written in Vanity

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,710
Fair.
I was at Vanity Fair and one of the

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,690
women aren't funny.
Well,

15
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:53,390
I think he was talking about the way
women use humor.

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,890
Men Use humor to get something out of
the relationship where women don't use

17
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,990
it that way.
I think that's the difference in every

18
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:03,650
time I hear about women not being funny.
I think women are terrific.

19
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:06,260
I think they're equal.
I think everybody's equal in it.

20
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,290
Um,
there are less women comedians around

21
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:12,290
than there men.
I'd say it's about 20 percent women

22
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,370
comedians compared to men.

23
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,620
I don't know,
maybe I,

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,880
I don't know,
maybe because of the work that goes into

25
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:26,670
it,
it's a very company is very aggressive.

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,200
I mean,
it's hard.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,900
You're out every night trying to write
material,

28
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:32,370
perform material.
So it,

29
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:34,380
it's,
it's grueling and you have to have that

30
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,350
kind of drive inside of you to do it.
I mean,

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,550
to make it,
a lot of these,

32
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,000
these comedians,
comedians are on the road all the time

33
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,830
and it's,
it's not the easiest life and it's not

34
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:46,470
these life hanging around a clubs every
night also.

35
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:50,310
So you really want it and be able to,
uh,

36
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,170
to get onstage,
you know,

37
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,880
for at least 10 years and doing that
stuff.

38
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:58,881
That's a long time.
I like Miss London,

39
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,620
La.
I like Susie Essman.

40
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:04,480
I like Lynn couplets.
I liked my friend,

41
00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:06,700
joy behar,
judy gold.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,680
I don't want to leave anybody out of
this.

43
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:10,110
Um,
um,

44
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,370
there were a number of,
of,

45
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,510
of,
of young women around coming up the

46
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:15,670
ranks,
Jessica Kirson.

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
So there's a lot of ladies working in
New York.
