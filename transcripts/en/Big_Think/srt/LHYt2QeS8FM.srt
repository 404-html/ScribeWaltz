1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,960
There are myths of creativity and these
myths are usually propagated by people

2
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:17,321
that have romantic notions about heroes,
romantic notions about Eureka moments.

3
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,060
And these myths of creativity keep
people from collaborating and it causes

4
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:27,650
them to be a lone wolf and the research
says it causes them to fail.

5
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:30,230
So let me talk a little bit about those
myths of creativity.

6
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,130
In the world of sales and marketing,
I battle against three myths.

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,190
Myth number one,
the lone inventor.

8
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:43,430
This is very dangerous because there is
no such thing as alone in venture.

9
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:46,160
As a matter of fact,
there's a lot of historical research

10
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:48,530
that has debunked.
Einstein,

11
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,260
uh,
specifically in terms of inventions.

12
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:53,870
Henry Ford,
not a lone inventor.

13
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,700
Um,
classic example,

14
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:57,770
Thomas Edison in the invention
community.

15
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,950
Thomas Edison is a brand.
It stands for 14 people.

16
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,380
Yes,
there was a figure head named Thomas

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,150
Edison.
His name's on 10,000 patents.

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,860
He did not invent a single thing.
He marshaled people together and knew

19
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,560
how to spot innovations and put people
together.

20
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:14,720
Lack of a creative soup,
if you will.

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,540
Here's a classic example.
A Steve Jobs.

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,130
You know,
you ask the average person,

23
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:21,680
say a millennial who uses a lot of apple
technology,

24
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,510
who's one of the greatest inventors of
our time?

25
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:24,590
They'll say,
Steve Jobs.

26
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,130
Steve jobs once said,
I never created anything.

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,600
All I did was notice patterns.
It put people together to finish

28
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:34,070
projects,
so think about it.

29
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,370
If he doesn't have Wazniak,
there is no original apple,

30
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:39,390
right?
If he doesn't have eyes,

31
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,410
there is no ipod.
If he doesn't have Tony Fidel,

32
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,740
there is no iphone and the list goes on
and on.

33
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,400
Got a good friend of mine,
David Berkus.

34
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,350
He wrote a really wonderful book,
the about about the myths of,

35
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:56,351
of genius and he was telling me that
it's a romantic notion and I remember

36
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,020
when I first read this research years
ago,

37
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:02,810
no lone inventor,
it did kind of hurt my feelings.

38
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,110
I'm the musician.
In my past I thought I wrote a lot of

39
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:07,970
songs,
but according to the research,

40
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:11,270
I didn't never wrote a song.
I always collaborated with somebody.

41
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,390
The song that actually made it to the
record and made it on the radio,

42
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,660
had 15 to 50 hands on it.
When I talked to David,

43
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:19,700
I said,
when I read your research kind of hurt

44
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:20,481
my feelings.
He goes,

45
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:23,150
it's a romantic notion because we want
to be heroes.

46
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,820
We want to be as empowered as I then
ran.

47
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:27,770
We want to think that we're the
fountainhead.

48
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,510
So this is how we tell the story.
But until you believe that genius is a

49
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:36,170
team sport,
you will never give up control.

50
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,370
And this is the problem for a lot of
people in sales.

51
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,020
Um,
they don't want to seed any level of

52
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:47,021
control over their process to somebody
outside of sales world because they

53
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:49,970
don't value those voices enough.

54
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,530
But the research is clear on this.
Miller Heiman Institute research the

55
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:57,800
difference between good and great.
They call it world class organizations.

56
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,610
They,
when they 20% more than their nearest

57
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:03,100
competitor,
the only thing they have in common is

58
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:07,000
they've broken this myth and they
understand that every deal is about

59
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:10,900
rapid problem solving and no one person
can solve the problem on their own

60
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,750
quickly.
The other two myths of creativity that

61
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:18,751
must be dispelled is the Eureka moment.
There is no such thing as a big idea

62
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:21,460
that changes the world.
I know this is another one of those

63
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:24,610
hurtful but very true based on empirical
research points.

64
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,070
There are little ideas that combine with
other little ideas that improve

65
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:34,420
themselves into game changing ideas.
And I've experienced this personally,

66
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:38,080
but who I consider a one of the
authorities on creativity.

67
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,100
Um,
ed catmull,

68
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,730
president of Pixar,
I remember standing backstage a few

69
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,250
years ago just gushing to him about John
Lasseter.

70
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,330
I'm like,
John Lasseter,

71
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:48,190
his vp of creative.
I'm like,

72
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:50,590
he's the bomb.
This is the guy who wrote wally the

73
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:52,510
commercial.
This is the guy that wrote the script

74
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:53,500
for toy story.
You know,

75
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:58,030
telling the story from the toys point of
view and that remember catmull looked at

76
00:03:58,031 --> 00:03:58,990
me,
cut me off,

77
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:03,991
and not to dismiss lassiner he said toy
story was a problematic idea from the

78
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:09,310
start.
Make an entire full length feature film

79
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:12,310
inside a computer.
Do you understand how hard that is from

80
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:15,760
a rendering time standpoint?
Make the characters as human as human.

81
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,110
They didn't even have facial controller
technology at the time for this and tell

82
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:24,610
the story from the toys point of view,
when we've never historically had a toy,

83
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,270
I have any narrative for us to draw on.
Gaton will explain that.

84
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:30,430
Nine months in,
they shut the film down after a meeting

85
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:32,950
with Disney,
they called it black Friday and then cat

86
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:36,640
moe said something to me that shattered
the myth of the Eureka moment.

87
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,810
Capital said toy story.
The movie you saw was a thousand

88
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:44,800
problems solved and it was like it was
like a bolt of lightning.

89
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,210
I was like,
I get it.

90
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,730
When you do a million dollar deal and an
ad agency,

91
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,730
it's not a big idea.
It's a hundred problems solved.

92
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,760
80 of them are inside your agency.
As you move through every level of that

93
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:59,470
sale,
you get obstacles in front of you and

94
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:04,390
what this means is that if we no longer
depend on the big idea to fall out of

95
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:07,300
the sky and change the world,
we meet more.

96
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,460
We think more,
we research more,

97
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,480
we subtle with small pieces of progress
that add up to momentum.

98
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,170
Finally,
the third myth of genius or creativity

99
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:20,140
that must be shattered if you want to be
more collaborative,

100
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,320
is the myth of the expert.
Now,

101
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:25,660
I believe in involving people in a deal,
strom,

102
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:28,030
who we think are experts on the problem
space.

103
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,030
But if you notice,
I don't want experts on the solution

104
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:36,031
space because most of the great
solutions to vexing problems come from

105
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:39,310
the edges of a domain.
You know people that don't know what

106
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:42,850
they don't know,
so they're not limited by these false

107
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:47,110
constraints that hold people back that
are in the middle of this subject.

108
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:50,680
So the way I like to think about it is
if you could talk to a fish,

109
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,900
if you could,
if the fish could respond,

110
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:55,360
if it could,
and you walked up to a fish in a fish

111
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,830
bowl and you asked the fish,
how's the water?

112
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,240
The fish would look at you puzzled and
ask you what's water?

113
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,380
And that's the problem with experts.
People that are so steeped in a domain,

114
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,370
they don't have the expansive
perspective that allows them to

115
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:14,030
recognize patterns and convergence.
Because every invention,

116
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,070
every solution is really about pattern
or convergence recognition and so it's

117
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:22,640
really important for us to follow the
following mantra and collaboration.

118
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,860
Ideas can come from anywhere.
As a matter of fact,

119
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:32,390
in dealstorming that is one of my four
key ground rules.

120
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:36,710
It's just as important as stay on agenda
and don't distract the person next to

121
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:41,711
you because the problem with the myth of
expert is it leads to not invented here

122
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,520
dismissal of good ideas.
So when you're in a deal store meeting

123
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,950
and someone who's on the edge of the
domain,

124
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:52,820
I'll just give you an example.
Someone out of finance that generally

125
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:55,520
handles something as mundane as revenue
recognition.

126
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:58,910
They come to one of your meetings
because you have a problem related to

127
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:02,540
how you recognize their revenue of this
deal or whatever and you're in the

128
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,690
middle of this conversation about
packaging and they come up with a really

129
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:10,130
novel way to think about how it's built.
You might look at that person and say,

130
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,230
you don't know anything about billing
sales.

131
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,390
You're just a revenue recognition
analyst.

132
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,470
We know billing and sales,
you're about to shut him down for the

133
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,290
rest of the meeting.
And what you don't understand is that he

134
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,950
may have an educational background.
He may have had previous jobs,

135
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,670
he may have a significant other that is
steeped in the billing expertise,

136
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,420
and he's drawing upon all that.
The minute you tell someone,

137
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,130
only experts can weigh in with ideas.
Everyone who's not an expert stops

138
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:39,350
contributing.
And in my experience,

139
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,120
it breaks down collaboration.
