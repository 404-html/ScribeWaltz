1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,950
Mm,

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,730
as an entrepreneur,
I'm such an advocate for everyone to

3
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:12,730
think like an entrepreneur,
whether you want to start your own

4
00:00:12,731 --> 00:00:16,480
business or not.
It's incredibly helpful no matter what,

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,730
and so thinking like an entrepreneur
inside of organizations or if you are

6
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:24,010
starting your own business,
I always say,

7
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:26,230
I love to tell the people around me to
do this.

8
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:30,520
Close Your eyes and take a minute and
think about how you would be doing your

9
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:34,390
job if nobody showed you how to do it,
what surfaces?

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,880
Because if you think about it,
we're all on autopilot.

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,890
We're doing things the way either
someone else showed us how to do it or

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,630
we saw and learned from watching and I'm
real.

13
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:49,750
Change only happens when you do it
different than everybody else.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,680
So all the time I put myself through
mental exercises where I'm like,

15
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:55,600
wait a minute.
I know everybody's been doing it this

16
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:58,270
way for a really long time,
but is that the best way?

17
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:03,390
And I just see what comes up.
I also come across ideas and inventions

18
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:08,440
by going throughout my day looking at
objects and saying,

19
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:12,460
now how could that be better?
And why did the person who first created

20
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:15,220
the,
the gum or the,

21
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:19,560
which gum to me is so fascinating as
someone who started a brand with $5,000,

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,300
had to get an idea out there that didn't
already exist.

23
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:25,330
The footless pantyhose.
I love to think about people who first

24
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:28,660
introduced things to society.
And I think about the guy who did gum.

25
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,310
I'm like,
you want to talk about like,

26
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,200
can you imagine?
I thought I had it tough.

27
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:34,810
This guy's walking around going,
you just chew it.

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,060
You just put this wad in your mouth and
like people will probably like.

29
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,060
And then what?
Don't swallow it.

30
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:42,760
You just chew it like that's a pretty
hard sell,

31
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,630
you know,
at first.

32
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,700
And I,
I think that gum had no flavor and it

33
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:47,650
when it first came out,
so that's even crazier to me.

34
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:51,250
But everything from the pencil to the
fork to the chair,

35
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:56,080
we sit in to the car that we drive.
Somebody originally had the thought and

36
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:59,860
brought it forward to society.
So get off autopilot,

37
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,230
look at everything,
every object in your life,

38
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,940
the way that you do things.
You know,

39
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,280
when you get up and brush your teeth,
is there a better way to brush your

40
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:08,410
teeth?
Is it the right way to be doing it?

41
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,150
Um,
and see what comes.

42
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:15,450
So I started spanx with $5,000 in
savings from selling fax machines door

43
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:19,270
to door in clearwater,
Florida for seven years.

44
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,540
And I started it out of the back of my
apartment.

45
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:26,110
I had never taken a business class.
I'd never worked in fashion or retail,

46
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,500
but I was determined to make this one
particular undergarment for myself and

47
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:35,230
women that filled a much needed void and
fashion.

48
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,520
And it was the most challenging the
first two years to get it made because

49
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,810
no one took me seriously.
I heard the word no for two solid years.

50
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,030
I actually was calling all the hosiery
manufacturing plants and I ended up

51
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:54,010
taking a week off of work and drove
around North Carolina in person begging

52
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:57,430
these people to help make my prototype
and my idea.

53
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,180
And so there were many,
many times in those first two years when

54
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,880
I wrote my own patent.
I went to Barnes and noble and bought a

55
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:05,320
book on patents.
And trademarks,

56
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,630
you know,
I created the packaging on my friend's

57
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:09,720
computer after work.
Um,

58
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,640
you know,
I thought of the name spanx sitting in

59
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:16,150
traffic in Atlanta and went home and
trademarked it with my credit card for

60
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:20,200
$150.
But all of this time I was doing it.

61
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,000
I wasn't sharing it with anybody.

62
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,580
None of my friends or family knew what
my idea was.

63
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,540
And that was really important to my
journey because I didn't want to share

64
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:33,180
the idea just for validation because I
wanted to make sure that I spent any

65
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:38,140
time I had pursuing it instead of
defending it and explaining it.

66
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,080
And I think so often,
so many times people have an amazing

67
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:41,591
idea.
I mean,

68
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:45,550
you have a million dollar or billion
dollar idea in your life and the first

69
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:48,790
thing you want to do is turn to your
right or left at work until a coworker

70
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,290
tell your friends,
tell your husband,

71
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:54,310
your wife and out of love and concern,
you get a lot of feedback that stops

72
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:57,400
that idea right in its moment that it
happened.

73
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,800
And,
um,

74
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,500
but for me,
because I wasn't using a support system

75
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:07,501
on those times that I had doubt,
I ended up really,

76
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,520
I listened to a lot of inspirational and
motivational lectures.

77
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:15,760
And I would second guess myself.
I put those tapes in,

78
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:18,280
I drive around,
I'd have to give myself pep talks.

79
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:21,760
I mean,
it was a real back and forth for me to,

80
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,860
um,
keep believing in myself when no one

81
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:24,580
else was.
