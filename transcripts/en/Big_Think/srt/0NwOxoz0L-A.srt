00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:17,350
I hate interviewing people because they 
very rarely level with you,

2
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,223
and so although it would be interesting 
to sit down with Joseph Stalin and say 

3
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,720
on earth,
did you delude yourself about Nazi plans

4
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,793
for the invasion of the Soviet Union in 
1941 and nearly destroy your own 

5
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:38,030
country?
I don't think he would tell me the truth

6
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,460
on balance.
As an historian,

7
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:41,294
I've always chosen the dead over the 
living for the very good reason that 

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,673
they're.
That letters and diaries are far prefer 

9
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,030
to what they might have told me in an 
interview.

10
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,180
So if you forced my hand,
I'd probably.

11
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,014
I would probably like to spend some time
with Stalin even though he was probably 

12
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:04,100
the most frightening man of the 20th 
century.

13
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:04,963
Most people who've spent time with him 
were filled with fear through 

14
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:08,390
throughout.
Still,

15
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:11,000
it would be a.
It would be a fascinating experience.
