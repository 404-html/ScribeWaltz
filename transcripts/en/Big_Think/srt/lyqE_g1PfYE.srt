1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,810
This is a major issue,

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,770
major ratio for a,
for us or,

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,570
and I think that,
uh,

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,050
we have to move fast forward,
uh,

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,080
in developing new technologies,
which would decrease that dependence of

6
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:24,240
a western societies.
And the world as a whole,

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,440
uh,
on oil and especially oil is coming from

8
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:33,441
regions that are so volatile,
vulnerable and subject to influence of,

9
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:36,630
uh,
extremist trends.

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,960
The more we invest in finding
alternative sources of energy,

11
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,640
uh,
the more,

12
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:44,420
uh,
uh,

13
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:44,960
we,
uh,

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,340
encourage our scientists to focus on
this semester.

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,290
Uh,
the more responsible will be for,

16
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,790
uh,
for our children.

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,253
And,
uh,

18
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,520
I,
uh,

19
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,400
now wearing my hat,
uh,

20
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:01,550
as the ambassador of Israel.
This is one of the areas where a,

21
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:03,290
I hope Israel in the United States
could,

22
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:04,400
uh,
could,

23
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:05,234
uh,
cooperate.

24
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,800
We've done tremendously in so many areas
that are of critical importance sport to

25
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:11,060
the United States.
In Israel.

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,620
We have,
uh,

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,360
uh,
the United States obviously,

28
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:17,000
but Israel to the best of the
scientists,

29
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,690
a worldwide.
And I think that we need to encourage

30
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:23,570
them to sit together and,
uh,

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,190
bring promise to the world,
uh,

32
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:26,024
that,
uh,

33
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,930
our grandchildren will be less
dependence on,

34
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,260
on oil than,
uh,

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,153
than we are.

36
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:40,910
Okay.
