1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,740
Yeah,

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,180
when we bought discovery it was in
terrible shape

3
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,750
and the first priority was to turn the
magazine around and three,

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,760
capture the sense of excitement and it
had say 10 and even 20 years ago and the

5
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:31,881
web was there,
but we let it lie fallow for a bit what

6
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:35,370
we fixed the magazine.
This is important because I wanted the

7
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:38,940
magazine to have its own personality and
energy DNA first.

8
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,710
Then I wanted the web to capture that
and I wanted it to grow into its own,

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,750
its own personality,
which was far more immediate news.

10
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,690
You know,
science news happens fast.

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,430
It's regulatory when it happens.
And most of all,

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,030
I thought the people who had made a
discovery will be most gushing to talk

13
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:03,540
about it right at that time.
So I wanted us to involve a lot more,

14
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:06,450
um,
scientists and I took the va with.

15
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,270
You may have read this in some of the
precedents.

16
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:11,360
I'm that scientists are rockstars in
many ways.

17
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,410
They're rock stars near community.
There's certainly rock stars in their

18
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:16,170
own heads.
Let me tell you from personal

19
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:17,580
experience.
And uh,

20
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,810
they have a lot to say.
Of course,

21
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:20,550
whenever they say it is brilliant and
fascinating,

22
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,810
I mean this is where sometimes the
analogy diverge just because not that

23
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:26,370
many rock stars of that fascinating when
they,

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,570
uh,
opened up,

25
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,960
but every scientist is and every
scientist has a great sense of humor.

26
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:32,650
By the way,
that's something I,

27
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:34,350
I,
I tried to make sure we had some human

28
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:37,590
that website.
So a strategy with the web was same as

29
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,610
it'll be with any magazine I run is be
the personality of the core product,

30
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:50,660
but have your own personality develop
your own life because people consume the

31
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:52,620
internet differently.
They consume print.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,580
I mean the same person at the same time
will shift from one to another but

33
00:01:56,581 --> 00:02:00,240
consume it in different ways in the same
way that a smart person will follow the

34
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:03,870
Financial Times and watch espn within
the same 20 minute span.

35
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,561
You know,
W,

36
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:08,580
w we do approach things differently.
And I thought that the media,

37
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,990
uh,
on the web needed to be more immediate

38
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,940
and more all encompassing and less of
just sort of archived articles.

39
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,990
My first advice would have been that the
print magazine had gone off its rails

40
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,590
and it failed to recognize
that times have changed.

41
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:34,050
It was no longer a novelty to see erotic
pictures.

42
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,090
I'm forget the fact that you can see
pictures in motion on the Internet.

43
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,530
That wasn't it.
It was the novelty and the need to see

44
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:46,830
it and long gone.
My father started that magazine not long

45
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:50,430
after,
and hefner started exactly around the

46
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:54,540
time the national geographic was
considered erotic because it printed

47
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:59,040
nude tribal women from Africa.
And so you put it in context.

48
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,850
That's where this stuff came from.
It arrives in the post aids age of the

49
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,670
mid eighties when it's just,
it's just not new.

50
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,770
Uh,
not new in a graphic way,

51
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,350
something like maximum and loaded before
it.

52
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,090
In England,
these things were new.

53
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:18,240
They were sexy,
they were sourcey.

54
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,090
They were cheeky,
but they had editorial about the rest of

55
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:24,100
men's interest as the dominant part of
the magazine.

56
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,370
And I think penthouse needed to shift in
that direction.

57
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,760
Maximum should never have come along.
Panel should have usurped it.

58
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,560
I'm now the web nonetheless.
It's clearly an awful lot of people

59
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:39,670
going to see it run a system on the web
panels could have provided that I think,

60
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,960
and I don't think it needed to have gone
as hardcore as it did because I think it

61
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,440
sort of stained the overall company.
I would take the magazine very mild,

62
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,320
a far more,
more fun,

63
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,550
Allah maximum or a loaded.
Um,

64
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,920
and I would have,
um,

65
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,310
taken the web to be whatever,
almost subscription,

66
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,730
whatever people wanted a,
you know,

67
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:02,890
again,
you're asking me to advise my dad,

68
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:05,200
which I really desperately wanted to do.
Post facto.

69
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:07,690
It's not important.
We've had some of discussions.

70
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:09,520
He agrees with someone that doesn't
agree with a lot of it.

71
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:11,440
And uh,
my old man's a genius.

72
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:13,410
So where he doesn't agree with me,
I,

73
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,880
I,
I wonder maybe,

74
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,710
maybe he's so something I did.
