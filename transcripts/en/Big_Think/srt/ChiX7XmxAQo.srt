1
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,100
I think it's a mix of both and I think
that that represents the future of what

2
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:15,690
the mixed capitalism kind of model is.
The State Ism that Europe has always

3
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:17,730
practiced,
where corporations and the government

4
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:21,870
are very much in collusion.
And what Asia has learned to do and does

5
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:26,490
itself at Korea and Japan and China are
doing is something that basically if you

6
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:29,280
take European economies and Asian
economies together,

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,790
it puts us in the minority of players
who have been practicing real,

8
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,340
genuine,
free market sort of practices and

9
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:38,430
economics in the last decades.
So I think we're going to learn to do

10
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:43,350
things their way rather than vice versa.
That speaks to a broader critique of

11
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:45,480
globalization,
which is that we don't be,

12
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:48,600
countries don't want to have unmanaged,
unfettered globalization.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,160
They want to regulate,
uh,

14
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:54,200
they want to have capital controls.
They want to direct and channel foreign

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,220
investment in certain ways,
uh,

16
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:59,820
to serve their own national needs and to
build their infrastructure and so forth.

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,610
Um,
that is the model that is prevailing now

18
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:05,100
in Asia because it's proved to have
great payoffs.

19
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,570
Whereas the free market model is what is
blamed correctly or incorrectly for the

20
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:10,560
Asian financial crisis.
