1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,350
Now,
what makes good design is one of the

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,590
biggest questions and one of the hardest
questions to answer sometimes people ask

3
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:16,510
us,
how do you decide to put an object in

4
00:00:16,511 --> 00:00:17,860
the collection of Moma?
Because,

5
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:19,060
you know,
it's a small collection.

6
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,430
It's not huge.
It's about 4,000 objects.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,520
Um,
you can talk about anything you want

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,580
form function,
all of these different equations that

9
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:28,970
have been,
um,

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:29,970
usually,
you know,

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,010
they have been given the world as
possible definitions.

12
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:34,680
But the truth is this,
um,

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,370
it's a very complex recipe.
The world has become more complex and

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,610
you can't any more have an equation with
just two variables.

15
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:43,570
There's like,
you know,

16
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:46,150
it's a differential equation with many
variables.

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,460
What I can tell you is one of the litmus
tests is think if this object would not

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,350
on earth,
would it be a pet?

19
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,240
Would you miss it?
I tell you,

20
00:00:55,241 --> 00:01:00,241
that's really interesting because it
really helps sometimes objects are not

21
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,760
immediately functional.
They're not to be set upon to be used to

22
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:08,650
eat or to be used to turn on the volume.
Sometimes objects just delivery emotions

23
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,520
or are just part of your life.
That's also enough,

24
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,460
you know,
the moment an object seems necessary,

25
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:17,680
then you can move on to judge if it's
beautiful,

26
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:19,600
if it works well,
if it's a fit,

27
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,050
wastes energy.
Those are all considerations,

28
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,940
but the idea of necessity or good
addition to the world really usually

29
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:28,360
works.
