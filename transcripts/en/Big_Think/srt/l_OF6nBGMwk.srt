1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,280
No,
I started this whole project by looking

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:02,930
at Ed.
Okay.

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,350
Keep it in the data and writing the blog
that I did and hopefully will one day do

4
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:08,820
it again very soon.
Um,

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,780
and it's the best data center in the
world cause it's people,

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,890
all strangers.
I'll making judgments of one another all

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,480
probably trying to sleep with each
other,

8
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:20,430
which is also adds a certain,
uh,

9
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,430
pick one see to the whole thing.
Um,

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,591
so you know,
you,

11
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:24,840
you look at the data and you,
you,

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,300
you really get a kind of special window
into people's psyche.

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,230
Got,
we kind of like,

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,700
you could see everything that was going
on in a big bunker on a Friday night.

15
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,230
And you know,
you see that,

16
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,880
that men are the kind of pursuers and
relationships that have four to one

17
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:41,190
ratio.
And it kind of correspondingly,

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:41,760
uh,
you know,

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,090
women because they're getting four
messages to everyone they send out,

20
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:46,830
like they respond a lot less.

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,680
Um,
and,

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,080
and response rates to track directly
with how hot the writer was is a,

23
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,000
but then you also see that once people
start talking,

24
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,880
um,
and they established a rapport,

25
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:58,540
which for Okcupid is for converse at
four,

26
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,890
four messages going back and forth,
that attracting,

27
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:02,400
this kind of goes out the window.
At that point,

28
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:04,530
your personality takes over after the
fourth message.

29
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,720
Um,
you see that,

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,100
uh,
in general women's opinions of men's

31
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:12,190
looks like,
and,

32
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,350
and I get an on average is about half of
what men's opinions of women's looks

33
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:18,330
are.
So they kind of get a 50% discount just

34
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,690
ice cold.
Uh,

35
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,350
on tinder it's actually a lot more,
it's something like a 10,

36
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,350
a 10% discount or 90% discount.
Sorry,

37
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,670
the other way they go at 10th.
Um,

38
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,640
so these environments,
I think this is,

39
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,690
I can't prove this.
My intuition is that the more sexual and

40
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:34,440
environment,
the larger that discount,

41
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,190
um,
from,

42
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,110
from men to women or from women to men.

43
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,010
Okay.
Cuba's userbase in theory on paper is as

44
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:42,510
liberal as you could ever want it to be.
You know,

45
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:45,300
you ask people if they're a Democrat,
if they're progressive,

46
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,261
yes,
yes,

47
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:46,650
yes.
You know,

48
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,071
two,
three,

49
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:47,610
two,
one.

50
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,890
Um,
we're all highly coastal,

51
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,100
very little red state,
very blue and a piece of paper.

52
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:53,331
Okay.
Keep,

53
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:57,120
it should be a very progressive place.
And maybe it is because who knows what

54
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:59,250
the rest of the world is like,
but the data that we have,

55
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:04,251
you know,
black users get three quarters of the

56
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,183
messages,
the,

57
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,170
the,
the positive votes,

58
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,040
uh,
the,

59
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,671
the,
their,

60
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:11,940
their attractions ratings or three
quarters of an average white user,

61
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,103
um,
or,

62
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,690
or Latino user for that matter.
Um,

63
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,640
they reply to about three quarters of
the time it's pretty blanket.

64
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,390
Um,
Asian men also get a similar discount

65
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,480
but not Asian women.
And then you go and you look at at date

66
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:25,950
hookup,
which is a site we run,

67
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,500
um,
you look@thedataformaster.com you'll see

68
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:29,520
the exact same patterns.

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,380
Maybe not in the exact same ratios,
but the same basic up,

70
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,420
down.
Yes.

71
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:35,130
No pattern.
When you compare any race with another

72
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:36,720
race,
and it's kind of suggested,

73
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:40,350
it's kind of a once a universal in the
sense of permanent pattern,

74
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:44,340
but it's certainly like I state of
affairs right now in the American

75
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:44,911
psyche.
I mean,

76
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:46,410
and these three,
those three sites alone,

77
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,430
um,
you know,

78
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:51,510
that they registered maybe 30 million
people in the United States last year.

79
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:55,470
So it's not like some small sample.
I mean that's about half of the single

80
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:58,780
and looking people in the country to my
best guess to the,

81
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,300
if you look at the census numbers,
so you know,

82
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:01,651
it's,
it's,

83
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:03,670
it's pretty meaningful.
Um,

84
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,250
and,
and pretty depressing thing to kind of

85
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,233
digest,
you know,

86
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,360
insofar as like Grindr or any of these
other sites,

87
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,680
they're kind of hookup apps are hookup
apps for gay men.

88
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,480
Okcupid is a little bit more of the
relationship side and we have a very

89
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:17,590
strong,
um,

90
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,390
gay userbase men,
male and female,

91
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:21,310
and you know,
so we get to look at their patterns and

92
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:22,480
you know,
they're basically the same as straight

93
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:23,111
patterns,
you know,

94
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:28,111
which I think is
meaningful in the context of marriage

95
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:31,870
equality because it certainly the pre
marriage relationships seem about the

96
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:33,640
same when you actually go and look at
the data,

97
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,120
which I think is,
you know,

98
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,650
a strong argument for any type of
relationship being held apart legally

99
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,370
for sure.
Right?

100
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,650
Um,
I think the most significant thing that

101
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:45,670
people do on OK cupid because it's a
precursor to going out,

102
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,340
going home with somebody,
getting into a relationship with

103
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:50,470
somebody getting married,
any of that stuff is just messaging.

104
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:52,390
Right?
And we found some kind of crazy stuff

105
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,224
like,
uh,

106
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,390
it doesn't really matter how long your
messages,

107
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:55,771
you know,
the,

108
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:59,050
the best messages are very short,
40 to 50 characters.

109
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,370
But by best,
you know,

110
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:04,690
they're,
they get a reply 2120 2% of the time and

111
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:06,580
kind of all messages get a reply.
Maybe 19,

112
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,740
20% of the time.
So it's not like a massive increase.

113
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,560
Um,
it does help you to spend a little bit

114
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:15,730
more time on your message.
We put a little script to just track the

115
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:18,490
time since the composition window
opened.

116
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,390
And so if you put a little bit more
effort into your master's per character,

117
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,390
uh,
it will yield slightly better results.

118
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,830
But again,
you know,

119
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:27,664
it's,
it's,

120
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,980
it's not a huge effect.
So we were,

121
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,480
we were surprised at both of those
things.

122
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:36,100
I thought that longer messages we either
do super badly or do super well and that

123
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,870
if you spend a lot of time,
at least on your message,

124
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:40,480
it would do better than something you
just like and type it and go,

125
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:41,790
you know,
um,

126
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,540
as a writer,
it's a little sad to say,

127
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,780
but it kinda comes down to just think it
does in person.

128
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,720
There's so much like first impression,
which online is your picture,

129
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,643
frankly,
you know,

130
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,550
um,
that your actual words aren't as

131
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:58,210
relevant as you probably wish they were.
So to that point,

132
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:00,160
you know,
people being the kind of like intuitive

133
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,460
to people and math being the intuitive
genius is that they are the wisdom of

134
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:04,390
the crowds or whatever.
You know,

135
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:08,860
you have like 20% of messages from guys
to women are copy and pasted from other

136
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:10,240
messages that the guys have sent.
They just,

137
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,680
they found something that for whatever
reason either works or typifies them or

138
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,580
that they like or whatever it is,
and they just tricking,

139
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,760
just blast it out,
you know.

140
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,580
Um,
and those actually they do worse.

141
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,830
Um,
they do but not that much worse.

142
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:26,620
They do like 70,
75% of of a normal message,

143
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,930
theoretically unique message.
Um,

144
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,540
and so you get it,
it's very easy to arrive at,

145
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,563
at the,
uh,

146
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,240
results per unit effort is like sky
high,

147
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,290
just cut and pasting.

148
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,360
Right?
And so we at that probably will be

149
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:42,660
something that increases over time and
we don't,

150
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,440
we,
we thought about trying to kind of,

151
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:47,380
it's very easy for us to know whether a
message has been cut and pasted from

152
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,330
another message.
Obviously right now you just compare it.

153
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,640
Um,
but we just decided to let those things

154
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:53,710
go because,
you know,

155
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:54,190
it's,
it's,

156
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,710
it's just the online equivalent of,
of people having their favorite anecdote

157
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:59,600
about themselves,
or this one time they got into this

158
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,210
crazy bar fight or I don't know,
some dumb story how I got the scar,

159
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,480
that kind of thing in a bar or just like
a standard pickup line that you might

160
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:08,030
use.
So it's one of these things that the

161
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:10,640
online version of it seems very weird
and kind of unsavory to be like,

162
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:12,110
oh,
this do just sent the same message to

163
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:15,290
like 40 people.
But I've probably told the same story.

164
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,530
Everybody that I'm friends with,
it's probably heard a large set of the

165
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:19,890
same stories from me,
you know,

166
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,380
and it's something that people just do.

167
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:24,250
Okay.
