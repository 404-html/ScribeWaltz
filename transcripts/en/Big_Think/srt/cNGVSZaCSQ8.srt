1
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,570
I guess the most commendable thing he's
done is,

2
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,250
uh,
not decide the bomb he ran or something.

3
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,010
Like,
I think I'm things he hasn't done that

4
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:22,810
it's commendable that he hasn't done
them,

5
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:23,644
but,
uh,

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,360
he can point to very little,
at least by my standards,

7
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,530
just commendable.
I mean,

8
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:33,490
he's retracted some of the more extreme,
uh,

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,220
Bush positions.
So for example,

10
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:38,260
say on Cuba,
uh,

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,550
Bush imposed condition,
the normal conditions are totally

12
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:46,960
outlandish and ridiculous,
which is why everyone except Israel

13
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:51,190
votes against them at the UN and why the
majority of Americans subject to them.

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,750
But the Bush went way beyond the and
post even harsher conditions and uh,

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,630
uh,
Obama with through some of those,

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,610
uh,
on,

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,010
uh,
nuclear issues,

18
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:08,490
he has indicated that the u s should
return to the main stream of

19
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,950
international affairs,
assign.

20
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,950
They consider again the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty move towards reducing

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,780
nuclear weapons.
Okay.

22
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:23,800
That's a step forward from bushes
position,

23
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:28,540
but it's a step towards the center and
towards the international main stream

24
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,580
and also towards the American public
opinion.

25
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,700
Uh,
and there's a number of other cases like

26
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:36,430
that where the,
the Bush administration,

27
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:39,460
especially its first term was quite
extreme,

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,030
which is why a,
the u s standing in the world fell to

29
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,870
historic lows.

30
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,340
Nothing much because I never expected
anything.

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,030
Um,
I th I was a little surprised by the

32
00:01:57,031 --> 00:02:01,410
fact that he re-instituted uh,
some of the,

33
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,580
uh,
uh,

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,380
the,
uh,

35
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:09,330
judicial practices that
were kind of

36
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,710
unconscionable that Bush,
uh,

37
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,230
uh,
uh,

38
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,420
made use of,
like,

39
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:18,660
he wants preventative detention
permanently.

40
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:19,920
Uh,
uh,

41
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,520
he's been waffling about torture.
He's

42
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,310
refusing to grant a normal criminal
trials to people that they have no

43
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,100
evidence against a,
they claim to have none.

44
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,830
Uh,
things like that have been a little

45
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:40,080
surprising.
I don't think he had to be that extreme.

46
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:40,914
And,
uh,

47
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,870
uh,
in his,

48
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:46,710
uh,
interpretation of actually deviation

49
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:48,030
from any reasonable legal stuff.
