1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,440
We'll we talk about packaging for a 
second look.

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,273
That dot,
the heart of any university is its 

3
00:00:14,511 --> 00:00:18,870
faculty.
And with all of the developments,

4
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:19,704
you know,
if,

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,630
if,
if,

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,473
if you ask me what the major 
achievements of mine now seven years as 

7
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:31,320
president of Nyu are,
um,

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,333
I would say to you that the two 
achievements of which I'm proudest are 

9
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,060
number one,
the development of the faculty.

10
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:41,220
And number two,
the development of student life.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,653
And we have had enormous transformation 
even at Washington square on both of 

12
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:51,651
those dimensions.
The heart of any university is faculty.

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,853
And then the key is to bring in really 
dazzlingly talented students and make 

14
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:00,974
sure they in the faculty interact.
And that's the formula you do that 

15
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,980
everything else spotless.
And what ends up happening in,

16
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:11,010
in,
in today's world,

17
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:11,844
frankly,
is if you have the best faculty and the 

18
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:16,530
most savvy,
smartest students,

19
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:17,843
they tend to yearn for the kind of 
global network university that I just 

20
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:21,780
described.

21
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,613
It emerges out of them.
The university president does not 

22
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:28,650
operate in a command and control 
environment,

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,010
at least this one doesn't.
I think what I'm good at,

24
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,903
sometimes he's noticing what people are 
doing or inclined to do before they 

25
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:37,740
realize it.
And,

26
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,020
and,
and then I'm a good storyteller,

27
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,090
so I tell a story of it that they 
recognize and to which they then behave.

28
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,443
Eh,
so,

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,240
so everything that I'm describing about 
Nyu as,

30
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,123
as,
as this global network university is 

31
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:53,574
something that I've seen emerging from 
my colleagues and from the appetites of 

32
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,144
our students.
We can hardly keep up with the student 

33
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:05,370
demand to study abroad.
Now,

34
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,860
how do you envision a faculty in this 
Global Network University?

35
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,061
I've described?
Well,

36
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:12,480
it,
you know,

37
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,500
this is interesting.
I,

38
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:14,670
I,
um,

39
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,973
I think that we're beginning to see the 
emergence of a group that I called the 

40
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:25,860
cosmopolitans.
What is a cosmopolitan?

41
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,333
Well,
a cosmopolitan is a person who sees a 

42
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,353
life in an institution that allows him 
or her and his or her family to move 

43
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,410
around the world,
experiencing life through the Lens.

44
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:46,814
Not simply a single culture,
but many cultures that it's the kind of 

45
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:54,680
person that enjoys traveling.
It's a kind of person that enjoys,

46
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:55,514
uh,
listening to ideas that a he or she has 

47
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:05,230
never heard before,
whether he or she finds them inscrutable

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,520
or repugnant or wonderfully attractive 
on first hearing.

49
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,240
Okay.
Do it.

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,950
The,
the,

51
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,650
the,
the,

52
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,041
the,
the,

53
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:12,874
the curious now,
a person who comes to Nyu or ready is a 

54
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:22,801
person who's eager to live in an 
environment like New York.

55
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,510
And the hypothesis is in New York is the
miniaturization of the world.

56
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:29,170
We,
we,

57
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:34,170
we already present complexity,
cacophony,

58
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,000
wonderful human cacophony,
not,

59
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,770
not cacophony,
that's grading,

60
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:42,760
but cacophony.
That's just my God aren't human beings,

61
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,653
you know,
amazing.

62
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,960
That kind of cacophony and,
and uh,

63
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,651
you know,
the,

64
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:47,891
the,
the,

65
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:51,670
that's the world that is coming because 
the,

66
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:52,504
the,
the complexity and cacophony of 

67
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:58,540
humankind is only going to become more 
and more apparent.

68
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,910
And the question is,
can we make it symphonic?

69
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,990
So there's a certain group of people,
these cosmopolitans that,

70
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:08,980
that delight in that and,
and have,

71
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:12,430
uh,
an almost insatiable appetite for it.

72
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,170
So the bet is that among the very best 
people,

73
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,080
you know,
call them if you want the no bell or the

74
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:20,914
Tony Level people,
you know that among that there's going 

75
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:25,050
to be uh,
uh,

76
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,953
a substantial.
Now what does substantial meaning in 

77
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:29,500
this case,
in this case,

78
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:32,380
substantial can mean 3%,
4%,

79
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:36,730
5% one in 20.
It doesn't have to be 12 and 20.

80
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,923
Okay.
Cause you're gonna only hire so many 

81
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:41,050
professors even at the largest private 
university in the world.

82
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,400
But,
but if you are the only institution,

83
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,013
or at least if you're the first mover to
become this global network university 

84
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,273
such that a cosmopolitan can become a 
professor at the institution and know 

85
00:04:56,711 --> 00:05:01,120
that he or she can have the benefit of 
moving through the system.

86
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,670
You know,
with a certain amount of collegiality,

87
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,200
you have to check it out with your 
department chair,

88
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:06,340
your dean.
But,

89
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,280
but the,
the,

90
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,500
the assumption is there that you'll be 
allowed to move through the system,

91
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,550
that you'll be able to give your 
children the benefit of growing up,

92
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:20,140
not as American Mano Linguists,
but a growing up on,

93
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,370
you know,
if you want to,

94
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,660
by the time they head off to college,
they could have lived on three different

95
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:27,010
continents,
you know,

96
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:29,000
all,
as part of a,

97
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,430
a kind of fabric of a professional life 
at Nyu.

98
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,473
I actually think that we will attract 
these cosmopolitans to Nyu in a 

99
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,714
disproportionate way and that they're 
likely to be among the most highly 

100
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,240
talented professors.

101
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,083
So I,
instead of seeing the global network 

102
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:50,630
university as presenting,
uh,

103
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,240
uh,
a challenge to faculty recruitment,

104
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,600
I see it as presenting an with regard to
faculty recruitment.

105
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,190
And of course the same thing will be 
true of students.

106
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:03,350
We want to make sure we explain 
ourselves to students.

107
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,693
You know,
we don't want some student coming in 

108
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,420
who's expecting,
uh,

109
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,310
Notre Dame,
you know,

110
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:11,870
look,
now I'm a 50s Catholic.

111
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,500
I root for Notre Dame every Saturday in 
the fall.

112
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,391
Okay.
I'm,

113
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:17,224
I'm programmed that way.
On the other hand is a reason Nyu does 

114
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:21,404
not do division one athletics that is 
deeply connected to its view of itself 

115
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,740
as the Global Network University and a 
complex society.

116
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:35,930
And that is that if you gather people in
a football stadium or a basketball arena

117
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:39,290
all wearing the same colors,
chanting the hymns that the cheerleaders

118
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,070
tell you to chant,
it feels very ozzie and Harriet to us.

119
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,660
It feels very 1950s.
It is not the 21st century,

120
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:48,494
a century of complex community.
And we don't want to give our students 

121
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,650
easy community.
We want to value community,

122
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,173
tell them it's complex and then teach 
them the skills of bridging and 

123
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:08,090
tunneling out of their own micro 
community to those other communities.

124
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,790
So instead of doing division one 
athletics,

125
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,750
we give them exploration flaws in the 
dorms.

126
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,100
What's an explanation?
Fluids.

127
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,483
All right?
We would never do an explanation floor 

128
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,810
based upon the traditional dividing 
things.

129
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:21,650
So we wouldn't have,
uh,

130
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,640
uh,
uh,

131
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,180
racially defined fluor or a religiously 
defined flow.

132
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,840
But you want to live with students who 
love jazz.

133
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,830
You want to live with students who love 
the stock market.

134
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,030
You want to live with students who love 
Broadway theater.

135
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,720
We have 80 exploration floors defined 
like that,

136
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,020
all students from different schools at 
the university.

137
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,153
So there also a sudden now the bridges 
and tunnels united by this interest 

138
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:52,750
faculty member embedded,
uh,

139
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,733
er,
resident assistants embedded to build 

140
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:57,770
programming each week around whatever 
the unifying principle is,

141
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,720
influence silo.
Yes.

142
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,520
Out of the silo.
Yes.

143
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:02,810
Otherwise,
shame on you.

144
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,330
Complex community interrelating 
likewise,

145
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,403
that's what we're going to give you.
And this becomes an attracted to a 

146
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:12,410
certain kind of student.
Not right for every student,

147
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:15,380
but a certain kinds of students.
So you have to explain yourself the fact

148
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:17,060
that you have to explain yourself to 
students.

149
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:21,140
You have to tell them come complexity.
Community.

150
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:22,340
Yes,
but hard community.

151
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,720
That's what we're about.
