00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,083
One of the most inspiring stories that I
have from my journey around the world 

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,900
was when I met a chap called Tony.
I was in Pittsburgh.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,003
I had nowhere to stay.
I'd asked lots of people to help me and 

4
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:12,730
they'd said no,
which is fine.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,040
I mean I had no expectations for people 
to help.

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,870
And I spoke to Tony.
I said,

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,150
can I stay with you?
And he looked at me and he said,

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,670
I'm homeless.
I'm sorry,

9
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:24,850
but I'm homeless.
And I felt a lot of shame,

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,870
but then he said to me,
you know,

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,190
if you want to come and stay with me,
I'll protect you.

12
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,110
I'll help.
I'll feed you.

13
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:36,820
I'll give you some blankets and that'll 
be all good.

14
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,100
And I was in just total shock and I said
to him,

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,900
are you being serious?
He's like,

16
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:41,734
absolutely.
So I spent the night on the streets of 

17
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:47,080
Pittsburgh with one of the kindest men 
I've ever met.

18
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,610
He was a man that had nothing,
literally nothing.

19
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,193
He Fed me,
He protected me and he showed me and 

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,540
opened up my heart and he was such a 
kind man.

21
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:05,620
And what he did was he showed me the 
true wealth is not in our wallets,

22
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,740
but it's in our hearts.
He was a man that had nothing.

23
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,270
I could say that again,
nothing.

24
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:15,070
And he gave me everything and he changed
my life.

25
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,230
Truly,
Tony changed my life.

26
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,363
He changed my life.
He opened up my heart that he made me 

27
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:25,441
realize it's about human connection.
That's where the true beauty of life is.

28
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:26,883
Human connection,
not necessarily what we have in our 

29
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:29,614
wallets.
You can be the richest man in the world 

30
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,760
and still be the poorest man in the 
world.

31
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,690
You can be the poorest man in the world 
and be the richest man.
