1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,870
Surprise you to know that we are still
learning so much about our own solar

2
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:12,210
system.
Even the question about how many planets

3
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:14,130
are there is kind of a funny one like
take Pluto.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,790
Pluto was classified as a dwarf planets
and there are other dwarf planets as

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:18,511
well.
In fact,

6
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:22,350
the largest of the asteroid ceres is now
classified as a dwarf planet.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,400
A lot of these dwarf planets actually
exist far through beyond the orbit of

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:30,480
Pluto and we're just finding them now
and one of my favorite discoveries

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,190
recently has been something called the
Goblin.

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,630
Now the Goblin is a dwarf planet.
It's actually much smaller than Pluto.

11
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:39,750
It's only about a fifth day number two
and it is really,

12
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:43,380
really far out there.
It's in a highly elongated orbit.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,440
The closest it ever gets is about twice
as far away as Pluto is and the farthest

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,580
gets is about 2100 times the distance
from the earth to the sun.

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,200
It goes way,
way,

16
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:59,370
way out there.
This orbit takes it about 40,000 years

17
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:01,260
to go once around the sun.
It's really,

18
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,230
really incredible.
It doesn't surprise me that these

19
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,500
objects are only recently being
discovered because most of them are so

20
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,740
distant.
They are so faint and if they're at the

21
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:12,900
very far part of their orbit,
they're moving very,

22
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:13,920
very slowly,
very,

23
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:15,960
very hard to detect.
Now,

24
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:18,570
the Goblin is really interesting in a
number of ways.

25
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,440
One of the things that I love about it
is that it does actually seem to hint

26
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,660
that there may be something larger out
there,

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,630
and we've been noticing this for the
last couple of years.

28
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,580
These distant icy bodies are called
Kuyper belt objects and often they're on

29
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:35,790
a long gated orbits.
They come close to the sun and by close

30
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,220
I mean about the orbit of Pluto and then
much,

31
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:41,730
much farther away into the very outer
reaches of the solar system.

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,300
We now know of dozens of these objects
and there are probably many more out

33
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:48,810
there we haven't discovered.
The interesting thing is we began to

34
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:51,840
observe how their orbits were aligned in
our solar system.

35
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,310
There's something called Para Helion,
which is the closest pass and object

36
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:58,770
makes to the sun.
And Amazingly,

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,720
all of these objects all over the sky
seemed to have para helium's closest

38
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,900
approaches to the son that were
beautifully lined up together.

39
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,000
There is no reason for that to be the
case if they were independent orbiting

40
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:14,220
bodies,
there's no way they're closest approach

41
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:15,630
to the sun.
It should match.

42
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,830
So the idea is there's a larger body out
there somewhere,

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,060
a larger planet,
and as it orbits it lines up kind of

44
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,430
shepherds,
all these smaller objects into its

45
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:29,760
orbit.
The evidence for this really is pretty

46
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:32,070
compelling.
We don't know of any other way to

47
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:35,460
explain the lined up orbits of these
Kuyper belt objects.

48
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,000
So then the question is,
where is this bigger planet?

49
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,930
Our estimates put it at at least three
to five times the mass of the earth,

50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,730
maybe even a little bit more massive
than that.

51
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,700
It could be something on the order of
the size of Neptune.

52
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,940
This is a big planet we're talking about
and honestly,

53
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:54,750
it's a little embarrassing that we've
missed an entire big planet in our solar

54
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:57,780
system.
We are now so good at detecting planets.

55
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:00,550
We can see them around other stars,
so how has it,

56
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:02,890
we've missed this planet?
Well,

57
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,340
if it really is very far away from us in
its orbit right now,

58
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,830
even a big planet would be tiny to the
most powerful telescopes so we could

59
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:14,650
have missed it.
It also would be moving so slowly that

60
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:16,540
maybe we didn't notice that it was a
planet.

61
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,090
Maybe people assumed it was a distant
star,

62
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,950
so telescopes all over the world are
scanning the sky for any sense that

63
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:27,640
there's an object out there moving very,
very slowly that could be evidence of

64
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:28,570
this giant planet.

65
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,300
Judging from the way these orbits are
lined up.

66
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,020
I think it is very likely there could be
a big planet out there and I am going to

67
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:38,470
be really happy when we have something
else to add to our knowledge of the

68
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:41,290
solar system.
There's also something kind of wonderful

69
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:45,730
happening January 1st of 2019 it's
coming up pretty soon and that is that

70
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:49,120
we're going to visit one of these Kuyper
belt objects for the very first time,

71
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,270
the new horizons spacecraft.
A couple of years ago,

72
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,640
flew by Pluto.
Hopefully you remember the beautiful

73
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:58,990
images of Pluto that it returned.
Then we aimed it at one of these distant

74
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:02,770
Kuiper belt objects.
We call it [inaudible] 69 or it's been

75
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:06,070
nicknamed ultimate Tulay,
which means far this frontier.

76
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,990
Now,
hopefully you're a member of the new

77
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:12,190
horizons spacecraft from his spectacular
fly by Pluto a couple of years ago.

78
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,810
So after it flew by Pluto,
we aimed at even farther out to

79
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:19,180
encounter one of these distant ic
objects.

80
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:24,280
It's the first time we will ever see,
but one of these objects is like after

81
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:27,160
January,
we will finally have a picture of a part

82
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:29,200
of the solar system we've never seen
before.

83
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:36,260
Yeah.
