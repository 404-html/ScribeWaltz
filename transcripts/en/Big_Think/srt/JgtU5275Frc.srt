00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,950
Being a standup comedian is one of the
hardest jobs in the entertainment

2
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:10,900
industry,
if not the hardest job in the

3
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:14,380
entertainment industry,
and it takes a special skill and a

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:18,430
special talent to be able to do that,
to be up there on a stage,

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,460
just you and a microphone and a stool
and be able to be so open and

6
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:26,494
vulnerable,

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,640
you know,
you hear stories.

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,330
I'm comedians are more depressed,
they have more substance abuse,

9
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:37,150
they have more of this,
more of that and you know,

10
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:38,830
they're just a really,
really troubled

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,200
population and I,
I don't necessarily think they're more

12
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:48,310
trouble than anybody else.
The lifestyle of a standup comedian

13
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,830
breeds the depression,
um,

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,740
or it can exacerbate something that's
preexisting,

15
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:58,270
like a bipolar disorder or substance
abuse because what happens is that they

16
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:03,271
are out on the road and they are by
themselves and they're traveling

17
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:08,281
sometimes to these areas that aren't
very popular and aren't very pretty and

18
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,750
working in these dark,
Dank clubs and then going back to a

19
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:14,590
dark,
Dank

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,850
hotel room and it gets very,
very lonely.

21
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:23,650
They don't have their support system.
They don't have much of anything.

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,170
They're there by themselves,
so when you're bored,

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,590
you're going to find something to
entertain yourself with like alcohol or

24
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:31,000
drugs.
And that's,

25
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:34,150
um,
that's when the problems start to

26
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:37,390
persist and then it goes on and on and
on from there.

27
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:38,860
Um,
until they get treatment,

28
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,740
comedians do see comedy as a sort of
self treatment.

29
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,590
A lot of times they think of it as their
therapy.

30
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,010
The problem is,
is that being onstage and performing and

31
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,170
doing your,
your standup a,

32
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:56,720
it's not therapy.
It is definitely therapeutic,

33
00:01:56,721 --> 00:02:01,721
but it is not therapy.
There is that a thought that

34
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,520
if you are successful,
if you make more money,

35
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,950
if you are admired,
um,

36
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,360
if you're recognized out on the street
that all your problems are going to go

37
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:17,090
away.
That is not true.

38
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:18,980
And again,
as we saw with Robin Williams,

39
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,540
his problems did not go away.
Um,

40
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,270
your problems just become different.
Um,

41
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,680
they become,
um,

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,790
different levels of stress,
different levels of depression,

43
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,020
and it's across the board.
If you don't deal with your mental

44
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:34,210
health,
um,

45
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,530
it,
it's not going to go away.

46
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,950
There is a stigma across the board still
with mental health.

47
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,750
Um,
we think that,

48
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,440
um,
we can't solve our own problems and if

49
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:50,850
we go seek help by talking to a
therapist,

50
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:52,250
psychologist,
psychiatrist,

51
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:56,510
any other mental health worker that
there is a problem with us that there

52
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,760
were,
were crazy or something like that.

53
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,790
So I think we'll end can be a useful
resource in terms of,

54
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,830
um,
teaching the world about mental health

55
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:15,901
issues when you come out publicly and
deal with any sort of issue on a certain

56
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:19,130
level,
um,

57
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,130
and talk about it as if it is just
something that is not stigmatized,

58
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,450
then we won't look at it as something
that is bad or evil.

59
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,310
I think what we need to start doing is
really looking at mental health as any

60
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:36,310
other medical condition that we all
experience.

61
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:38,320
You know,
we have a pain in our knee,

62
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,420
pain in our back.
We have diabetes,

63
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:43,510
we have a heart condition.
We go to a doctor or take medication,

64
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,210
eat right exercise,
do what we need to do,

65
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,780
follow through with that.
And um,

66
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,950
and we start getting better.
Hopefully.

67
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,510
Well,
that's the same thing with mental

68
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:53,020
health.
