1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,583
No.

2
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,320
There's so many artists out there all
over the world that are making art

3
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,200
really.
I know this sounds idealistic really

4
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:29,380
because they're artists and they just
have to make things and they come

5
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:33,610
through the art schools where they don't
go to art schools and maybe they are

6
00:00:33,611 --> 00:00:37,150
influenced by a trend or a theory.
Maybe they even want to make money from

7
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:38,710
art,
but they're making art.

8
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,520
I've never really met that many people
that make our just to make money.

9
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:44,320
There's so many other ways to make
money.

10
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,590
This is said with investing in the end,
to hear about these people that want to

11
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:51,220
make money from investing.
You can make so much more money

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,270
investing the traditional ways then you
can from investing in art that there's

13
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,750
certain,
a certain mythology about that.

14
00:00:58,751 --> 00:00:59,531
Even though,
yes,

15
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:01,870
of course some people have made money
from buying art.
