1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,130
I'm inspired,
I think,

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,820
by individuals who strive for 
excellence.

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,163
I think that's how we make progress in 
the world is by individuals who are 

4
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:19,861
capable of expressing their creativity 
and then striving to achieve it.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,520
A striving at a high level of,
of excellence.

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,530
Um,
I'm,

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,320
I'm inspired by people who do drink,
who drew,

8
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,154
who have big ideas and who,
who are undeterred by all the obstacles 

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,400
that are in their path.
Um,

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,910
I'm inspired by big ideas,
um,

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,910
by,
uh,

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,600
people who are able to see beyond the,
the,

13
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,643
the small details of getting through the
day to be able to see a big idea and 

14
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:58,810
then to figure out how to execute a big 
idea.
