1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,060
I think each one it falls into their own
sort of personality of the country and,

2
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:15,210
and,
and uh,

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,990
its own DNA.
You know,

4
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:19,120
New York is very fast moving.
It's very crisp.

5
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:20,980
It's to the point it's all about
business.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,170
I'm New York fashion tends to be like
that.

7
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:25,660
It tends to be no nonsense.
The venues are sensible.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,680
It's an,
an organized,

9
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:28,330
orderly way.
Um,

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,080
America's known for sports where that is
separate pieces that are put together.

11
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:35,080
That's what the American,
I think great contribution to fashion

12
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:37,000
has been.
Um,

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,130
that's where America continues to do and
do well.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,320
The English and London fashion week,
which is currently going on now are

15
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:48,360
known for Eccentricity,
outlandishness theatrics.

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,770
You know,
the land of Shakespeare that gone crazy

17
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:54,070
and wild.
They do it in extraordinary venues.

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,220
Inconveniently late at night,
um,

19
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,320
with great three atrik theatrical and
drama.

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,470
Um,
that's the English point of view.

21
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:03,970
Uh,
the Italians are,

22
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:05,290
get,
are known for craftsmanship.

23
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,590
It's the fabrics.
It's the ability to make beautiful

24
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:11,110
clothing.
That's what the Italians have always

25
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:12,610
known how to do.
Great leather goods,

26
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:13,600
great,
great fabrics,

27
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:16,450
great seems true.
Seeming and tailoring,

28
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,470
you know,
beautiful suits.

29
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,350
That's what Italians too,
and that's what they do best as well.

30
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,480
Um,
and then you get to Paris and that's

31
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:22,960
just,
you know,

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,140
the magic city of all in my mind,
that's where the couture exists.

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,200
Those one of a kind dresses that the
French put out twice a year,

34
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,960
um,
which is really a more of what's factory

35
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:36,370
for extraordinary design in fashion that
is only really in,

36
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:38,150
in Paris and supported by the French
and,

37
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,950
and even by the French government and
the French have in there.

38
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:42,910
I mean,
it's in the water,

39
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:44,800
it's in the wine,
it's in the baguette.

40
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,470
Uh,
uh,

41
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,450
it's in their DNA.

42
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,790
A sense of style,
a sense of that being important.

43
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:51,430
I mean,
French fashion is a port of French

44
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:53,740
culture in the way,
uh,

45
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,860
you know,
the American flag is a symbol of him

46
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:57,880
being an American.
Um,

47
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,510
it's just,
it's just a part of who they are.

48
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,590
I think they do it better than anybody
else.

49
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,930
And I think their level of understanding
of it is,

50
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:07,970
is more sophisticated.
Even if the designer,

51
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,330
Stephanopoulos and Italian Alber bows
isn't,

52
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,440
uh,
isn't Israeli,

53
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:13,840
but they,
they are both designing for houses in

54
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:16,420
power as they are in that culture there
in that world.

55
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,480
Bark Jacobs does Louie Vito.
Um,

56
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,231
it just,
you know,

57
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:23,590
you get absorbed into that French ethos,
that femininity,

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,930
uh,
the understanding of quality and

59
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:29,530
craftsmanship,
the work that are still there that do

60
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:33,760
the beautiful embroidery.
Mr lasage doesn't happen anywhere else

61
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:36,700
on the planet.
And I think along with the French

62
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:38,940
government supporting French fashion,
um,

63
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,160
it's just a city that really does
[inaudible] and they have I think

64
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,720
basically the best clothes on the
planet.

65
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,450
Yeah,
they care about it.

66
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,261
Um,
you know,

67
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:52,130
the French woman traditionally goes and
buys a couple of pieces each season

68
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,830
jacket,
maybe coat new pair of boots,

69
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:58,400
a skirt,
and she wears that for the six months.

70
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:01,240
And she really,
those few things because then with her

71
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,970
old pieces and then get something new in
spring,

72
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:06,730
American women don't tend to buy that
way.

73
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,360
They tend to buy more things.
They don't tend to buy investment

74
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:11,680
pieces.
Uh,

75
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:15,580
I think American women would tend to
make more mistakes and what they buy.

76
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,190
Um,
so there there's a different philosophy.

77
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,150
I think it's in the culture as well.
I think French women are brought up to

78
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,900
care more about that in a way that seems
to be more part of what's important.

79
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:31,630
And that might have to do with something
deeper sociological,

80
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:35,350
psychological relationship that they
have with men in their society.

81
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:37,360
The,
where the female relationship is,

82
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,740
how men view women and sexuality.
And it's a slightly more Latin point of

83
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:43,270
view.
And that in my mind,

84
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:46,930
might indicate why the women are a
little more interested in their style

85
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:47,764
and their,

86
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,360
okay.
