1
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,370
Probably
per value value,

2
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,700
valuing,
paying attention and valuing the moment

3
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,230
and realizing that the present is the
most elusive of all,

4
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,720
uh,
that you know,

5
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,490
you can stabilize the past because there
it is.

6
00:00:31,491 --> 00:00:35,840
Or you can at least stabilize instead of
memories and crawl up the past.

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,020
You can stabilize the future and that
even though you don't know it,

8
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:41,720
you can project a future and you can
dream about it.

9
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,540
Um,
or you can just think of it as an object

10
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,660
of curiosity,
but the president is always disappearing

11
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,140
and,
uh,

12
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,270
there are ways to slow down this flood
of time through a,

13
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:59,210
you know,
just a kind of little meditation or just

14
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:01,040
looking,
stopping and looking.

15
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,910
Uh,
I think that's the thing I value and

16
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:09,560
that's what I probably am in that state,
you know,

17
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:12,230
a half percent of the time.
Um,

18
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,680
but the poetry tries to get into that.
A lot of it does.

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,650
Anyway,
I tries to get into that state and

20
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:23,570
arrest one of those moments.
I have this kind of crackpot analogy,

21
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,990
which is that,
you know,

22
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:26,580
it,
it,

23
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,370
it,
this is old atomic theory,

24
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,980
but if you took an you've take an Adam
and you smash it,

25
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,280
you know,
um,

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,760
uh,
matter is composed of atoms and he

27
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,960
smashed one and it releases this
staggering amount of energy.

28
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,410
Time is composed,
none of Adam's but of moments.

29
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,420
And if you smash a moment,
there is also this amazing release.

30
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,320
And the way to smash a moment is not
with a cyclotron.

31
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,290
Uh,
but through attention you smash your out

32
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,940
by fixing it in your mind.
And,

33
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,480
and uh,
and I think a lot of poetry.

34
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:07,310
Haiku was a very good example.
Most Little Haiku poems are just

35
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:12,311
interested in isolating a moment,
but that moment becomes a tiny thing and

36
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:14,420
suddenly it becomes everything at once.

37
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,600
It's
recovering Catholic.

38
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:22,830
I went to it to a

39
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,060
jesuit,
I went to,

40
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,510
uh,
I went to Catholic school from the first

41
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:31,440
grade right through college,
the full metal jacket of Catholic

42
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:34,950
education when I got to graduate school
is the first time I'd been in a

43
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:38,190
classroom with a female since the eighth
grade.

44
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,180
So,
I'm not sure of the effect of that on

45
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:43,014
me,
but,

46
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,941
um,
it's,

47
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:45,960
I don't have any,
I have,

48
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,790
uh,
I have all the imagery of Catholicism

49
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,970
that's still very vivid and vibrant.
Um,

50
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,430
and,
uh,

51
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,570
the faith is something else.
It's a little,

52
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,590
it's very difficult in a way to maintain
a connection to a church that is so full

53
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:05,404
of,
uh,

54
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,640
flaws and uh,
and hierarchical.

55
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:11,390
The structured,
uh,

56
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,480
church,
um,

57
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Martin Sheen I think summed it up best
when he said that.

58
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,980
He said,
I don't believe in God,

59
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,990
but I believe that Mary was his mother.
Uh,

60
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,751
you know,
in other words,

61
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:26,770
you can,
you can,

62
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,670
you can lose contact with the theology,
but you can never lose contact with the,

63
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,230
the iconography,
the imagery,

64
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,250
dre,
decency.

65
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,110
Well,
uh,

66
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,650
uh,
courtesy is very much a priority,

67
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,510
but I think I keep going back to
wordsworth,

68
00:03:56,511 --> 00:03:57,350
but he,
he's,

69
00:03:57,351 --> 00:04:00,590
he's,
he's suggested are the better part of

70
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:02,780
our lives.
This sort of thread that connects our

71
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:07,781
lives is,
is composed of what he calls a little

72
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,230
nameless,
unremembered acts of kindness and of

73
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:15,440
love.
And it's very important that these acts

74
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:17,090
are unremembered.
You know,

75
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,880
if you do something consciously for
someone and remember it,

76
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:20,841
uh,
well,

77
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:23,210
I mean,
and an endowment is a nice thing to do

78
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:25,430
and get your name on the gymnasium or
the library.

79
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,100
Um,
that's one kind of contribution,

80
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,550
but I'm equally as important,
I think to t to stitch your days

81
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:36,650
together,
uh,

82
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,370
is just a kind of moving through the
world with the kind of courtesy.

83
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,100
Uh,
I,

84
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,250
I think that leads to,
it seems almost trivial in terms of

85
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,620
like,
like a point of etiquette,

86
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,820
but I think courtesy leads to a much
bigger things,

87
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,080
but you have to start with

88
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,600
tiny dress.
