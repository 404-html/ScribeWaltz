1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,080
It doesn't disturb me at all.
I'm,

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,460
I'm always
believe in talking to my opponents and

3
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,580
stayed friends.
I mean,

4
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:26,850
you know it just so the people I
disagree with most strongly,

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,880
I'm actually quite friendly with this.
Nope.

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,890
It doesn't make.
It doesn't disturb me if they disagree

7
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:39,891
with me.
Well,

8
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:42,090
I don't know.
It changes from week to week.

9
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,870
What I've noticed is there's been a
strong increase in skepticism and just

10
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:51,120
in the last couple of weeks,
and

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,330
I suppose it has something to do with
all this snow storms we've been having.

12
00:00:57,331 --> 00:01:02,331
I don't know,
but certainly I've seen the politicians

13
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,390
becoming much more skeptical just
recently.

14
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,210
That's across.
I welcome that.

15
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,650
I think that that that's
actually means they're recognizing the

16
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:16,824
way things are.

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,950
Well,
there are all sorts of ways.

18
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,990
It was a couple of farmers in Minnesota
I was just reading about who decided to

19
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:37,591
change from feed lots to grass.
Was there raising beef that there.

20
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,150
These are farmers who are just raising
cows for beef,

21
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,020
add a certain amount of milk as well,
and they decided to switch from feed

22
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:53,470
lots,
which is of course the fashionable way

23
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:57,320
of raising cows.
You keep them on a very crowded feed lot

24
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,480
and feed them on call,
so you're growing corn to feed to the

25
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:04,090
animals.
Instead of that,

26
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:09,070
you put them out to grass,
but you manage the grass in a clever way

27
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:14,730
with moving fences around.
So they actually eat the grass much more

28
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:18,130
evenly.
It turns out this pace and,

29
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:20,260
and uh,
it's uh,

30
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,250
they're doing extremely well just going
back from feed lots to grass and it has

31
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:33,661
a big effect on the carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere in proportion to the area

32
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:36,070
that they're using.

33
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,880
That means that if the whole of the
Middle West would do this,

34
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,550
it would make a very substantial
difference to the carbon dioxide in the

35
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:48,010
atmosphere.
And so that kind of,

36
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,570
that's the sort of practical thing you
can do just managing the land more

37
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:55,440
intelligently.
And this,

38
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,050
it's rather like building dikes around
new orleans.

39
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,913
I mean,
it's,

40
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,520
it's not all that spectacular,
but it actually works and

41
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,560
so changing from feed lots to grass,
I think it's sort of,

42
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,500
it doesn't solve the whole problem,
but it solves a certain chunk of the

43
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:17,020
problem and there are other things you
can do.

44
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,050
Just doing less plowing makes a huge
difference.

45
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,530
Plowing is one of the main causes of
carbon going into the atmosphere because

46
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,960
you expose the soil to the atmosphere at
means.

47
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,960
The carbon gets oxidized,
becomes carbon dioxide and floats off

48
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:44,650
into the atmosphere.
So if you can find without plowing,

49
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,520
it actually helps and doesn't matter how
much coal and oil burning that still

50
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:53,500
helps.
