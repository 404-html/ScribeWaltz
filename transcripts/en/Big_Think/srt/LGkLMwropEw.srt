1
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,820
My favorite job,
I,

2
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,780
my purpose in life always has been to
avoid work.

3
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,090
And I hear these people saying I work
hard and I pay my taxes,

4
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:27,490
but you're an asshole.
Uh,

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,360
because in my readings,
if I,

6
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:34,690
if the Bible is correct,
and I'm not a biblical scholar by any

7
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:37,000
means,
but whatever,

8
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,160
Adam and eve did,
I don't know what it was,

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,460
but they did something that apparently
and annoyed the guy that made them and

10
00:00:44,921 --> 00:00:49,450
they got booted and she was sentenced to
bear children in pain in labor,

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,170
which I didn't mention that we'll have
to grow up to be teenagers.

12
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,050
And he was sentenced to,
uh,

13
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,950
work in the fields where the skin would
be pardoned by the sun and he's hands

14
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:08,281
will be torn by the thorns and thistles
of the field and we should earn his pred

15
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:09,880
by the sweat of his brow.

16
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,250
So that to me is work,
you see.

17
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,950
So I always have,
I didn't do it.

18
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:17,260
He did.
So that him paid the price.

19
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,200
All my sins,
that's called original sin.

20
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,650
All mine are mine and all my sins are
original.

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,180
So I've avoided work all my life.
You see?

22
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,580
So I'm like a,
um,

23
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,530
I'd like it be,
I call from flower to flower.

24
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:41,070
I go where the nectar is and then we
make life jus that a lot of money.

25
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,370
So whatever.
I'm broadcasting,

26
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,630
I like it when I'm writing,
but I'm broadcasting.

27
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:53,440
I can't wait to hear what I have to say
when I'm writing.

28
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,810
I thoroughly enjoyed.
It just goes off.

29
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:59,440
I write in Longhand and just goes on and
on and on.

30
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,160
When I was in the saloon business,
I just would greet people and talk to

31
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:06,910
them and avoid taxes and getting behind
the bar.

32
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,210
Uh,
what else?

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,840
I ran for governor of New York and,
uh,

34
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:13,960
I thoroughly enjoy campaigning,
uh,

35
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,440
at all of that.
Mostly anything to do with the

36
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,990
socializing,
entertaining,

37
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:22,690
having a chat.
There is nothing like it.

38
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,350
And I'm curious to know what's over the
other side there

39
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,950
because people,
uh,

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,210
people don't deal with thing is that
people don't die here.

41
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:38,260
You see,
in America,

42
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,630
they,
they pass away,

43
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,860
they pass on the leavers,
they've gone no longer with us.

44
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:49,210
Third piece there with the Lord,
the six feet hundred,

45
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,980
they've kicked the bucket.
And,

46
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,630
uh,
and,

47
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:57,380
and the other thing is they don't allow
a dying on the,

48
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,460
nobody ever says that they don't evil on
the highway.

49
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,890
They won't allow you to die.
I am said,

50
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,370
no passing to give you a ticket if you
die and die.

51
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,800
I would say I'm more spiritual.
You see,

52
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:20,801
the way I look upon organized religion,
organized religion,

53
00:03:21,171 --> 00:03:22,890
I'm a,
I was a victim of that too.

54
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,900
You know,
um,

55
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:28,130
mythology and of cruelty and,
uh,

56
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,590
uh,
absurd stuff.

57
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,410
An organized religion has all the facets
of organized crime except the compassion

58
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,190
of organized crime.
They will only break your legs.

59
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,610
What does organized religion we'll send
you to hell forever.

60
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,860
We have to think about all that stuff of
snakes and paradise and even,

61
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,710
you know,
making the connection between why.

62
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,450
Okay.

63
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,520
The,
the guy,

64
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:05,521
whoever was made these Adam and eve and
makes all of these animals,

65
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,980
all the cows and sheep and pigs and
elephants and rhinoceros and rabbits and

66
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:17,731
the hare is and moles and octopuses and
salmon and trout

67
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,850
and snakes

68
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,410
and of all the animals that he or she,
whatever creative who brings one into

69
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,010
paradise?
The snake.

70
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,800
No.
You'd think you'd bring a a nice though

71
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:42,580
to dog or her poodle or something at the
paradise to keep Adam and Eve,

72
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,780
uh,
that company know a bloody snake and

73
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,930
instead of a cat,
maybe we just take the cab would have

74
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:54,931
been no snake and not alone that,
but a talking snake who said,

75
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:56,500
how are you eat?
I'm fine,

76
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:58,450
thank you.
How bout this apple?

77
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,960
Oh really?
You're all,

78
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,060
let me try it.
Oh,

79
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,330
Hey Adam.
This is great apple.

80
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,910
So she hands him the apple and they get
tossed out and he has to go on work.

81
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,720
She has to bear children.
And the snake,

82
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:19,570
they say he has to crawl on his belly
for all eternity and eat dust.

83
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,360
Now if he was a serpent before,
how did he get wrong?

84
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,950
So the banished him and tossed him out a
center to Ireland and then the,

85
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:34,030
say Saint Patrick came and vanished all
the snakes from Ireland.

86
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,380
So he might have,
because I think they all came here and

87
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,090
took over the Saint Patrick's Day
parade.

88
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,193
That's my ideal.

89
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,740
Well,
I,

90
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,090
uh,
I am an alcoholic,

91
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:51,720
as I said,
and um,

92
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,800
and it is a harvard,
we caught a disease,

93
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,290
an explanation,
but not an excuse.

94
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,860
So once I know I'm an alcoholic than it
is by a fountain obligation [inaudible]

95
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,090
to see what I can do about healing
myself.

96
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,830
Now there's no recovery from alcoholism.
It is an incurable disease.

97
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,870
And it also is a disease which tells you
you don't have a disease.

98
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,440
It tells you I am your friends and all
you need at any given time is that it'll

99
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,440
drinky pool to make life good and all of
that.

100
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,290
So then you'd take the little drinky
pool and the next thing you know,

101
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,310
you're consumed about 40 drinky pose and
you're acting like a complete ass or

102
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,920
that you were before you had the drink
depaul.

103
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,580
So,
uh,

104
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,030
I discovered that and I said,
I would never,

105
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,140
I would never become an alcoholic like
my father because my father deserted us,

106
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,980
but diseases that don't,
there's no let up.

107
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,100
They get you somewhere or another.
So the alcoholism got me and I ruined my

108
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:16,010
first marriage with drinking and the
lying,

109
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,870
the seat infidelity and all of that,
the whole bloody thing there was,

110
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,280
I was the complete one,
alienated my first wife.

111
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,310
And although I never,
I was not abusive in the physical sense

112
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:32,020
in that I did never,
uh,

113
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,150
never a hillsborough hit or like manny,
I'm,

114
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,960
I was lucky the,
I,

115
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:42,961
I'm not addicted to that kind of thing,
but I also alienated my children from

116
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:45,650
that marriage.
I'm on good terms with them now.

117
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,570
And,
uh,

118
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,120
I've been married for 45 years to my
second wife.

119
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,920
I've been sober for 25.
And,

120
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:56,600
uh,
every day I am very grateful that I,

121
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,500
um,
that I don't drink and it's one day at a

122
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:02,120
time.
That's all there is to it.

123
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:02,980
And I,
uh,

124
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,120
so I don't have to worry about it.

125
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,940
All I do is okay.
I don't,

126
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,520
I do not have to drink.
And if I feel like it,

127
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,200
I postpone it for 10 minutes.
And I that where I'll find something

128
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:20,201
else to do in the meantime.
But alcoholism is a dread and offer and

129
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:26,141
fatal disease.
And I've seen so many horrible and offer

130
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:32,230
results and consequences of people.
Um,

131
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,440
practicing alcohol ism it's a murder.
I've seen that.

132
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,320
I've seen a lot of suicides,
a lot of strange since set particularly.

133
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,690
You get a lot of thievery and,
and,

134
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,360
and the whole thing is involved.
The lying there,

135
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:55,330
we were great.
We're liars.

136
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,620
And then a lot of people abuse their
children.

137
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,470
And,
um,

138
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,260
more than hitting,
so many people will abuse the children

139
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:06,990
sexually as well.
And that is,

140
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:08,280
uh,
that's that,

141
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,210
that's,
it is a family disease and that's one of

142
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:15,870
the horrors of,
at when kids are abused sexually in the,

143
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:19,770
seems to be more of it now than ever.
And I find that,

144
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,850
um,
I find that so sad that that happens.
