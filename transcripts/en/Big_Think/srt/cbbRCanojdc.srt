1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,570
I don't think anybody should care about
the gossip.

2
00:00:07,571 --> 00:00:09,820
It put it on my site.
You know,

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,260
you don't have to read it.
The great thing about it is it's,

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,320
I like to think of my website.
It's like the Mcdonald's of the

5
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:20,620
Internet.
A lot of people love to criticize

6
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:21,910
McDonald's,
but yeah,

7
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:25,990
it's still really popular and I love the
French fries.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,400
I think gossip is

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,690
people's interest in gossip is nothing
new.

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,590
It's been around for decades.
It's been around for centuries.

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,890
The only thing that's changed is the
media has become aware that a celebrity

12
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:55,481
news can be profitable,
so gossip or celebrity news is now

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,320
mainstream news.
I don't know,

14
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:06,750
but I know that celebrity news is
mainstream news.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,920
I know that Anderson Cooper has
discussed Lindsay Lohan many times and

16
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:16,620
he probably hates it,
but you know what?

17
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,650
He will continue to discuss about
celebrity news and he will continue to

18
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:26,691
talk about Lindsay Lohan.
I would not insult the mainstream news

19
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:30,900
by saying that it's a form of glorified
gossip.

20
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:33,510
No,
I still think that mainstream news is

21
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,270
very valuable.
Invaluable.

22
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,590
Okay.

23
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:43,000
Mainstream news is just doing their job.
If they weren't making money,

24
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,300
they wouldn't be able to provide us with
the news.

25
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:51,460
So they have to have that celebrity
element there so that they can get

26
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:52,990
ratings.
But,

27
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,640
you know,
not all the times I,

28
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:56,830
you know,
there are those shows that have nothing

29
00:01:56,831 --> 00:02:00,700
to do with politics,
but there's been a shift definitely over

30
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:04,900
the last five or 10 years where there is
a lot more celebrity content in

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,960
mainstream news.
I think celebrity news is only a

32
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:14,550
positive thing.
I look at it as,

33
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,620
um,
aspirational.

34
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,610
It's a great escape for people and a lot
of them love to fantasize.

35
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:21,771
Like,
oh,

36
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:24,570
wouldn't it be great if I were famous to
a,

37
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:26,540
wouldn't it be great if I can,
um,

38
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,210
go to that shop and buy that fancy
clothes that Kim Kardashian buys.
