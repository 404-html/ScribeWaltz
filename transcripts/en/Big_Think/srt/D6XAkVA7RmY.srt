1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,040
We have found the Higgs Boson.
So then the next question is,

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,870
what's next?
Well,

3
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:10,530
the large Hadron Collider,
this machine that is 20,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,450
uh,
27 miles in circumference costing $10

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,320
billion is big enough to create the next
generation of particles.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,540
So the Higgs Boson in some sense is the
last Hurrah for the old physics,

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,880
the old physics or what is called the
standard model,

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,090
which gives us quarks and electrons.
The new theory is going to take us into

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,520
dark matter.
Now we know dark matter exists.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,240
Dark matter is invisible.
So if I held it in my hand,

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,340
you wouldn't see it.
In fact,

12
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:45,300
it would go right through my fingers,
go right through the Rock,

13
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:48,090
underneath my feet and go all the way to
China.

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,220
It would be reversed direction and come
back from China all the way here to New

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,870
York City and go back and forth.
So dark matter has gravitational

16
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:02,100
attraction,
but it is invisible and we are clueless

17
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,130
as to what dark matter really is.

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,550
The leading candidate for dark matter
today,

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,900
it's called the sparkle.
This particle is the next octave of the

20
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:14,790
string.
Now look around you.

21
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,820
Everything around you we think is
nothing but the lowest vibration of a

22
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:22,710
vibrating string.
The lowest octave in some sense.

23
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,960
But a string of course has higher
octaves,

24
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:28,320
higher notes.
We think that dark matter could in fact

25
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,340
be nothing but a higher vibration of the
string.

26
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,060
So we think that 23% of the universe,
which is,

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,850
which is the dark matter,
is contribution to the universe,

28
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,160
comes from a higher octave of the
string.

29
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:46,730
Now the standard model which we have
ample verification of only represents 4%

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,690
of the universe.
So the universe of atoms,

31
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,610
protons,
neutrons,

32
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:57,870
neutrinos.
That universe only represents 4% of what

33
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:01,770
there is.
23% is dark matter,

34
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,280
which we think is the next vibration up
of the string.

35
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,270
And then 73% of the universe is dark
energy.

36
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,660
Dark energy is the energy of nothing is
they energy at the vacuum between two

37
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:17,010
objects.
In outer space,

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,130
there's nothing,
nothing except dark energy,

39
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,010
dark energy,
which is pushing the galaxies apart.

40
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,220
So when people say if the universe is
expanding,

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,700
they say two things.
What's pushing the galaxies apart?

42
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,320
And what is the universe expanding into?
Well,

43
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,960
what's pushing the galaxies apart is
dark energy,

44
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,850
the energy of nothing.
Even vacuum has energy pushing the

45
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:44,760
galaxies apart.
And then what is the universe expanding

46
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:46,110
into?
Well,

47
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:50,580
if the universe is a sphere of some sort
and we live on the skin of the sphere

48
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,810
and the sphere is expanding,
what is a sphere expanding into?

49
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,590
Well,
obviously a bubble of balloon expands

50
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:01,990
into the third dimension,
even though the people living on the

51
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:05,500
balloon or two dimensional.
So when our universe expands,

52
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,740
what does that expand into?
Hyperspace a dimension beyond what you

53
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,610
can see and touch.

54
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,790
In fact,
string theory predicts that there are 11

55
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,990
dimensions of hyperspace,
so we're nothing but a soap bubble

56
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,080
floating in a bubble bath.
I was soap bubbles and so in some sense

57
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,050
the multiverse can be likened to a
bubble bath.

58
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,820
Our Universe is nothing but one bubble,
but there are other bubbles.

59
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,680
When two bubbles collide,
that could merge into a bigger bubble,

60
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,710
which could be the big bang.
In fact,

61
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:46,711
that's what probably the big bang is or
perhaps a bubble vision than half and

62
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:51,400
split off into two bubbles.
That could be the big bang or perhaps

63
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:53,920
the universe popped into existence,
out of nothing.

64
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,230
That is also a possibility,
and so the universe could essentially be

65
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,860
nothingness which was unstable and
created a soap bubble.

66
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,660
Now you may say to yourself,
well,

67
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,050
that can't be right because that
violates the conservation of matter and

68
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:08,830
energy.

69
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,110
How can you create a universe from
nothing?

70
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,650
Well,
if you can't calculate the total matter

71
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,210
of the universe,
it is positive.

72
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,330
If you calculated the total energy of
the universe,

73
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,080
it is negative because of gravity.
Gravity has negative energy.

74
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,330
When you add the two together,
what do you get?

75
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,120
Zero.
So it takes no energy to create a

76
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:33,700
universe.
Universities are for free.

77
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,190
A Universe is a free lunch and then you
had assault.

78
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,720
Well,
that can't be right because positive and

79
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:43,300
negative charges don't cancel out.
Therefore,

80
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:45,130
how can the university made out of
nothing?

81
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,340
Well,
if you calculate the total amount of

82
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:51,400
positive charge in the universe and
khaki,

83
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,650
the total amount of negative charge in
the universe,

84
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,990
and you add it up,
what do you get?

85
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,920
Zero.
The universe has zero charge.

86
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,890
Well,
what about spin galaxies spin,

87
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:05,170
right?
But they spin in all directions.

88
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,570
If you add up all the spins of the
galaxies,

89
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:09,490
what do you get?
Zero.

90
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,700
So in other words,
the universe has zero spin,

91
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,970
zero charge,
and zero matter energy content.

92
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,300
In other words,
the universe is for free.

93
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:23,830
Okay.
