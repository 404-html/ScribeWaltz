1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,740
Policy has been passed overwhelmingly
for innovation agenda.

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,640
We even with the opposition of the
Republican leadership,

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,800
oh,
we had a majority of the Republicans

4
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:17,130
voting with us.
So from a policy standpoint is passed

5
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:19,440
the congress,
it was called the compete act.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,170
It's paying for it.
That is a problem for the president of

7
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:24,600
the United States.
They don't want to pay any bills.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,733
And so,
um,

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,800
uh,
these investments in research and

10
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:33,360
development and education that are
essential to the innovation that our

11
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:36,790
country needs need to be paid for.
Uh,

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,990
we,
we put some money of that into the

13
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:44,190
supplemental calling an emergency,
put it in the supplemental.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,970
Not Enough,
but a signal that science and research

15
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:50,190
and development is essential to
innovation.

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,280
And we intend to follow through.
