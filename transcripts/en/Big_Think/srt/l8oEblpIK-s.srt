1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,370
I'm tempted to say smart,
creative people have no particularly

2
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:14,820
different set of character traits than
the rest of us,

3
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:18,990
except for being smart and creative and
those being character traits.

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,110
And then on the other hand,
I wrote a biography of Richard Fineman

5
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:27,000
and a biography if Isaac Newton.
Now there are two great scientific

6
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:32,001
geniuses whose characters were in some
superficial ways,

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,180
completely different.
Isaac Newton was solitary,

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,950
antisocial,
I think unpleasant.

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,820
I'm bitter,
fought with his friends as much as with

10
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:54,690
his enemies.
Richard Fineman was gregarious,

11
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,720
funny,
a great dancer,

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,550
uh,
loved women.

13
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,350
Isaac Newton,
I believe,

14
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:05,190
never had sex.
Richard Fineman I believe had plenty.

15
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,850
Um,
so you can't generalize there.

16
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:11,430
On the other hand,
they were both,

17
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,460
as I tried to get in their heads,
understand their minds,

18
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:19,080
the,
the nature of their genius.

19
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:22,980
I sort of felt I was seeing things that
they had in common and,

20
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,060
and they were things that had to do with
aloneness.

21
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,050
Um,
Newton was much more obviously alone

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,600
than fineman,
but fineman didn't particularly work

23
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:35,850
well with others.
Uh,

24
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,290
he was known as a great teacher,
but he wasn't a great teacher.

25
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:43,230
I don't think one on one.
I think he was a great lecturer.

26
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,090
I think it was a great communicator.
But when it came time to make the great

27
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:52,950
discoveries of science,
he was alone in his head.

28
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,550
And now I'm talking to,
when I say he,

29
00:01:56,551 --> 00:02:00,840
I mean both fineman and Newton.
And this applies also I think to the

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,600
geniuses,
um,

31
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,410
that I write about in the information.
Charles Babbage,

32
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,600
Alan Turing,
Ada Byron,

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,840
they all had the ability to concentrate
with a sort of intensity that is

34
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,850
hard for mortals like me to grasp a kind
of,

35
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,410
um,
passion,

36
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,580
passion for abstraction.
Uh,

37
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,790
that doesn't lend itself to
easy communication.

38
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,490
I don't think.
