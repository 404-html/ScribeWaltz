1
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,640
The true crime stuff,
I think it has good points and bad

2
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:11,490
points,
good points because it is literally

3
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:15,660
saving people's lives when you're
talking about cases where you have

4
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:20,550
innocent people sentenced to death,
you have innocent people are doing life

5
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:25,551
without parole and it happens way more
often than people have any idea.

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,040
Uh,
a guy named Bryan Stevenson who works

7
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,710
with the southern poverty law center,
I was talking to him one time and he

8
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:36,600
said that they now estimate that maybe
as many as one out of every 10 people

9
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:40,530
executed are innocent.
Now if one out of every 10 planes

10
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:42,810
crashed,
nobody would fly anymore.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,380
Everybody would demand that something be
done before they got on another plane.

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,450
But most people don't know anyone that
are and they're not connected in any way

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,880
to the death penalty.
So it's sort of just being swept under

14
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:55,020
the rug and a lot of ways.

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,040
So the true crime stuff is bringing
stuff like that into mainstream

16
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,020
attention.
Uh,

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,780
it's saving people's lives.
On the other hand,

18
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:06,480
you have the other stuff,
the really tawdry,

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,210
and I can't think of a case right off
the top of my head,

20
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:13,650
but you know,
just people like to sort of wallow in

21
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:15,780
the darkness of humanity a little bit,
you know,

22
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:19,920
say people who want to read stuff about
Richard Ramirez,

23
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:21,660
the night stalker guy,
you know,

24
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,200
stuff like that,
that sort of goes the other route.

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,850
You know,
I think when you,

26
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,920
whatever you focus on is going to sort
of dictate the direction that your life

27
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:34,560
moves.
If you focus on things that inspire you,

28
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,720
that uplift you,
that raise you up,

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,670
you're going to be a happier person.
If you're focusing more on the basest

30
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,920
just you know,
bottom dregs of human activity,

31
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,320
then you're probably not going to be a
very happy person.

32
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,690
You know,
it's gonna manifest in depression and

33
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:53,300
despair and,
uh,

34
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,260
things like that.
So,

35
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,290
you know,
I see the good points of

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,340
true crime and I see the bad points of
true crime.

37
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,460
For me personally,
I tend to stay away from it.

38
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,850
I honestly have not even seen the
paradise lost documentaries.

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,610
I tried to watch,
watch them,

40
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,830
I made it through 15 to 20 minutes of
the first one and I could understand why

41
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:20,520
it had such a big impact on people
because when I was watching it,

42
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,540
it felt like being in the courtroom,
it was like experiencing it again.

43
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,330
And for me that was the last thing in
the world that I wanted.

44
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,780
That was,
it ate up 20 years of my life.

45
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,900
So the last thing I wanted to do is go
back there at the same time.

46
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:38,340
I'm grateful that so many other people
did watch it and were affected by it and

47
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:41,280
came to our aid because it saved my
life.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
But that doesn't mean I want to watch
it.

49
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,780
The hardest parts of being in prison,
the worst parts to deal with or just the

50
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:50,670
sheer brutality of it.
You know,

51
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,790
there were times when I was beaten so
bad that I started to piss blood.

52
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,140
Uh,
you know,

53
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,710
they're not going to spend a lot of time
and money and energy taking care of

54
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,950
someone,
plan on killing.

55
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,890
So it's not like you're going to see a
real doctor or a real dentist,

56
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,700
you know,
there's,

57
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,770
at one point I'd been hit in the face so
many times by prison guards that had

58
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,010
caused a lot of nerve damage in my
teeth.

59
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,780
So I was in horrendous pain.
Your choices are live in pain or let

60
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:16,690
them pull your teeth out.
I didn't want them to pull my teeth out.

61
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:21,310
So I had to find techniques that would
allow me to cope with the physical pain.

62
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,700
That was probably the biggest thing that
kept pushing me forward to learn more

63
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:32,020
and more and more about magic because I
had to find ways just to survive.

64
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,240
Um,
Magik spelled with a k at the end.

65
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,720
They may gick.
Uh,

66
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,790
the reason it has a k is to
differentiate it from sleight of hand.

67
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,280
You know,
a song assistance in half,

68
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,960
pulling rabbits out of hats,
things like that.

69
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,580
For the entire point of high magic.
It is a path that leads to the same

70
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:51,580
things at eastern traditions refer to as
enlightenment,

71
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,970
which is the disillusion of the self.
The form that I practice a derived for

72
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:03,250
the most part from the late 18 hundreds
in London,

73
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,100
you had a group of people,
uh,

74
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,390
they called themselves a hermetic order
of the Golden Dawn.

75
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:10,150
Some really intelligent people.
Uh,

76
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,360
the poet web gates was a member.
What they set out to do was look into

77
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,500
all religious traditions in the world
and get to just the practices,

78
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:23,050
you strip away the dogma,
the belief systems,

79
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:26,200
things like that and get to just the
practices and they wanted to figure out

80
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,910
what works,
why it works,

81
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:30,070
how it works,
and how we can make it work better.

82
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,750
And it's ideally suited to people in the
West because it uses,

83
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:35,600
you know,
like I was saying,

84
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,650
Christian Judaic things of that nature.
Iconography.

85
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,360
So it's things that are really deeply
ingrained in our psyches already.

86
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,223
You know.
Um,

87
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,500
when I was in prison,
I actually also received ordination in

88
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,330
the Rinzai Zen tradition of Japanese
Buddhism.

89
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,210
It was a tradition that used to train
the Samurai in ancient Japan.

90
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,630
So I sat zen meditation for years and I
still feel like I got more out of

91
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:02,680
ceremonial magic and month than I did
zen in years.

92
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:06,010
Just because it is more it.
It deals with things that are more

93
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:09,460
deeply ingrained in the western psyche
than eastern traditions.

94
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:11,020
Do you know,
think of it,

95
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:13,060
for example,
think of yourself as a cup of water.

96
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,950
Now,
if you just leave a cup of water sitting

97
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:17,410
somewhere for a long period of time,
it starts to stagnate.

98
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,100
It's going to accumulate debris.
Maybe it's even going to start to clot

99
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:26,101
up over a long enough period of time.
What ceremonial magic tries to do is

100
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,320
invoke certain energies into your
system.

101
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,060
Now,
if you were to take that cup of water

102
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:33,460
that's stagnant,
Cup of water and just hold it under a

103
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:37,390
running faucet and just let it run until
it spills over the ram and hold it there

104
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:39,340
and just let it spill and spill and
spill.

105
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:41,200
Eventually what's gonna happen is all
that debris,

106
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:43,090
all that stagnation is going to be
washed out.

107
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,940
The same thing happens to us on an
energetic level.

108
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:47,740
One,
we're constantly invoking all these

109
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,740
energies.
The reason they're at planetary

110
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:52,210
astrological,
elemental,

111
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,500
they're still all variations of a type
of energy that we have a name for an

112
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,870
every single culture in the world except
ours.

113
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:00,561
You know,
for example,

114
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,870
the Chinese call it CCI,
the Japanese call it key,

115
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:05,510
the Hebrews call it rock,
the Indians call it Prada.

116
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,300
In the West,
we're the only ones who don't really

117
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,150
have a name for it.
So that's Kinda why I prefer just the

118
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:14,000
generic term of energy.
The thing I always tell people about

119
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:18,200
magic is you're already doing it.
You just don't realize it yet and you're

120
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:21,290
usually doing it to your own detriment.
You know,

121
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,480
for example,
whenever we're thinking of health,

122
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,950
we don't usually hold a picture in our
heads of ourselves as being vibrant and

123
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:30,680
healthy and whole.
Instead we're thinking things like,

124
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,630
oh,
I hope I don't get the flu this year.

125
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,720
The neighbors got it.
Everybody in the neighborhood's got it.

126
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,910
So I'm probably gonna come down with it
too.

127
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,000
Every time I get it,
I usually get it twice as bad as

128
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,740
everyone else.
It lasts twice as long.

129
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:46,100
So when we're doing that,
what we're actually doing is holding a

130
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:49,520
visualization of ourselves as being sick
in our heads.

131
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,560
You know,
we're putting energy into that.

132
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,350
There's a phrase now,
and I can't remember who came up with

133
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:55,940
it,
but they say where attention goes,

134
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:59,120
energy flows,
whatever you're focusing on,

135
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:04,150
you are giving energy to.
So a lot of magic is about training

136
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,880
yourself to focus on what you want
instead of what you don't want.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,540
And that's what we call thought forms.
The more you can focus on what it is

138
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,700
you're wanting,
the more energy you're putting onto it,

139
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,850
which means the more powerful thought
form you're creating.

140
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,950
You know,
when it comes to resiliency,

141
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:23,951
I think the thing that saved my life in
there was I found what I was supposed to

142
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:28,040
be doing in life.
As crazy as it sounds,

143
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,880
there were entire weeks would go by when
I didn't even think about the fact that

144
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:35,180
I was in prison because I was so focused
on magic.

145
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,980
You know,
people even now,

146
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:39,590
people will come up to me.
People who have been through horrible

147
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:42,560
things,
people who suffer from depression of

148
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:45,530
some sort and they say,
you know what got you through that,

149
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,210
what would bring you through these
things?

150
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,430
And the honest answer is there are only
two causes of depression.

151
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,150
One is a chemical imbalance,
in which case the only thing that's

152
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:59,330
going to correct it is medication,
something of that nature to correct a

153
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:03,560
physical problem,
the other cause in one way or another is

154
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:08,120
you're not doing what in magic we call
your will in Buddhism,

155
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:11,210
they call it Dharma.
It's the thing that you're put here to

156
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:13,490
do.
Nature.

157
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,350
The Universe is not going to waste a lot
of energy making duplicate people,

158
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:22,430
making cookie cutter people.
We're all here for a specific purpose

159
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,920
and your purpose may be similar to
someone else's,

160
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,310
but it's not gonna be exactly the same
because like I said,

161
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,230
the universe isn't going to waste that
energy.

162
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,340
The cause of happiness and the cause of
depression is figuring out what you're

163
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:43,970
supposed to be doing in this life and
then dedicating yourself to it 100

164
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:47,360
percent to the best of your ability.
From me,

165
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,390
that was doing magic when I started to
devote every minute of every day to

166
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:54,830
doing magic while I was in prison.
By the time I got out,

167
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:58,170
I was doing it under eight hours a day.
Once I started to do that,

168
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,780
everything else took a backseat.
You know,

169
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:03,090
I,
I still went through horrendous things,

170
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,360
you know,
like beatings or starvation or whatever

171
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:07,820
it was,
but you know,

172
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,180
once it's done I get right back up and I
go to doing magic because it was what I

173
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,590
loved.
It was,

174
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,230
you know,
when I started to figure out what was

175
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:19,920
possible because of this and how it was
affecting me on a mental level,

176
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:22,590
on an emotional level,
on a physical level,

177
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,840
I was so excited about it that
everything else just faded into the

178
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:31,020
background and I was happy even in
prison,

179
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,370
even on death row for huge chunks of
time,

180
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,080
I was happy because I was doing what I
was supposed to be doing in the world.

181
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,790
And still to this day,
you know,

182
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,410
the example I always give to people is
Michelangelo.

183
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,410
Whenever they asked him,
how do you create these sculptures,

184
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,670
he said,
well,

185
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:54,990
I just look at the block of marble and I
carved away anything that's not part of

186
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:57,720
the figure.
That's where happiness comes from.

187
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,490
You look at your life and you start
carving away anything that's not

188
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,270
pertinent to your life's mission.
So for me,

189
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,860
for example,
I don't go to parties.

190
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,350
I don't go to clubs,
I don't go to concerts.

191
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,690
I don't Chit Chat.
For me,

192
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,350
anything that is not directly connected
to magic,

193
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,610
I have gradually carved away from my
life and it has made me a much,

194
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:25,090
much happier person.
Social media.

195
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:29,200
I honestly now I try to stay away from
it as much as I possibly can.

196
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:34,710
I think it can be useful for really down
to earth practical things like letting

197
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,150
people know,
you know,

198
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,540
for example,
I'll use it to let people know where I'm

199
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,450
going to be doing a meditation class,
things of that nature.

200
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,280
But at the same time I think it is
incredibly detrimental as far as what

201
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,530
we're putting our energy into.
You know,

202
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:55,460
part of what magic is,
is containing our energy containing are

203
00:10:55,461 --> 00:11:00,190
cheap because we disperse it constantly.
We disperse it in everything we think

204
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:03,820
about everything we talk about and you
know,

205
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,020
I,
I saw a study come out about a week or

206
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,160
so ago where scientists were pretty much
saying we are now practically one

207
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:16,090
generation away from the extinction of
humanity due to climate change,

208
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:17,740
global warming,
all this sort of stuff.

209
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Yet the only thing that people were
talking about on social media was Kanye

210
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:28,321
west at the White House.
So it really can be detrimental to our

211
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:32,830
development if you let you know the
meaningless things or if you just spend

212
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,530
hours and hours a day combing through,
you know,

213
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:39,460
instagram photos of people taking
selfies,

214
00:11:39,461 --> 00:11:42,880
things of that.
I think you really have to be careful

215
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,810
with everything you consume and not just
in a physical way,

216
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:51,160
but mentally and emotionally as well as
well as everything that you put out.

217
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,640
I always try to be as mindful as I
possibly can about,

218
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,190
you know,
whatever I take in through the Internet

219
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,930
and whatever I put out through the
Internet.
