1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,800
BMI stands for business model
innovation.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,220
Innovation is often thought to be doing
something new,

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,850
but mostly doing something new.
By developing a new technology,

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,660
finding a new market or,
or designing a product to better match

5
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:16,930
consumer needs.
Business model innovation is a different

6
00:00:16,931 --> 00:00:19,960
kind of innovation.
This is where you produce basically the

7
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:22,660
same product address,
the same market needs.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,430
But the way in which you provision this
product to the market involves a new

9
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:29,980
business model.
This could be a new revenue model,

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,210
this could be a new cost model or most
interestingly it could be in different

11
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:37,500
risk model.
All of these models might help you

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,220
disrupt incumbents,
change the way things are done in an,

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,360
in an industry and provide a superior
product,

14
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:46,900
superior services and,
and disrupt the game in the industry.

15
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,460
So first off,
I think,

16
00:00:48,461 --> 00:00:49,300
um,
uh,

17
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,720
BMI as an approach,
uh,

18
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,910
is not,
not only about mitigating risk,

19
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,010
it is more about managing risk.

20
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,210
So we often think risk is a bad thing.
We got to a risk is going to hurt our

21
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:02,001
business.
Risk is,

22
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:03,370
is,
is always a bad thing.

23
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,870
Turns out companies that can better
manage risk companies that can

24
00:01:07,871 --> 00:01:12,070
differentiate themselves from the
incumbents in how their business model

25
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:15,790
deals with the risk might have a
significant advantage over the

26
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,010
incumbents over the folks who don't do
that.

27
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,770
So we can think of,
um,

28
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,390
in the,
in the transportation industry,

29
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,410
a company like Uber,
which is this transportation network

30
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:28,510
provider company,
the taxi hailing app,

31
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:31,120
some [inaudible],
some of you might know a,

32
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,200
compare that to a traditional taxi
service provider or a black car,

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,070
a service provider.
Now Black car service provider has,

34
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,380
has a much more risk in its business
model because it has to invest in,

35
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:45,910
in,
in a heavy asset load before any,

36
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:48,010
any demand shows up come through.

37
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,460
Like Uber on the other hand has a
business model which has a lot,

38
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:55,900
lot lower risks because it's the cost
and revenue scale up together.

39
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,220
If a lot of people want born taxi rides,
Uber ends up,

40
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,650
uh,
bringing in a lot of drivers on board.

41
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,220
If nobody wants a taxi ride,
there are no traffic drivers who are

42
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:09,010
paid.
And that that business model manages the

43
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:13,690
demand risk in a lot superior fashion
than a traditional taxi model does.

44
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,790
And that allows it to differentiate
itself from the traditional model and,

45
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,200
and provide a superior service to
consumers,

46
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,740
basically a service which allows them to
almost guarantee,

47
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,320
um,
a car within a few minutes,

48
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,290
irrespective of where,
where they are or irrespective of the

49
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,600
time of the day.
So that's,

50
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,170
that's using risk to differentiate
yourself not only as something you have

51
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,110
we have to worry about or tried to
mitigate.

52
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:39,960
Okay.
