1
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,870
We have a band called racket,
which,

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,793
uh,

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,960
it's a rock and roll band and it was set
up by myself and a fellow called Nigel

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,680
Smith who's a scholar of English
literature in particular a marvel and

5
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,970
Milton.
He does some work and him used to teach

6
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:32,340
at Oxford.
I met him in Oxford actually when I was

7
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:37,341
a professor poetry at Oxford and he was
the head of the English department at

8
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:41,440
Oxford United Teachers at Princeton.
So He's,

9
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,020
he's a very,
very

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,450
serious scholar,
but behind it all he's a rocker.

11
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,740
And um,
so he and I got together and we started.

12
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:56,640
I have always been interested in trying
to write songs I just

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,230
would love to be able to do it was quite
a difficult thing to do also.

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,280
But anyway,
we got together and we set up with a

15
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,120
band,
been a couple of versions of it,

16
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:14,121
but the present version of a great
guitarist and lead singer called Matthew

17
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,550
as a music scholar.
Um,

18
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,500
and then,
uh,

19
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,373
we have,
uh,

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,990
Steven Alan who's an entertainment
lawyer,

21
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:29,010
but a trained musician,
one of the Berkeley College of music.

22
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,850
And then our drummer,
Bobby Lewis as a also studied music at,

23
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,880
uh,
the College of New Jersey,

24
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:41,950
Trenton.
So they're all,

25
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,070
they're all quite wonderful musicians.
But this bit's rock'n'roll.

26
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,940
So rock and roll with the way.
Hope you know,

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,100
Demi,
Sammy,

28
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,370
Tammy semi.
Interesting.

29
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,480
Merrick's we're hoping.
We're hoping that's the idea.

30
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,400
So that combination and uh,
you know,

31
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,050
we keep plugging away at it.
And a

32
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,370
no,
we do it for fun to a large extent,

33
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:12,371
but we also were somewhat areas,
not in the sense that we're expected who

34
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,940
playing Madison Square Garden any day
soon though.

35
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,880
Mind you if there's anyone from Madison
Square Garden listening,

36
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:21,020
you know,
you should think about is um,

37
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,810
and um,
you know,

38
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:25,860
we have to be realistic about that.
Uh,

39
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,930
I,
I suppose that a fixed but 56 year old

40
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,990
like myself shouldn't be cherishing even
the remotest notion of that.

41
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:38,860
But then I think Mick Jagger,
Mick Jagger's in slightly better shape

42
00:02:38,861 --> 00:02:41,920
than I am as A.
Anyway,

43
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,190
I'm back to the treadmill.
I write the lyrics.

44
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,030
That's my main role.
I write the lyrics and I play the odd

45
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,500
some sometimes ms dot calculated chord
on a guitar,

46
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,980
but you know,
I do so with Breo or certainly the

47
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:04,411
attempt,
the attempt a of a Breo.

48
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,660
I love it.
I mean it's just,

49
00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:09,100
it's so much fun.
It's so much fun.

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,800
And the band actually is great.
I mean it's,

51
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,130
it's,
it's the standard one side.

52
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,320
We're praising myself,
but I'd said they're quite brilliant

53
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:18,750
really.
