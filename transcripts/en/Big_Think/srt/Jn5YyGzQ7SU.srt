1
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,120
Our drug policy has really been
traditionally based on racism and

2
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:13,810
moralizing.
The reason that they currently illegal

3
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:17,230
drugs are illegal,
has nothing to do with the scientific

4
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:20,200
evaluation of the relative risks and
benefits.

5
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:22,660
Otherwise,
you could never come up with a situation

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,260
where marijuana is illegal and tobacco
is legal.

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,540
You cannot make a rational argument for
that.

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,450
That comes from racism.
Um,

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,400
and the,
and colonialism,

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,970
the drug laws were made in explicitly
racist circumstances for explicitly

11
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:41,860
racist reasons.
For example,

12
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:46,000
the first anti cocaine laws were made
because cocaine supposedly made black

13
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:50,320
men impervious to bullets and prone to
getting involved with white women.

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,340
This is complete nonsense where there is
no science to it whatsoever.

15
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:57,400
And yet it was published in the New York
Times in the early 19 hundreds.

16
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,850
So this is where our laws come from and
we have to be honest about that and we

17
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:07,510
have to stop pretending that there is
some kind of rational basis for the laws

18
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:08,470
that we currently have.

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,420
Then what we need to do is realize that
you can't make policy based on,

20
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,090
I think it's bad for you to have honor
and pleasure.

21
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,750
You have to make policy based on does
this hurt you,

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,260
does this hurt other people?
And the,

23
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,650
that's where harm reduction comes from.
The basic idea of harm reduction is what

24
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:30,250
policy will most reduce the harm related
to drugs.

25
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,500
And once you start to focus on harm,
you have to look not only at harm

26
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:39,610
associated with drugs,
but harm associated with drug policy.

27
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:45,060
And this is why so many harm reduction
people rapidly become legalizers because

28
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,820
the harm associated with drug
prohibition has not produced the results

29
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,120
that people would like.
It does not stop addiction.

30
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,070
It does not,
um,

31
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,560
you know,
prevent kids from using drugs.

32
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,750
It makes the kids who use drugs be at
higher risk of dying from them on.

33
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,040
It doesn't,
you know,

34
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:10,870
Saves Society's productivity by like
keeping people from taking substances

35
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:15,490
that will make them not work on.
It just doesn't work.

36
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,880
And when you think about it,
if addiction is defined as compulsive

37
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:25,840
behavior despite negative consequences
and you're trying to use negative

38
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:30,580
consequences in order to stop it,
something is seriously wrong there.

39
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,850
So our drug policy has to acknowledge
the reality that punishment doesn't fix

40
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:39,310
addiction.
And that putting drug users in cages

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,450
does nothing but worse than the problem
and it doesn't deter kids.

42
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,460
Um,
at least idea that like,

43
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,530
oh,
if we just really stigmatize this and

44
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:50,620
make everybody hate drug users,
then kids will never use drugs.

45
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,470
Kids are going to do stupid,
risky things.

46
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,610
You want to reduce the chances that
those things will kill them.

47
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,530
The idea that can prevent adolescents
from having sex or prevent adolescents

48
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:06,760
from doing some kind of risky behavior
is just absurd.

49
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,593
This,
you know,

50
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,710
comes out before humans even evolved.
Again,

51
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:16,711
this is where it comes back to racism.
Our image of the typical drug user or

52
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:21,811
the typical drug addict is basically the
same as our racist stereotype of

53
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,340
whichever groups we happen to be
targeting.

54
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,740
So criminal,
lying,

55
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,480
manipulative,
deceitful,

56
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,850
Ahm,
you know,

57
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,890
all of these things that we project onto
other people and then stigmatize and

58
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:37,780
attack them for,
um,

59
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,070
we do the same with drug users.
Obviously if you make a behavior that

60
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:44,530
someone feels is essential to their
survival,

61
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:47,680
illegal,
they are going to lie to protect that

62
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:49,560
behavior.
That doesn't mean that they're

63
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:54,570
fundamentally a dishonest person.
The reason that we continue to have

64
00:03:55,361 --> 00:04:00,361
these stereotypes about who drug users
are is because of the ongoing racism of

65
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:06,571
our society.
And until we acknowledge that like I am

66
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,210
the typical drug user,
if there is such a thing,

67
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,740
um,
you know,

68
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,950
I don't look like your stereotype,
but that doesn't mean that the

69
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:16,330
stereotype is accurate.

70
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,140
Um,
so I think that's a really important

71
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:24,070
thing that people really have to learn
because for too long the media has

72
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:29,071
enabled the racist view of addiction and
has enabled people to,

73
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,720
um,
sort of say,

74
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,280
oh,
I'm not the typical addict.

75
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,151
Like,
you know,

76
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:37,120
and I used to say that and then I
realize,

77
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:38,710
wow,
that's like kind of racist,

78
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,100
you know,
and you know,

79
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,820
it comes from images that we shouldn't
have ever had.

80
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,040
So I think that the way to,
you know,

81
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,740
get beyond that.
And the way to help people with

82
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:58,660
addiction is to understand that people
with addiction are not seeking extra

83
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:01,630
pleasure.
They are not hedonist who are just out

84
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:05,260
there having so much fun using that.
You can't stop them unless you put them

85
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:07,540
in jail.
People who get addicted,

86
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:11,740
which are only 10 to 20% of the people
who use drugs like cocaine and heroin

87
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:12,970
and prescription opioids.

88
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,710
Those people have problems.
The drug seemed like a solution to them

89
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,160
until we recognize that those people are
seeking reasonably rationally to deal

90
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:25,750
with emotional and psychological
problems.

91
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,700
Um,
and sometimes economic problems.

92
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,990
We are not going to solve this problem.
And one of the things that I think we're

93
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:36,991
actually in denial about with regard to
the opioid epidemic is that while big

94
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:40,090
Pharma certainly didn't do anything good
here,

95
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,840
what they to say that this is caused by
purdue Pharma selling off the cotton is

96
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:51,871
to miss the fact that the people who are
overwhelmingly becoming addicted are

97
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:56,470
people who are either falling out of the
middle class or,

98
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,030
um,
never managed to get into it.

99
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,600
If you actually look at the economics of
this problem,

100
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,870
it's not that middle class.
People certainly don't get addicted and

101
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:07,730
it's not that rich people don't get
addicted.

102
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,890
It's just that if your life is despair
and you feel like it will never get any

103
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:15,470
better,
which is often the case when you lose

104
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:18,590
the American dream,
where you lose the hope for your future,

105
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,050
opioids are going to become very
attractive.

106
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,420
And the idea that we can solve this by
taking away the supply is just

107
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:27,500
ridiculous.
I mean,

108
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,100
as soon as we started cracking down on
the pill mills,

109
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,260
we started seeing a rise in heroin use.
This is not an unpredictable outcome

110
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,950
since we supposedly believe that
addiction is a disease.

111
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,360
Why would we think that simply cutting
off the supply from some patients like

112
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:46,280
turning over,
like making a thousand people,

113
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,530
we take this doctor out,
there's a thousand people and

114
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:50,930
withdrawal.
Now we don't provide any help for them

115
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,920
on why are we thinking this is going to
fix this problem and why are we thinking

116
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:58,910
that an illicit market is not going to
immediately grow up to satisfy that

117
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:00,290
demand?
Um,

118
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,480
the people who,
you know,

119
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,730
um,
the other thing that's important

120
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,020
economically is that in this is that
drug dealing is a way to make a living.

121
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,390
And if you have desperate,
unhappy people without jobs,

122
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,900
some of whom want to self medicate and
some of whom we just like to actually

123
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:19,000
get some money.
Um,

124
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,030
you are going to have a drug selling
problem and you are not going to solve

125
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:25,220
that problem by putting people in jail.

126
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,370
Mm.
