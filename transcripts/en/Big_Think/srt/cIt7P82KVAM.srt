1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,490
Uh,
I will leave it to their choice.

2
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:13,780
I'm gonna say,
what is your objective in world,

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,070
uh,
in life?

4
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:16,660
What do you want to do?
Eh,

5
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:18,970
you want to make money,
enjoy yourself,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,600
have all the things that,
uh,

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,780
uh,
needed for your enjoyment,

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,020
house,
cars,

9
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:27,640
a yacht or whatever.
Um,

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,880
this is one way.
This is your success or you want to

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,170
contribute.
You want to have a meaningful

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,050
interaction with the rest of the world
that,

13
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:39,420
uh,
they feel that a,

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:44,380
you are being useful to the planet and
are useful to your fellow human being.

15
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,830
So if you want to make a mark on this
planet,

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:53,340
if you want to be admired,
if you want to be respected for what you

17
00:00:53,891 --> 00:00:57,070
have done,
what your cap capability or creativity

18
00:00:57,071 --> 00:01:01,780
or intelligence has brought to this
world reduces some of the problems or

19
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:04,180
even remove some of the problems,
uh,

20
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,780
then social business will be one way
that you can adjust that.

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,890
Uh,
all you want to be a big rich person who

22
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:16,891
want to be on the top list of richest
man in the world or richest woman in the

23
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:19,540
world.
That's your choice.

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,950
But these are the two choices you have
to make a whatever way you want to go

25
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:26,500
about it.
These are the options you have.

26
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,080
You can mix both of them.
If you're successful,

27
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:32,170
you can make money the same time,
uh,

28
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,280
contribute to the world by using that
money in social justice.
