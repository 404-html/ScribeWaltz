1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:03,893
Let's just assume we're out in the 
streets and I become aware with this 

2
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:09,300
suspect has committed a crime of 
shoplifting,

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,210
not the worst crime in the world,
but the shopkeeper says,

4
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:13,044
Hey,
that guy just salt stole 10 bags to 

5
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:18,060
sequent the odor it and I can smell the 
guy from a distance.

6
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:19,710
And though,
and now I know why he needs the secret,

7
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:21,060
the old one,
but even paid for it,

8
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:21,894
right?
So now I'm basically doing my psychic 

9
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:26,970
interpretation of them and I realize 
he's a real nebbish.

10
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:27,804
She's a real schlub.
He's like not going to physically 

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,130
resist,
probably does yoga.

12
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:34,050
You know,
he's probably very new agey.

13
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:36,690
He probably balances crystals and 
watches Oprah.

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,830
So I know I got this guy in control,
I'm the sadist,

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,673
he's Damascus.
He probably wants me to put a ball gag 

16
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:45,360
in his mouth and whip him,
but it's not that kind of submission.

17
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,343
So what I do is I refer to the ancient 
code of Magna Carta and as if I was to 

18
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:51,150
show up,
I'm loving him.

19
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,300
I say you,
I suspect who has committed a crime,

20
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:55,134
you are in violation of the penal code.
So therefore I want you to wait for the 

21
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:03,600
police for five o copper squat.
Sit down and sit down now.

22
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,040
So he understands I'm in charge and he 
likes to be submissive.

23
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:08,874
Maybe he's getting his jollies off while
his weight problem is I'm calling nine 

24
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:13,350
one one and the cops,
uh,

25
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,223
Bustin donuts,
right that pound in donuts waiting for 

26
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:16,944
the fresh buttermilk toys to come out of
the Dunkin donuts of it will be waiting 

27
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:23,220
a month of Sundays.
But he's enjoying being submissive.

28
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:24,540
So Hey,
no pain,

29
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:25,620
no strain.
Right?

30
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,123
Can I have reason to believe I've seen 
or it's been brought to my attention 

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,193
that this Cretin with chromosome damage 
has snatched the chain off somebody's 

32
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,093
neck and it's not a little monster.
Cause I could tell he hasn't been to a 

33
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:41,950
lady.
God got conscious.

34
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,480
He's not weaken soft in that regard,
but he's ready to put up a fight.

35
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,220
I could tell there's a certain 
intensity.

36
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:50,310
Once again,
I'm using my psychic parameters now in a

37
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,230
general self defense costs.
They would say,

38
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,520
look for his solar plexus.
I can't even find his girdle.

39
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:57,660
Nevermind.
He's Goin to.

40
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,700
So I'm not even looking for a solar 
plexus.

41
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,361
They say,
Oh,

42
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:03,000
you want to hit a boom,
right in his Adam's apple,

43
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,380
it drive his Adam's apple or the bridge 
of his nose and he'll know not to go.

44
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,440
You think that will be wrassling around 
bridge of the nose?

45
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,180
Adam's apple as if I'm studying biology 
to prepare to become doctor md.

46
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,043
No.
What I do is it's for myself or if they 

47
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,504
are a number of others.
The weakest point of any person is any 

48
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,300
cabs I gotta make his kneecap sing and 
ring and in fact his instep,

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,910
which just walden,
five pounds of questioning,

50
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,093
Bam.
It's guy who's going to be doing a 

51
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,990
hopalong cassidy and then as he's 
pulling the hopalong cassidy,

52
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,560
I'm going to take his head right like 
this.

53
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,623
Bam,
like down on to which knee that will be 

54
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:44,430
goes.
He will be in the primal fetal position.

55
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,264
I really won't have to do much if I have
a pair of handcuffs on or if I have a 

56
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:48,414
belt that just tie them up to a 
stationary object can wait for the 

57
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:51,631
police.
Right now.

58
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:52,464
My problem is if this massive swelling 
and I can't find this steak or a piece 

59
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,893
and to put the swelling down,
I could end up going to jail myself 

60
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,930
because I don't know,
right to go over the top.

61
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,020
Use excessive physical force.
Even though he is committed a crime.

62
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,200
I have no special powers and privileges.
I am not a police officer,

63
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,750
so I have to make sure that whatever for
I use,

64
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:13,690
particularly in this fact that he's just
snatched the chain.

65
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:17,380
He hasn't threatened to anybody's life 
that if I'm violating him physically,

66
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,290
he may go to jail,
get charged for change snatching.

67
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,303
But I may be charged with assault and 
battery cause a copper may turn around 

68
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:25,590
after munching on the doughnuts and say 
it,

69
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:27,190
you know,
you have the right to Keller charge,

70
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:29,860
have him arrested.
And then once he hooks up with a lawyer,

71
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,110
a b lawyer that they assigned in court,
he goes,

72
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:32,891
hey,
do you ever think of,

73
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:35,770
so in the Guardian Angels,
I could get a third of the action.

74
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:37,630
No,
retain his sign on the dotted line.

75
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,390
So you've gotta be very cautious under 
column b,

76
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,590
Rules and regulations.

77
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,600
Now,
this guy,

78
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,760
enemy of society is intent on becoming a
modern day street warrior,

79
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:52,171
a.
K,

80
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:57,160
a shy,
he a k a suicide kamikaze maniac because

81
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:01,270
he knows he's going to j a I l and he 
wants to go out in a blaze of glory.

82
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,460
He could have a bat,
he could have a stick,

83
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,740
he could have a chain,
he could have a ship pool.

84
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,050
He wants to stick me right underneath 
the ribs,

85
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:10,840
which would cause me to bleed to death 
before I even hit the ground.

86
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,883
Or he might have a tool in a gun.
I've got to make an instantaneous 

87
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:19,150
decision to move towards the guy because
if I move away from the guy,

88
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:21,040
there's a good chance I'm going to get 
hit anyway.

89
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,190
And in the process of falling back,
I lose the aggressiveness.

90
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,230
He's on the attack,
him on the defensive.

91
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,510
Very difficult for me to get control of 
him.

92
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,553
So what I want to be able to do is get 
them into a position where I can spin 

93
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:32,710
them around and then

94
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,110
no,
by moving one way or the other one I met

95
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,950
at that point of Ireland had a guardian 
angel to the three.

96
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:47,780
We can take them down lickety split and 
then by myself I can rest more.

97
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:48,960
When they at the restaurant

98
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,080
now you see in the process of waking is 
back.

99
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,310
You might say,
oh,

100
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,060
dastardly how over the top how 
neanderthal of you,

101
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,690
but if this guy has a weapon and he's 
just committed a crime with a weapon,

102
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:06,524
guess what?
The judge is going to actually like an 

103
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:09,314
accordion giving me more leeway than 
they would a police officer who should 

104
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:13,574
know better,
who should be in control of his mental 

105
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:18,050
and physical faculties,
who should be able to immediately get on

106
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:18,884
his walkie talkie and some in other 
police officers to give them some 

107
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:23,630
backup.
If I'm on my own,

108
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,930
I have to use whatever force is 
necessary to protect myself,

109
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:27,764
to protect other victims,
to protect maybe in this instance even 

110
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:31,754
himself because if he has a weapon,
you may end up doing harm to himself if 

111
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:35,654
he misuses it.
I can't tell you how many times I've 

112
00:05:37,341 --> 00:05:40,950
shown up at a location where the guy 
who,

113
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:41,990
uh,
let's face it,

114
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,060
couldn't connect all the dots.

115
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,800
Even if you tried for a month of 
Sundays,

116
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:46,634
ended up shooting himself cause they 
keep the gun there in the belt and they 

117
00:05:50,691 --> 00:05:51,524
keep it write me at the their thigh and 
they ended up shooting themselves so 

118
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:57,170
many times because they already have it 
on the trigger.

119
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,650
It's already triggered the fire that 
round that's in the barrel of the gun.

120
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,693
They don't even have the safety on it.
So they ended up shooting themselves as 

121
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:06,710
they're trying to run away from you.
So you were actually doing him a solid,

122
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:07,544
even though temporarily he's going to 
have a lot of strain and pain and oohs 

123
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:12,590
and Aahs.
They'll worry about it.

124
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,813
He'll still live.
He's not going to be room temperature 

125
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,330
and you won't be sued.
Now,

126
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,490
this is not something you should be 
treated,

127
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,633
your own house.
Just something that you have to 

128
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:23,230
practice.
Practice,

129
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,064
practice,
like as if you were playing rock and 

130
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:28,240
off,
had a concerto on a baby.

131
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:29,890
Grand Piano.
Trust me,

132
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:31,480
I've done this many,
many times,

133
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:34,420
so I wouldn't suggest it as a sort of a 
new jacket.

134
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,390
First Time citizen arrest are out there 
a do gooder,

135
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:40,030
who all of a sudden wants to earn the 
Congressional Medal of honor.

136
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:40,864
Right.
