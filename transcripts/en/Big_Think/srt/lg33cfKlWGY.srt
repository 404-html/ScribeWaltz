00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,120
It's job to address her issues are
important to the lives of the American

2
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:14,990
people.
Um,

3
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,130
I don't think that,
uh,

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,030
I think there's a line that is always
drawn between people's private lives and

5
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,090
public policy,
but many of us,

6
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:28,640
for example,
who support the rights of the unborn,

7
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:30,980
believe that that's a universal human
right.

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,660
And our advocacy for it extends beyond
the boundaries of the United States.
