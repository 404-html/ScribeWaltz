1
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,970
We need to save for our future,
the country's becoming prosperous,

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,330
need to share their prosperity with
their citizens and let them spend that.

3
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:17,780
China,
for example,

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:23,170
consumes less than 40 percent of its GNP
is hardly a is hardly appropriate.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,040
We need to find the fora that will
connect not a limited set of aging

6
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:36,590
societies dominated by the Atlantic
Ocean,

7
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,220
but a much wider set of rapidly emerging
societies to provide the function of

8
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:46,190
being a kind of global steering
committee.

9
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,730
As we address a central,
a global concerns,

10
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,030
we need to find ways in the United
States to support a more inclusive

11
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,140
democracy in a more inclusive
prosperity.

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,560
If our people are going to be willing to
accept the kind of international role

13
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:13,571
that the United States needs to take.
If the world is going to remain stable.

14
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:18,770
Some of that goes to healthcare.
Some of that goes to a that the tax

15
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:23,771
system and a much much else.
We need to forge some kind of

16
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:31,841
international approach to dealing with
what are really the existential threats

17
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,990
around nuclear weapons.
The nuclear proliferation around global

18
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:39,440
warming,
the two events that have the chance to

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,800
profoundly change the terms of life on
earth 50 or 100 years,

20
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,700
uh,
from a now.
