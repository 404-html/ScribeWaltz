1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,700
Political comedies just as easy now as
it was during the Bush years.

2
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,060
It still,
um,

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,380
it's a different cast of characters,
but,

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,270
you know,
they've got all the same foibles.

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,230
Uh,
uh,

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,640
personally,
uh,

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,930
you know,
speaking for myself,

8
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:24,120
I certainly like,
and,

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,760
and trust our president now more than I
did our previous one.

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:28,780
But,
uh,

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,370
he makes plenty of,
uh,

12
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,570
goofs,
uh,

13
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,730
I,
I certainly don't approve of everything

14
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:34,210
he does.
And,

15
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,030
and there's a cast of characters in
Washington right now that are,

16
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,960
uh,
you know,

17
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,580
absolutely.
As hilarious as,

18
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,890
as anyone who was there during the Bush
years,

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,500
we're always looking to keep it fresh
and,

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,000
and,
and,

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,170
and that's not so much because we need,
we're scared we're going to lose the

22
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:52,520
audience.
It's more,

23
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:54,720
we don't want to lose our own interests.
Uh,

24
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,141
you know,
you,

25
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:57,710
you do the show four days a week,
you know,

26
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,470
however many weeks a year,
you can get bored by doing it.

27
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,040
So we have to keep making it exciting
for ourselves.

28
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,880
So there's absolutely,
there's,

29
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,360
there,
there's that and it was like,

30
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,370
let's try something new,
even though it might be hard.

31
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,900
And there's also,
um,

32
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,090
you know,
we're,

33
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,110
we're,
it's a group of very competitive,

34
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:18,420
funny people and we'd like to make each
other laugh.

35
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,040
So,
you know,

36
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,093
we're,
we're,

37
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,600
we know what a standard show could be
and we're always trying to break out of

38
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:25,980
that just so we can impress each other.

39
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,620
Absolutely not.
No,

40
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,180
I,
uh,

41
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,990
the hardest part for me in a work
environment is collaboration.

42
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,560
Uh,
it's that,

43
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,550
that's just a struggle I've always had.
And I,

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,300
I,
I love my coworkers and I love,

45
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,040
uh,
you know,

46
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,860
bouncing ideas around with them.
But,

47
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:47,110
uh,
I really enjoy pure riding,

48
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:49,930
just sitting and writing by myself.
Um,

49
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,640
you know,
and every show is different.

50
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:53,710
This is,
this is the most collaborative

51
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:56,830
environment I've ever been in.
I used to ride on a TV show called news

52
00:01:56,831 --> 00:01:58,900
radio where,
uh,

53
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,130
it was very different.
We didn't have a,

54
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:02,830
uh,
uh,

55
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,040
any sort of big table or anything where,
where ideas are bounced around.

56
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,370
We Really,
uh,

57
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,550
you'd come up with a script idea and
you'd go off and write it.

58
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,680
You need to hand it to the next guy up
the food chain.

59
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:13,180
And he would rewrite it.
It was,

60
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,630
you know,
it was,

61
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,920
uh,
as pure writing experience as you can

62
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:19,300
get an insert of the TV world.

63
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,650
The main difference between the two is
just the immediacy there,

64
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:25,780
the daily show,
the news hits,

65
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,500
and we get,
we get to take care of it that night.

66
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,753
Uh,
the simpsons,

67
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,250
such a strange animal,
um,

68
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,350
and a wonderful animal,
but a strange one,

69
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:38,770
you would be writing for something that
wouldn't air for nine months to a year

70
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,480
and,
and it's still,

71
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:41,410
people would go,
wow,

72
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,760
how did you get that reference?
You know,

73
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:43,481
so quickly.
And,

74
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:44,710
and,
and uh,

75
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,300
you know,
frequently it would seem like,

76
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:47,440
uh,
uh,

77
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,190
the show was present.
Um,

78
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,090
I,
I enjoyed the simpsons,

79
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:52,691
but I tell you what,
I,

80
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:54,630
I like the immediacy of the daily show
more.

81
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,240
It,
it was free.

82
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,960
It's frustrating to write something and
then not see the finished product,

83
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,771
uh,
for,

84
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:00,610
uh,
a year,

85
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,350
uh,
with the daily show.

86
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,700
It's like you're really putting on a
show.

87
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,601
You know,
I'm,

88
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,580
I'm Mickey Rooney,
uh,

89
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,170
you know,
I'm writing a script and that night it

90
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:09,880
goes live.
And if it's terrible,

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,230
well,
we'll do another show tomorrow night.

92
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,930
Oh,
absolutely.

93
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,400
Yeah.
We're,

94
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,831
we're,
we're,

95
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:17,540
we're not so different from everybody
else.

96
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,970
It's not like I'm particularly funny in
this interview anyway,

97
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:21,350
so,
uh,

98
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,470
you know,
we don't always have to be funny.

99
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:25,820
How's that?
Um,

100
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,043
you,
um,

101
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,260
uh,
W I,

102
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,480
I think we can be just as adequate at
managing people as others and,

103
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:33,980
you know,
and it,

104
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,813
look,
it's,

105
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,840
it's all management skills that go into
our wheelhouse.

106
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,760
It's,
uh,

107
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,791
okay.
I,

108
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,550
I read a script.
This isn't funny.

109
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,020
This is what you need to do.
Boop,

110
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:42,630
boop,
boop,

111
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,670
uh,
it's,

112
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,620
if I were an accountant,
I'd be able to point out,

113
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,480
uh,
where the numbers didn't add up.

114
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,310
Um,
you know,

115
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:51,910
if I'm watching a montage and this
doesn't go together quite right,

116
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,910
I,
it as someone who is a professional is a

117
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:57,420
comedy professional.
Uh,

118
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,040
I,
I,

119
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,870
I can point out what's going to work
better.

120
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,670
No,
I tell you what,

121
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,560
it,
everyone at the show is so nice and,

122
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:06,031
and,
and,

123
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:09,310
and so shockingly competent that it,
it's,

124
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,260
uh,
it's not a real problem.

125
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,000
Uh,
I've been in situations where,

126
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,670
um,
there've been people who are difficult

127
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:16,600
to,
people who just didn't want to be

128
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:18,000
around,
uh,

129
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,390
people you had to manage more heavily.
I,

130
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,320
there's nothing like that there.
It's a,

131
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,730
and I think a lot of that has to do
with,

132
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,560
with,
with the fact that it's such a fast

133
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:28,720
moving machine.
Anyone who,

134
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,290
who acts as any sort of,
uh,

135
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,310
sand in the gears get spit out pretty
quickly.

136
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:37,950
Okay.
