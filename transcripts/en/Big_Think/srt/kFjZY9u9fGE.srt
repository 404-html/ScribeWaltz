1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,900
I do think that behavior has improved,
uh,

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,630
at least on the margin,
if not more.

3
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:11,610
So we haven't seen,
you know,

4
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,890
it's funny for all of the,
uh,

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,500
financial destruction in the markets
that have taken place.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,220
You know,
this,

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,500
this has been a period where we had not
seen people,

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,310
uh,
get,

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,080
uh,
get taken away in handcuffs,

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,820
uh,
whether it be on Wall Street or

11
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:24,790
elsewhere.
You know,

12
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,110
occasionally you hear about an insider
trading ring or you know,

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,240
a one off,
usually some mom and pop in

14
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:32,160
Czechoslovakia that seemed to get,
you know,

15
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,300
taken out,
taken away,

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,930
but you haven't heard of a,
of big time CEO's and a lot of trouble.

17
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,820
And,
and I do think that one of the,

18
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,570
one of the things that was going on
during the Enron period and why

19
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:45,480
prosecutors were as harsh as they were,
and I know a lot of people thought they

20
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:47,170
were too harsh,
um,

21
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,770
was that they were really thinking about
the deterrence factor.

22
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:52,860
And at least so far now we talked about
short memories on Wall Street,

23
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,060
at least so far it's working.
Um,

24
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,480
as I said before,
everything comes in cycles.

25
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,400
And I can't imagine we won't do this all
again anyway.
