1
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,710
Religiously.
I want to believe people are

2
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:16,010
fundamentally good.
Um,

3
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,090
yeah,
I think people are a,

4
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:22,090
I think people are fundamentally good.
And B,

5
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:23,890
I think people are fundamentally,
um,

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,300
humorous and people fundamentally want
to laugh.

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,020
And you know,
if someone is not laughing,

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,320
that's the exception.
That's perversion because I think you

9
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:37,840
can be turned from someone who likes to
laugh to someone who doesn't.

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,540
But I think it's almost impossible to go
the other way.

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,430
I don't think no one's ever met a
humorless person who became a funny one.

12
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:48,800
Yeah.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,560
Now
you can learn the form and whatever,

14
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,830
and maybe you could even learn the form
so well that you can fool most people.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,930
We wouldn't be able to fool the
genuinely funny people,

16
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,090
boredom.
And I think also just the,

17
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,640
uh,
there's such an intense psychic pain

18
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:20,790
just being alive and all this stuff
going down on,

19
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:23,250
around you and on top of you and it's
suffocating.

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,800
You know,
humor is released.

21
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,663
It,
it's,

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,200
it is joyful.
You know,

23
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,890
it's like sex,
but you can have it more often.

24
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,970
Um,
it,

25
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,700
yeah,
it's like cheap sex.

26
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:39,570
It's like,
it's,

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,920
you can do it all the time,
so,

28
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:42,943
okay.

29
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,700
You know,
I don't know that it's sort of a cliche.

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,660
They have a funny rabbi,
you know,

31
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,060
every rabbi thinks he's pretty
hilarious.

32
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,120
Um,
or at least they do nowadays.

33
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:56,610
And the old days,
I think they thought they were pretty

34
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:58,230
serious.
Uh,

35
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,330
you know,
I don't know,

36
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,010
I could wax philosophical and say,
well,

37
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:03,510
there's,
you know,

38
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,800
comedy and religion or about some sort
of aspiration or something higher or do

39
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:08,640
you know,
to elevate us?

40
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:09,960
And when we laugh,
you know,

41
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:13,650
our souls become bigger.
But I don't think so.

42
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,240
Um,
I think,

43
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,900
I think rabbis are smart people and I
think smart people tend to be funny.

44
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:25,110
So maybe that's the connection,
by the way.

45
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,730
I should have been drinking coffee,
but,

46
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,680
uh,
I don't if there's any connection

47
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:33,840
whatsoever.
Um,

48
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,910
you know,
I think there must be some connection

49
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:38,910
between religion and comedy because a
while,

50
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,520
because the people I know in comedy are
either pretty religious or,

51
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,960
and that's the minority,
or is there a swing the other way

52
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,620
completely and are rabidly atheistic.
So,

53
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,810
uh,
maybe,

54
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:57,660
um,
there's some emotional switch that gets

55
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:58,530
clicked on either way.

56
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,310
That's a good question.
Uh,

57
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,910
comedy,
it's a lot more self aware than they

58
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:09,010
used to be.
The audience as a lot more self aware

59
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,873
of,
uh,

60
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,650
you know,
uh,

61
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,070
we're not,
you're not just making jokes necessarily

62
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:17,680
anymore.
You're making jokes on jokes and your

63
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:20,290
jokes have reference to other jokes.
And,

64
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,830
uh,
it might have been in the old days,

65
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:24,610
the only other people in the comedy
business would know these things.

66
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:29,611
But now everyone's,
we've got such a vast cultural,

67
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,790
uh,
backlog on DVD and everything that

68
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,080
everyone knows,
every Monte Python sketch and everyone

69
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,760
knows this and that,
that,

70
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:38,080
that,
that we're all kind of,

71
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,170
we and the audience are making
references to,

72
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,630
uh,
and,

73
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,980
and,
and winking at them from things that are

74
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:46,670
40 years old.
And that said,

75
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:48,310
I,
and comedy probably,

76
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,290
it hasn't changed as much as we think it
has either.

77
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,060
You know what I mean?
That,

78
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,821
that,
that can say,

79
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:53,920
okay,
well we all have that reference point,

80
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:57,220
but it's probably an a in a small way,
not that big a deal.

81
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:58,090
And,
and,

82
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,953
um,

83
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,710
okay.

84
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,860
Wow.
That's a good question because I,

85
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,110
I would say we still laugh at slapstick
and,

86
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,310
but we don't as much,
you know,

87
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:12,470
and it would be very hard for,
um,

88
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,700
you know,
to get away with something as like,

89
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,360
it's primitive.
It was like an early sixties Jerry Lewis

90
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:21,500
movie right now.
You just,

91
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,930
you know,
even the kids aren't laughing at that

92
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,180
anymore.
You've got Mr. Bean like,

93
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:27,890
and that's nice and that's nice slap
stick and,

94
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,980
but it's somehow,
it seems more sophisticated,

95
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:31,680
but that,
that,

96
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,580
that I might just be,
because it's more modern style.

97
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,010
Uh,
it used to be,

98
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:39,350
you know,
if he lived in a village and didn't have

99
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:42,080
tv and a clown came through,
he said that it was the funniest God,

100
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,550
anything you'd ever seen in your life.
You know,

101
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:46,100
he'd be fell on this,
but amazing.

102
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,730
If you've got,
you know,

103
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,930
eight hours of TV every day and you can
see amazing,

104
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:54,200
you know,
you can see Marcel Marceau and you can

105
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:55,240
see,
uh,

106
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,750
Lenny Bruce,
he can see whatever,

107
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:57,584
whatever,
you know,

108
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,850
the exposure makes you more of a,
I'm a critic.

109
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,520
You know,
if you've only been peanut butter and

110
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:06,800
jelly sandwiches all your life,
you think those are pretty great.

111
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:08,630
But you know,
once you taste the caviar,

112
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,370
forget about peanut butter.

113
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't know if there's a,
there's an awful lot of it being

114
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:17,330
produced.
Um,

115
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,220
I think what we're doing now,
you know,

116
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,960
is an area where we're going to see a
lot of comedy produced just in smaller,

117
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,780
uh,
it just with the Internet,

118
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,660
uh,
for the power of giving the people just

119
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:32,740
to produce things.
I mean,

120
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,260
uh,
we're going to see things on youtube,

121
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,030
you know,
we're going to see if people have a

122
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:40,960
funny idea and shoot it on their dv
camera and get it out there that

123
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:42,910
afternoon.
Um,

124
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,853
okay.

125
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,020
But people are always also going to want
to see bigger,

126
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:49,440
you know,
more expensive things.

127
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,140
They're always gonna want to see
sitcoms,

128
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:56,141
I think,
or a big funny movies that you wanna see

129
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,640
something nice,
you know,

130
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,361
it's like,
okay,

131
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,370
Youtube,
that was a funny video that guy made,

132
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,850
you know?
But I want to,

133
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,590
I want a compelling story to,
you know,

134
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,670
people like stories.
We've,

135
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,920
we've always liked stories.
Uh,

136
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,890
so I,
I don't,

137
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:12,250
I don't think comedy is going to change
a,

138
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,160
okay.
Here.

139
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,280
I don't think the forum comedy takes,
there's going to be all that different

140
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,560
in the future.
Um,

141
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,511
now,
you know,

142
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,130
I don't know which way the world's going
to go,

143
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,230
but if,
you know,

144
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,860
the world gets darker than the comedy
will probably become darker,

145
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,980
more violent.
Um,

146
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,620
we might be seeing some of that now.

147
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,653
Okay.

148
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,690
No,
I don't,

149
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,320
I tend not to watch any comedy,
otherwise it would be my whole life.

150
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,900
And also,
you know,

151
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,760
like,
it's so critical.

152
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,760
It's impossible just to watch anything
and enjoy it,

153
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,260
you know?
So I,

154
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,560
I tend to keep away from it as much as
possible.

155
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,800
Okay.

156
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,320
I Dunno.
I,

157
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,010
I think it's changing it for,
it's changing it.

158
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,960
There's really no telling.
Yeah,

159
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:05,570
it's better.
It's nice to be able to have a DVD of

160
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:06,680
funny stuff and,
you know,

161
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,730
it's nice to be able to go on Youtube
and watch the funny guys.

162
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,490
Um,
but yeah,

163
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,980
I saw these 20 guys doing a David Blaine
impression the other day.

164
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:17,380
That was funny.
You know,

165
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,350
I got to watch that.
Now.

166
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:19,330
I don't have to see it anymore,
you know,

167
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,340
but it's out there that are Kelly
trapped in the closet.

168
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,860
Like that's all great stuff and it's
there.

169
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,960
And um,
so that's all for the good.

170
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,260
Um,
as you know,

171
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,260
it isn't strictly about computers,
but you know,

172
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:34,420
as,
as a visual agent,

173
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,270
no written comedy is nonexistent.
You know,

174
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,140
there's a couple of pages in the front
of the New Yorker and that's really it.

175
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,670
So that's kind of sad.
Um,

176
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,350
but you know,
there's plenty to read if you want to.

177
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,130
I can certainly make fun of my people.
Um,

178
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,800
and other Cantu,
I mean it's,

179
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,480
I feel like I'm a nine,
but I think as a Jew is sort of a

180
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:06,350
specific case because there are a lot of
Jewish writers and we tend to go to the

181
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:07,101
Jew,
well,

182
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:10,430
a lot in comedy and bounced that it's
really easy.

183
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:14,720
And I don't love that.
I think it's a little too easy.

184
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,870
Um,
you know,

185
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,870
ethnically at El,
I think you'll find a lot of copywriters

186
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,170
are Jewish and a lot her Irish.
Uh,

187
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,000
and I,
I'm not sure why those two streams sort

188
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:24,200
of came together,
but you know,

189
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:24,950
it's,
uh,

190
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,960
uh,
we tend to get along so it's nice.

191
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,440
Um,
can

192
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,600
I think some Jewish jokes are very funny
and I think others are,

193
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:36,600
you know,
are just at,

194
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,290
or just it,
just saying the word Jew and expecting a

195
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,101
laugh,
you know,

196
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:41,060
and,
and uh,

197
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:43,940
that's easy.
At first the other ethnicities go,

198
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,880
um,
I don't feel like anything should be out

199
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:47,900
of bounds,
you know,

200
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,773
I,
I just,

201
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,100
you know,
I'm stridently,

202
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:54,080
you know,
First Amendment,

203
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,120
struggling second amendment to have.
I like all those amendments,

204
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,190
you know,
and uh,

205
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,150
you know,
and then again,

206
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,890
that said,
if you say something offensive,

207
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:07,320
you know,
you can expect to get your ass kicked.

208
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,970
You know,
you should have the right to say it

209
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:09,804
though.

210
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,690
I think everyone self sensors,
I mean,

211
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,850
you think awful things,
you,

212
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,860
I'm sure you're thinking the awful
things right now,

213
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:20,390
but you know,
we all think terrible,

214
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:21,440
terrible,
terrible things.

215
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,520
Uh,
so sometimes the terrible things,

216
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:30,140
I think our jokes and uh,
so I don't always say this out loud.

217
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:35,141
I'm actually,
I probably self censor a lot less than a

218
00:09:35,571 --> 00:09:39,380
lot of people and I have certainly said
some terrible things,

219
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,320
which I regret,
but that's okay.

220
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,653
Yes.

221
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,010
I can't say I think about,
and again,

222
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,900
it's,
you know,

223
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,470
I would ask you,
uh,

224
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,370
or I'd ask anyone,
uh,

225
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,970
does it,
is it easier for them to self censor?

226
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:56,050
Sometimes you know,
you,

227
00:09:56,051 --> 00:09:56,360
you,
you,

228
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,620
you walk around saying,
I'm censoring myself right now.

229
00:09:59,621 --> 00:10:00,460
No,
but you know,

230
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,500
like,
uh,

231
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,000
you aren't telling every beautiful woman
how much you would like to have sex with

232
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:08,440
her reverie.
Attractive man.

233
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,233
The same thing.
If,

234
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,460
if you find both of them equally
attractive,

235
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,070
you know,
um,

236
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,600
it has,
it become easier to sell.

237
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,340
I don't know.
I guess when you were a kid,

238
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,630
you know,
you say anything you want.

239
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,490
Uh,
I'm an adult now.

240
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:22,900
I don't,
um,

241
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,950
I,
I would say it's not any different for a

242
00:10:26,951 --> 00:10:29,770
comedy writer or a writer in general
than it is for anyone else.

243
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,860
I think we are afforded more freedom.
I think I don't,

244
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,740
I don't think writers and Comedians
don't have to censor as much.

245
00:10:35,741 --> 00:10:37,210
I think,
you know,

246
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,550
we're given that latitude.
We don't want to use it that level.

247
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,300
We have it.

248
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:41,370
Okay.
