1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,400
Yeah,

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,240
Rita dove
title,

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,100
professor of English,
I guess

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,310
you know,
when I read

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,490
this sounds really weird,
but when I was about 10 or 11,

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,330
I stumbled across the Elliot at home.
My father had bought the great books of

7
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:35,120
the Western world and one of the first
books there was the elliot.

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,830
I had no idea what it was,
but it was a very long thing and I

9
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,870
thought this is the beginning of
literature,

10
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:46,871
so I'm going to read this and I
understood probably about half of it,

11
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,040
but it was fascinating.
It was an incredibly tense and

12
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,830
interesting story and once I got into
the whole

13
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,310
way that the poems worked,
it were like a,

14
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,450
like a swash buckling mystery in a way.
So that made me feel like,

15
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:06,680
gosh,
this is exciting.

16
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:07,670
I'd like to do that too.

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,240
The one that I remember,
I wrote posts before this,

18
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,900
but the one that I consider first real
poem was about that time too,

19
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:20,490
but it was an easter poem.
Um,

20
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,520
in school we were supposed to write,
write,

21
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,030
or paint or do something artistic for
Easter.

22
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,570
So I wrote this poem called the rabbit
with the droopy ear and I remember it

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,920
because when I began writing the poem I
had no idea how it was going to end.

24
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:41,390
I just had this idea of a rabbit,
the Easter bunny who had one ear that

25
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,120
you know,
droop down and he was distressed.

26
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,300
So I kept writing and it rhymed and all
that,

27
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,900
and it was actually the rhyme itself
that helped me solve the problem of a

28
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:55,220
rabbit with the droopy year.
So the end of the poem that goes hip,

29
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:55,851
hip,
hooray,

30
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:59,420
let's toast the cup for now.
Both ears were hanging up,

31
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,350
he hanged himself from a tree and his
ears hang straight and everybody's

32
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:04,970
cheering.
And I was just,

33
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,700
I don't know,
it was very exciting to find that.

34
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:10,880
Indeed.
I actually had to read it aloud in

35
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:11,880
class,
you know,

36
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,050
that was another thing.
Those were the days when you did these

37
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,140
things in class,
but now people showed their paintings if

38
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:21,670
they had something from eastern.
I had to read my poem aloud and,

39
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,890
and people liked it,
the kids liked it,

40
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:26,780
my friends.
So that was an instant success story.

41
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,500
It hasn't totally changed.
Um,

42
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,640
it,
it's changed in the sense that,

43
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,950
that,
uh,

44
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,090
to some extent I know let's say that the
goal is not to come to some kind of neat

45
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:47,310
solution as that did,
but,

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,400
um,
but it hasn't changed in the sense that

47
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,330
at some level I'm never quite sure how
the poem is going to resolve itself and

48
00:02:58,381 --> 00:03:02,980
that I'm always in some way surprise.
I make a discovery in a poem once I

49
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:07,981
write it a buy now that means more
accessing the subconscious and the fact

50
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:15,130
that if I begin writing a poem on that
means I'm intrigued in some way by

51
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:20,131
whatever it's about and that if I'm not
trying to find something new and pushing

52
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:26,620
that envelope in the poem,
I can't expect my reader to be

53
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,330
particularly excited about it either.

54
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,940
Um,
it's different every time.

55
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,730
And in fact,
years ago there was an,

56
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,490
I did do something like that,
uh,

57
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,540
for
a magazine.

58
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,600
Uh,
we're a,

59
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
we're a journalist actually followed me
around and we tried to.

60
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,570
But,
but I'm frightened different every time.

61
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,050
My inspiration comes from everywhere.
Uh,

62
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,270
just walking down the street just and I
never know where it's going to come

63
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:57,850
from,
so I keep a notebook with me at all

64
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:58,710
times.
Um,

65
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,870
and the only criteria for anything
making it into that notebook is if it

66
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:08,260
stops me in my tracks for even an
instant,

67
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,490
if it catches my eye or my ear,
you know.

68
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,170
And,
and I just write it down.

69
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,840
That means that there are recipes in
there,

70
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,780
you know,
there are words and sometimes there's a

71
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:22,120
character description or sometimes it's
aligned.

72
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,630
And after that point though,
what happens is kind of odd.

73
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,880
Um,
I tend to,

74
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,560
I work in fragments in the sense that
I'm not going to sit down and say,

75
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,650
first line is this,
and now I'm going to just write my way

76
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:40,420
through it.
I let the poem,

77
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,340
it's like piecing it together like a
pot.

78
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:46,390
So I might have a line that I might
write down on the middle of a page and I

79
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:49,540
still write things down with a pen on
paper.

80
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,820
I go to the computer when it gets too
messy and use it like an elaborate

81
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,430
typewriter because I've printed out.
And then I mess it up again,

82
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,020
but when I do get down,
sit down to write in my room with my

83
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:05,830
study and I try to write it a certain
time every night.

84
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,700
I'm a night person at best times or
midnight to six,

85
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:14,701
actually
I'll leave you my notebooks and if

86
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:19,380
something catches my eye and I feel like
I want to transfer it from the notebook

87
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,260
to the page I do.

88
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,630
And then comes this very strange
process,

89
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,280
which is difficult to describe and that,
uh,

90
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,800
right until I get stuck or I can't go
any further,

91
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:36,370
I'm boring myself or whatever.
And then I might go to another poem.

92
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,950
Uh,
I might go to another folder where there

93
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:42,340
are other drafts of poems and various
stages of completion.

94
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,360
And the only way I have for keeping
track of all this fragment tarry stuff

95
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,410
is by color.
And I have different colored folders,

96
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:54,370
red folders,
blue,

97
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,770
yellow.
So I might go into my study,

98
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,450
let's say one evening and say I feel
like the blue folder today

99
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,900
and I'll pick up the blue folder and see
what's in there.

100
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,340
So it's something that I've kind of
worked out over the years,

101
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:14,440
but the colors are only because I didn't
want to put anything.

102
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,750
I didn't want to file anything in a,
in a straight.

103
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,290
Um,
I think if you put something in a file

104
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:26,291
that says war poems or love pumps,
but you already restrict the way in

105
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:30,230
which the pole might move.
If I put it in blue,

106
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,220
it could be sad blue,
it could be happy blue,

107
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:39,221
it can be peaceful blue.
But my mood at the moment when I'm about

108
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:42,690
to work on that poem wants,
will,

109
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,370
will tell me where I want to go.
So it's an odd process,

110
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,880
but I do do lots of revisions and I love
to revise.

111
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,820
So 30,
40 revisions is not unusual at this

112
00:06:55,821 --> 00:07:00,080
stage.
I do most of my revisions by myself

113
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:05,081
until I reach a point where I either
need to give it lots of time because

114
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,310
time is a great reviser to,
you know,

115
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,120
just months of,
of uh,

116
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,000
putting it aside or I will show it.
A lot of times I'll show it to my

117
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,410
husband who is a novelist and as a prose
writer,

118
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,290
he has a totally different take on
things.

119
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,290
So he comes at it a different way.
Um,

120
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,660
I yearned for those old days,
you know,

121
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,410
from graduate school and you go into a
workshop and people would give you all

122
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,920
these ideas and you take it away from
him.

123
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,070
But at this point,
um,

124
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,360
that just doesn't,
it's not in the current.

125
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:43,361
So
I think it's both.

126
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,410
I think that,
that you certainly don't have to be aged

127
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,530
and you know,
and,

128
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,710
and travel the world to write a poem,
in fact sometimes traveling the world

129
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:55,310
is,
is,

130
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,310
is a way of not writing a poem,
but it's the quality of experiences

131
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,300
being able to,
to experience something.

132
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,830
And
when you begin to write about it,

133
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,950
be able to apply the tools that you need
for writing,

134
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,610
you know,
a mastery of the language in a way of,

135
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,131
of,
of,

136
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:19,700
of piecing together the language.
I guess

137
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,990
that those two factors have to come
together.

138
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:29,290
So you do need to be to work at it,
but you also have to be able to know

139
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:33,860
when to,
when to take the experience as it

140
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:36,230
happened,
when to tweak it a little bit,

141
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,190
what part of the experience is going to
move somebody else or what part is

142
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,460
really your own private moment?
So I've,

143
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:51,380
I've seen poems written by very young
people which are absolutely stunning and

144
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:55,010
of course we have examples of bod layer
and wrote.

145
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,540
He was in his teens.
These were amazing poem.

146
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:01,290
So he obviously didn't have a wealth of
experience or age or anything like that.

147
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,370
And I've seen pumps which of course
could only have been written by someone

148
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:10,371
who was older and had lived a certain
stages of life,

149
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,730
have gone through certain stages of
life.

150
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,220
But it's a combination of the two really
is,

151
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,070
you know,
I,

152
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,890
I've always felt that the,
the poems I've written,

153
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:30,891
which have historical contexts
are hopefully not just simply plucking

154
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:35,910
something out of history and saying,
oh great,

155
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:36,840
let's write about that.

156
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,160
In every case,
what has happened is that I've become

157
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,490
fascinated or haunted by something and
couldn't shake it as an African

158
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:48,090
American,
as a woman,

159
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,620
I think that I've been sensitized to the
way of which history of privileges of

160
00:09:56,401 --> 00:10:01,200
white male and the way in which certain
aspects of history,

161
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,400
the things that we are taught in school,
the things that are handed down,

162
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,340
never,
never entered the picture,

163
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,940
but they might've been very important.
Anyone can tell you that,

164
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,120
uh,
at the risk of over simplification,

165
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:16,860
let me say that anyone can tell you
that,

166
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,023
that,
that,

167
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,180
how you're raised as a child has a great
deal to do with how you behave as an

168
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:25,050
adult and,
uh,

169
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,910
whether you have complexes or whether
you need to prove yourself or all that

170
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:29,880
kind of stuff.
And yet

171
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,800
the mother in a traditional family who
has raised chuck never makes it in the

172
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:38,070
history books.

173
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,480
I mean,
and so,

174
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,590
so those kinds of things have always
irritated me.

175
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,540
Let's put it that way.
And I'm,

176
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,440
and I'm always reminded when I,
when I see someone,

177
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,370
Napoleon's stocks through the
battlefields.

178
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,570
And I think,
yeah,

179
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,000
but how do you get that way?
How this guy become who he was.

180
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,480
So that's,
that's the predisposition I have.

181
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,600
I think us as a writer,
as a person

182
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,240
who wanted to create poetry,
that's one of the things that has always

183
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:13,830
been one of my
things I carry along with me

184
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,890
each time is different.
For instance,

185
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:21,070
in this new book,
which is a tells the story of a,

186
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,480
of a black mixed race violin is George
Bridgetown who grew up in 18th and 19th

187
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:33,780
century Europe.
I came upon him because I was watching a

188
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:37,500
movie immortal beloved,
and there was a scene in which Beethoven

189
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:42,120
walks by a group of musicians and
there's this black violence on my,

190
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,310
what I've heard of color of my casting
because it's a bit strange.

191
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,700
And so I looked him up and the,
I didn't intend to write poems.

192
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:55,280
I above it.
Um,

193
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:00,130
I just wanted to know more about it and
I kept reading and the more I read,

194
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,700
the more I realized the only way I was
going to get him out of my head was to

195
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,700
get into his start writing down.
So in each case it's,

196
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,160
it's been something like that.

197
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,770
I think it's going to be a mix of
things.

198
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:21,720
What I find very interesting,
well first of all,

199
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:26,721
poetry of all the forms of literature I
think is the most suited for the digital

200
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,220
age and for the shorter attention spans
and all of that.

201
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,391
It,
it,

202
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:37,550
twitter's very easily some lyric pumps
and um,

203
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,730
it's very easy to zip up home to
someone.

204
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:44,960
So that's,
that's one of the things I think

205
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:50,040
wonderful
about poetry in the digital age.

206
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,520
I think that is going to be a mix
between people who will really only need

207
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,880
to see a book on a page and those who
will only want to hear on the stage.

208
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,900
I want to hear the hear the oral word.
What's interesting about the digital age

209
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:12,711
is because of all of the
ways in which we have of transporting

210
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,240
moving images now and making it very
portable.

211
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,700
The oral aspect of portraits coming back
in the portrait began as an oral

212
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:28,350
discipline and we had the printing press
and then it became gradually something

213
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:29,370
which,
uh,

214
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,360
began to lose a little bit of its
musicality because now we could read it.

215
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,910
So all of the rhymed pumps,
which,

216
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,810
you know,
all the formal homes,

217
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,580
which certainly began as a way of,
of,

218
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:45,840
um,
helping us remember a poem as an aid to

219
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:48,590
memory it,
that wasn't necessary anymore.

220
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,240
We moved away from that.
Now we have spoken word,

221
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,770
right.
It's coming back in.

222
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,320
So it's,
it's absolutely fascinating to me.

223
00:13:55,321 --> 00:13:59,190
I think it's going to change a little
bit more,

224
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:04,170
become a little bit more musical and
we'll have a whole range of things.

225
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:09,230
But it's an exciting time.
My first advice would be to read,

226
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,711
read,
read it,

227
00:14:12,711 --> 00:14:14,770
which sounds interesting coming in a
digital age,

228
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:19,771
but it's so much easier to listen to
upon it is to sit down and actually read

229
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:25,120
it and to hear it in your head.
And that's something that,

230
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:30,630
that every poet or aspiring poet needs
to be able to do anything to hear it in

231
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:33,910
their head.
What I wish someone had told me,

232
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,460
hmm,

233
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,340
I wish someone had told me that

234
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:50,150
my stories
are really mine to tell another with

235
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,250
anything that um,
I think is important or that that has

236
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:59,750
moved me,
has the ability to move somebody else.

237
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,120
It was a long process too for me.
And I think for many young poets to be

238
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:12,860
able to realize that even the smallest,
the most domestic,

239
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,750
uh,
experience can move someone else.

240
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,710
It doesn't have to be about,
um,

241
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,720
the Trojan war,
you know,

242
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,730
doesn't have to be the Elliot.
It doesn't,

243
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,670
uh,
it doesn't have to be something that,

244
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,541
again,
here,

245
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,510
we'll get to history that,
that makes it to the front page of the

246
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:36,260
news.
But we live our lives in detail.

247
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,540
All of us,
we walked down the street,

248
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,720
we breathe,
we hear things,

249
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,970
we try to transcribe it in generalities
and the details are what make us come

250
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,870
alive.
And I wish someone had said that just at

251
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:53,030
the beginning.
So I wouldn't have felt so discouraged

252
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:57,200
when I began writing and thinking who
would want to hear the stories of a

253
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:59,250
young black girl?
You know,

254
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,170
growing up in the Midwest,
you know,

255
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,230
that's not interesting.
I have to live in Paris.

256
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,363
No,
you don't.

257
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,510
I'm not thinking of my audience,
which does not mean that I'm doing it

258
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:13,320
for myself.
Uh,

259
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,450
I'm thinking at the very beginning when
I begin writing a poem,

260
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:22,570
I try not to think of the audience or
anyone at all except for trying to get

261
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,850
at the very center of what's driving
that poem.

262
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,850
Why,
why?

263
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,600
In a way it's like analyzing myself.
Why did I even sit down to write this?

264
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,260
Why is it even interesting?
What is it that drives this thing that

265
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:47,261
means excess assets in the that means
going down into the very deepest

266
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,730
psychological moments.
Things that can frightened and scare you

267
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,750
and I think that to think of an audience
at that point would actually drive those

268
00:16:58,491 --> 00:17:03,460
thoughts away.
But during the process of revision and

269
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,500
what happens is that I'm thinking about
the language and how I can use the

270
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:14,030
language,
which is my tool to convey whatever this

271
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:19,570
experience slash emotion is so that if
anyone else sits down to read it,

272
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,000
they can also feel it.

273
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,300
So it's beyond just saying,
talking about describing something is

274
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,580
also using words would help to shape the
emotion so that if it's supposed to be

275
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:38,240
something very hectic
or a frantic moment,

276
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,410
then the words probably would be shorter
and clipped and

277
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,600
things like that.
During that revision process it becomes

278
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,590
less and less a private matter and
Baltimore,

279
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,880
something for an anonymous audience.
I don't try to imagine a an audience in

280
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:02,850
the sense of at that stage I don't try
to imagine the audience in the sense of,

281
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,910
well these are all educated people,
you know,

282
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:10,911
from the ages of 18 to 45.
I just think of there is someone out

283
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:17,790
there who might want to read this.
If they read this little bit.

284
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,410
I want to get them to feel the same
thing that I'm feeling and that's my

285
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:25,860
audience,
but that in the end I'm thinking only of

286
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:27,360
them and I'm not there.

287
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,950
It would be wonderful if we were
striving for toward a post racial

288
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:42,000
literature and certainly the election of
Obama is a big step on the way.

289
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,180
I think that we shouldn't get complacent
and think,

290
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:46,920
oh gosh,
now we're post racial.

291
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:51,150
We are not,
we haven't had the conversations we need

292
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:56,151
to have about race and privilege and all
of that stuff up.

293
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,240
We're starting,
so we're on our way,

294
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,100
but one of the things that I've always
dreamed of is to have a post racial

295
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:10,130
literature at you waste so much energy
and good a talent.

296
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,420
I'm either trying to insist upon your
presence,

297
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:20,421
which is certainly what happened in the
black arts movement in the sixties for

298
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:23,920
instance.
Uh,

299
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,070
and you also waste a lot of energy then.
I'm

300
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,570
sorry,
I lost my thought.

301
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,510
Well,
you wasted a lot of energy insisting

302
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:42,940
upon your presence,
but then you also can waste a lot of

303
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:46,990
energy explaining things,
explaining things which are specific to

304
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:50,680
your,
to a certain racial culture,

305
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:55,060
which if you think about it in terms of
the mainstream,

306
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,080
we don't mind looking things up if we
don't understand them,

307
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:04,530
but we kind of expect to be clued in on
various things that happened in,

308
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,210
in the culture.
One of the things that I've always found

309
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,350
frustrating are the little reference
points that

310
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,900
I might have to explain it,
a poem that I wouldn't have to explain

311
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,790
if it were in it,
if,

312
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,520
if it were a mainstream detail.
For instance,

313
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:34,410
I know exactly how a white woman would
do her hair every morning.

314
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,760
I know the washing and the blow drying
and all of that kinds of stuff.

315
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,170
But so that if I see that in a poem,
if it were to occur in a poem,

316
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,770
um,
then I would have problem with it.

317
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:53,010
Whereas for me to,
to even to get up and explain getting up

318
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:59,011
and rushing in and how to do my hair,
it would require all sorts of glosses.

319
00:20:59,081 --> 00:20:59,741
You know,
I'd have to say,

320
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:00,251
well,
yes,

321
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:02,710
there's the,
there's the hair pomade and there's the

322
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:04,170
visit.
And uh,

323
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:08,170
and,
and so my hope is that in a,

324
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,690
in a post racial,
cultural,

325
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:15,040
all these kinds of details,
we will just assume that we can figure

326
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,020
them out.
And we will assume that that is

327
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,230
something as we read them,
that will,

328
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,960
we'll have to look up instead of
demanding that our writers,

329
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,410
um,
give us a gloss right in the middle of

330
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,060
the palm.
I think we're on our way.

331
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,870
It's so funny,
when I was poet laureate,

332
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,390
when I be,
when I was named poet laureate and went

333
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:40,660
down to Washington a little bit
beforehand to meet,

334
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,040
um,
the,

335
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,290
uh,
assistant and meet the Librarian of

336
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,470
Congress and all that into,
to kind of acclimate myself.

337
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:52,471
And I did ask what my duties were,
the only official duties are to a

338
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,980
sponsor,
a reading series at the library of

339
00:21:56,981 --> 00:22:00,240
Congress twice a month and make sure
that.

340
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,210
So that was fun too,
to be able to invite poets from all over

341
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:09,130
the world actually to come to read and
to read for the archives.

342
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,640
That was wonderful fish.
Dory.

343
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,190
The other duty was to advise the library
of Congress,

344
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,640
the Librarian of Congress,
and also,

345
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:24,300
and this was the funny one,
to promote poetry in any way that I see

346
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:27,280
fit.
I said,

347
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:29,950
what does that mean to promote poetry?

348
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,230
And
I said,

349
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,450
well,
what's the budget because you're going

350
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:35,284
to promote you,
but,

351
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,870
and I got to kind of a blank stare.
So I thought,

352
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,660
okay,
this means that you make it up as you go

353
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:41,494
along.
What else?

354
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,400
The,
the,

355
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,550
you know,
I'm an artist I could create and I

356
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:47,230
decided to just do things,
um,

357
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,340
and fear they would stop me if they
didn't have enough money,

358
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:57,060
which was probably a good way to go
about it because they did find money

359
00:22:57,641 --> 00:22:58,750
for,
for various things.

360
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,760
But what was interesting,
it's not a,

361
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,360
it's sort of like being Miss America for
poetry.

362
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,330
And that as a,
as the poet laureate,

363
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,170
you have an immediate,
um,

364
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,130
cache and you have some,
you have stairs,

365
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:17,260
people see you have some kind of
publicity,

366
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,770
some kind of a public stage.
And I thought of myself as being more

367
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:25,900
like a lightning rod.

368
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,400
People would say,
oh,

369
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:30,310
there's a poet laureate,
let's ask her or

370
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,100
tell her what to do.
And I got so many letters right from the

371
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:39,500
beginning,
from people all over this country.

372
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:44,501
He's telling me what I should do.
And some of them were really good ideas,

373
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,260
so,
and I couldn't implement all of them and

374
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,250
the time I was there,
the two years I was there,

375
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,700
the one thing that I found very,
very helpful was to remember that many

376
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:59,660
people are very frightened of poetry.
And as poet laureate,

377
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:04,661
I had a chance to travel around to just
inject poetry in to everyday life

378
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:10,430
whenever I could.
And so I visited grade school kids or

379
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:13,220
the naval academy and with all sorts of
places where,

380
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,780
where you thought,
you know,

381
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,030
didn't know they liked poetry or poetry
was absolutely necessary.

382
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,260
So,
um,

383
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:26,350
each poet laureate decide kind of what,
how they want to use that public arena.

384
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,200
And I decided to to try to just
be there and people's faces whenever the

385
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,610
they turned around to make poetry
something that was all around us.

386
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,760
I went on Sesame Street for instance.
And,

387
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,841
and,
and,

388
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:43,640
uh,
yeah,

389
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:45,880
it was really fun.
The other thing that happens with poet,

390
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,000
the poet Laureateship,
is that when you are.

391
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,720
When I was in Washington,
there was an opportunity to inject

392
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,960
poetry into the government.
And the other lawyer does not have to

393
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:06,800
write official poems or anything.
There were many occasions when I would

394
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:11,150
be asked to say a few words,
which is of course a kind of a euphemism

395
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:11,481
for,
to,

396
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:13,550
you have a poem was there's always a
poem.

397
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:16,730
You can always find a poem for almost
any human situation.

398
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:20,360
So I didn't write poems or for specific
events,

399
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,860
but,
um,

400
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:27,370
I could look and see if I had a poem
which would fit in that because I think

401
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:30,380
that it's always important.

402
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:35,380
It's important if,
if there's a celebration for some bill

403
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:40,220
being passed,
it's nice to have a poem there to remind

404
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:43,880
us all of the human element and the
human effort that went behind it.

405
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:46,580
So that was,
that was important to,

406
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,870
um,
the,

407
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:56,180
the Penguin Anthology of 20th century
American poetry

408
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,340
is a Gargantuan,
Gargantuan project.

409
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,080
And basically,
uh,

410
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,980
I'm trying to make sense poetically,
of the 20th century in America.

411
00:26:09,321 --> 00:26:14,321
So it starts,
I'm really right there with 'em

412
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:22,630
at Arlington Robinson and it goes up
until anything published in the year

413
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:27,440
2000.
I'm trying.

414
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:32,470
So what the difference in the center
algae is instead of just a poem here

415
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:37,871
upon their two pubs where this person
trying to give a sense of of major

416
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,250
poets who then influenced other poets as
well,

417
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:49,251
so that we may be quite a few poems by
say let's choose someone William Carlos

418
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:57,230
Williams and then show how he influenced
all sorts of other poets who may have a

419
00:26:57,601 --> 00:27:00,870
few other,
not as many poems in the oncology.

420
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,200
What makes a classic poem.
I think that when a poem can move

421
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:20,230
readers across
generations and across its specific

422
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,890
class or race,
then it becomes truly classic.

423
00:27:27,891 --> 00:27:28,581
I mean,
in other words,

424
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:33,581
if the poem is so moving that even if
you have no experience in that

425
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,470
particular setting,
be it 19 twenties,

426
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,500
Harlem,
let's say you still are so moved that,

427
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,050
that,
that you can put yourself in that

428
00:27:48,051 --> 00:27:52,010
position.
That means that the writer has managed

429
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,790
to go beyond the,
the,

430
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:59,930
the personal and,
and touch the humanity in all of us.

431
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:05,720
And it's been really a blast to read it
because I realized how,

432
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,960
um,
that this does hold true for the truly

433
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:13,961
great poems.
Oh Gosh,

434
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,100
no,
there's not a specific poem.

435
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,010
There they are,
it changes,

436
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,820
changes depending on the,
on the,

437
00:28:19,821 --> 00:28:22,310
um,
what I'm working with,

438
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:24,770
where I'm at at the moment,
but

439
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,260
there are,
I mean,

440
00:28:27,261 --> 00:28:29,810
they're just poems that are just so
amazing to me.

441
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,500
Um,
and I,

442
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,220
and if I named one that I course lose
another,

443
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:35,540
but,
but it,

444
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,030
it goes in and out,
I think that.

445
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,380
Hmm,
let me think.

446
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,760
I can't name a specific one lines flow
through my head.

447
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,133
There's a,

448
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,960
a very beautiful German poem by Gerta,
which I often say to myself because it's

449
00:29:01,681 --> 00:29:05,610
like a little prayer and uh,
but it's also totally untranslatable

450
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:09,690
I've never been able to translate it.
And um,

451
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,250
it's humbling because you realize the,
we need translators.

452
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,121
Please,
please,

453
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,500
please,
we need our translators.

454
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,050
Otherwise we'll never have any of these
posts,

455
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:23,670
would never know who,
how bottom layer moves us or anything

456
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:27,100
like that.
But you also realize how much gets lost,

457
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,160
how,
how necessarily poetry is so bonded to

458
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:37,800
the,
to the language in which it is composed

459
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,930
that it's,
you're,

460
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,730
you're always going to lose.
And I find that very humbling.

461
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,980
Um,
so

462
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,810
yeah,
but it's a wonderful woman that rhymes,

463
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:52,210
but it rhymes in odd ways about other
gifts

464
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,580
and I live vip spirit.
His Stu calm.

465
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:04,100
I'd how Baltimore binder who was out.
That's it.

466
00:30:07,371 --> 00:30:10,290
And you can hear the rhymes and
basically transfer it.

467
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:15,310
It says overall the mountains.
Tranquility

468
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,210
rests
in all of the tips of the trees and

469
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:23,950
that's VIP for which is a great little
winter.

470
00:30:23,951 --> 00:30:28,951
All the tops of the trees you can.
You can hardly feel a breath.

471
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,320
Wait.
Just wait.

472
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:38,230
Soon.
Youtube will rest.

473
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,920
And it's just,
it's because of the minds that make this

474
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:48,970
such a calm and it's just in certain
words that totally untranslatable like

475
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:53,770
vip,
which does mean tips of the trees,

476
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,900
but that doesn't sound very good in
English,

477
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,063
but it,
it's,

478
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:02,130
it's almost rocks you to sleep and I
just find it incredibly amazing poem

479
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,960
tightness.
And yet tranquility

480
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:14,180
could let me think.
What could I do a longterm?

481
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,560
I'll read one,
I'll read a short one and a,

482
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,200
but I have to give you a little gloss
for it.

483
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,680
I'm
in.

484
00:31:35,141 --> 00:31:39,010
This poem is from my new Book Sonata
Melodica,

485
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:41,110
which tells the story of George Bridge
Tower,

486
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,610
a Mulatto violinist from the 18th and
19th centuries.

487
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,000
In this poem,
he was a prodigy.

488
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:53,590
He's a little boy,
10 years old in England playing his

489
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:58,591
violin in front of all of the music
lovers of London,

490
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,550
and his father is sent back,
sent away from London.

491
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,900
The Prince of Wales says,
I'll take care of the little boy,

492
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,420
and so you have this little boy who is
has the best job in the world for a

493
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:15,550
musician,
but at the same time he has no family,

494
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:21,330
and in this poem the prince has ordered
him to go into as women to change into

495
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:28,120
British clothing.
The undressing

496
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,870
first,
the sash peacock,

497
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:36,871
blue silk unfurling round and round
until I'm the India ink darting a called

498
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,920
British.
Now I can bend to peel off my shoes,

499
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:48,190
try to hook the tasseled tips into the
emerald sales of my set and pantaloons

500
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,170
fair.
Well sir,

501
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:53,310
monkey jacket,
monkey red,

502
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,960
a do shirt,
tart and bright as the lemons.

503
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,590
The prince once.
Let me touch goodbye.

504
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:03,800
Lakeside metal,
goodbye hummingbird throat.

505
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,020
No more games.
I am to become a proper British

506
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,080
gentlemen cuffed and buckled with
breaches and I find Krevak,

507
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:21,130
but how my tossed bedclothes while I.
I am a smudge acquainted wick.

508
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,190
A twig shrouded in snow.
