1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,020
In terms of the,
the skill of executing stories,

2
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,100
I would say we're getting better.
That's,

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,080
that's one thing.
Okay.

4
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:22,780
I think clearly when I,
for example,

5
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:27,220
I mentioned the series damages and in
fact that was just an article in the New

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,090
York magazine the other day about
damages and they brilliant way in which

7
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:34,480
that that series does something,
um,

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,720
that really never been explored quite
that way before.

9
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,170
They use flash forwards as hooks.
They give you glimpses of the future,

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,950
but only glimpses.
And so that they put you in a state of

11
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:50,260
semi dramatic irony.
You know,

12
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:54,070
more than the character knows the
character is going to die.

13
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,960
Okay?
You know that this character is going to

14
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:57,010
die.
Then you go,

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,410
you flash forward to their death,
all right?

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,570
And now you're watching,
you go back and you're watching them in

17
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:02,560
the present.
So you know what?

18
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:03,100
He doesn't know.

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,950
You know that he's going to die,
but you don't know how and why he's

20
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:08,620
going to die.
And so,

21
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:10,060
um,
and they don't know who did it,

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,780
who killed him and so forth.
And so there's lots of hooky questions

23
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:18,310
and curiosity,
but it's also a bit of a dramatic irony.

24
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,950
That's amazing.
I mean,

25
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:22,420
they,
when you see it,

26
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:24,490
you wonder why hasn't this been done
before?

27
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,880
Right.
And so in terms of executing stories,

28
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,560
I would say that it's,
um,

29
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,620
that the techniques are better than,
than ever in terms of the content of the

30
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:37,300
stories.
That's another question.

31
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,540
And in terms of what these stories are
about,

32
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,910
what they,
the depth to which they,

33
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,400
they bring their characters.
Uh,

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,760
I would say no,
we're where it's the stories are more

35
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:52,990
shallow overall.
That's a huge generalization.

36
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,170
But,
and postmodernism itself,

37
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,800
by definition mean shadowing us.
It means a satire of the techniques or

38
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:03,430
writing okay.

39
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,580
Calling attention to the techniques of
writing.

40
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:11,080
And that of course divorces you from the
content by the very nature of it.

41
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,860
And so in this post postmodern world,
wherever we are now,

42
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,320
um,
I would say that as a,

43
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:22,410
as a grand generalization,
that the content of stories are not the

44
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:28,141
quality that they were in the 50 golden
years from the 1920s to the 1970s on

45
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,860
stage page and screen everywhere in the
world,

46
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,650
especially the English speaking world,
the films,

47
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:39,670
the plays and the novels of that period
were magnificent in content.

48
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,290
And so we've learned to be more clever,
more experimental.

49
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,950
And I'm more skilled often in the
telling of stories today,

50
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:51,250
but I can't say that the content is what
they used to be.

51
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,380
I never lose faith in story.
Film may come and go as an art form and

52
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:08,741
be art forms have come and gone opera
more or less came and went and then just

53
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:13,390
gets revived endlessly.
There's very little cutting edge opera

54
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:14,830
today.
Um,

55
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,360
their,
their art forms that a rise up and

56
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:22,720
dominate a period of time in human
history and then receipt.

57
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,020
And so it film goes through that and
recedes.

58
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,440
So what,
because there will always be story and

59
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:31,330
um,
and the,

60
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,130
the,
the medium of the future I think is

61
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:35,980
television,
but certainly the novel and the theater

62
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:36,730
is still,
um,

63
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,400
uh,
alive and well for the most part,

64
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,010
despite some pretty mediocre
storytelling.

65
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,210
And so,
um,

66
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,130
the,
the art of storytelling,

67
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,300
the artist's story I never worry about.
People will always tell stories and they

68
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:51,730
will tell really great stories,
beautiful stories,

69
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,480
but the medium
of the future,

70
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,810
the medium that writers choose to,
to do what is the best work in the

71
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:06,730
future that changes human beings.
A great critic,

72
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,760
once Kenneth Burke said it,
stories are equipment for living.

73
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Human beings need storytelling in order
to make sense out of life in order to

74
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:19,930
live as well and civilized as a human
being can.

75
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,350
And so they,
they will go to the storyteller,

76
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,410
uh,
for meaningful emotional experiences

77
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:28,960
that they can I get from life.
And then it just,

78
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,070
it just a matter of of which medium the
storytellers of the future choose to,

79
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,130
to dominate that period in time.
And then that's two will change in time.

80
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,500
The time that people spend in stories
created for them by a storytelling

81
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,590
artists today compared to 50 a hundred
years ago.

82
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:54,550
I mean it's,
it's triple or quadruple what it used to

83
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:55,870
be.
Um,

84
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,330
do they need it more?
Maybe you could make an argument that

85
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,660
the disintegration and relativization of
values in contemporary society,

86
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:12,630
society is so blurring that people
desperately need stories to help them

87
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:17,290
make sense out of life.
Because what we used to agree upon,

88
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,070
nobody agrees on anymore.
Society is,

89
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,430
you know,
this is obvious,

90
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:25,390
but it's so,
it's so splintered and so split.

91
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,400
And I mean,
there's a spectrum.

92
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,760
[inaudible] excuse me.
There's a spectrum that runs from,

93
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,020
uh,
I am my brother's keeper to every man

94
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:40,021
for himself and that on that we call
that liberals and then the right

95
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,480
conservatives.
And,

96
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,480
um,
this argument over are we are our

97
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:51,481
brother's keeper or is it every man for
themself is never been more ugly

98
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,260
and,
and fragmenting of,

99
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,460
of society.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,030
And so people are clustering now in,
in,

101
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,330
depending upon their position on that,
on that spectrum of caring or not

102
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:09,740
caring,
um,

103
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,080
in such ways that they cannot even talk
to people who are anywhere else on that

104
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:17,750
spectrum.
And as a result,

105
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,080
uh,
there's more chaos in daily life and

106
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,470
then throw in a,
a,

107
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,070
a the great recession and a few other
chaos is like wars and,

108
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,840
uh,
people are desperate and they need

109
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:30,651
story.
Yeah.

110
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:34,250
I think you could make an argument now,
are they getting the quality of stories

111
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,650
a comic or tragic that would help them
live through this,

112
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,860
this really ugly period in history?
Probably not.

113
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,180
Uh,
but the writers do their best because

114
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:49,130
the writers are just citizens too,
you know,

115
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,970
and they're,
they're,

116
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,020
they've got no necessarily more
philosophical or psychological insight

117
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,570
into this than,
um,

118
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,830
than anybody else.
And so they,

119
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,630
the writer has to be a philosopher of a
kind today that they've never had to be

120
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:07,970
before.
They have to make sense out of a kind of

121
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:10,490
chaos.
The no one ever confronted before.

122
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,090
I mean,
the worst thing that in,

123
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,740
you know,
a hundred years ago or,

124
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,520
and the worst thing that could happen is
you die.

125
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:23,420
[inaudible] so people told stories about
how to live well or live meaningfully if

126
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:25,430
you could,
or the or tragedy,

127
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,211
one of the,
you know,

128
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:28,190
but,
but death was the worst thing.

129
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,450
Well,
there's far worse things now,

130
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,280
far worse things and,
um,

131
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,900
um,
and people are literally

132
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,350
living health.
Could they,

133
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,550
they'd be better off dead all around the
world.

134
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,010
The suffering and the third world today
is of an extreme that the third world

135
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,840
has never suffered before.
Because generally speaking,

136
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:54,050
in the Third World,
people didn't starve to death.

137
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:58,560
They could farm.
But even that in many ways has been

138
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,680
lost.
Um,

139
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,600
I,
you know,

140
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,570
for a lot of reasons,
but yeah.

141
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:04,970
Okay.

142
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,803
The world is,
um,

143
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,500
is a,
in a worse state than I,

144
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,160
I,
that I know from history that people

145
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:11,530
would probably say,
well,

146
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:16,590
the black plague was,
um,

147
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,210
but I don't think so.
She,

148
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:22,200
because people understood the plague,
you get sick and you die.

149
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,740
Who can understand the banking system,
who can understand love,

150
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,500
who can understand?
Um,

151
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,423
uh,
parenting.

152
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,210
Yeah.

153
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,650
I mean,
these things that people thought they

154
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:37,270
knew,
they don't know anymore.

155
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,850
And so the,
the plague at least was clear.

156
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,710
It's terrible.
But it was clear.

157
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,950
The problem for people today is
confusion.

158
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,810
Uh,
in a world that should make sense and

159
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,090
wanting what you have more communication
than ever makes it less and less sense

160
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:55,090
than ever.
And so you need storytellers to make

161
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,190
sense out of that chaos.
But it says that it's a chaos of a very

162
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,960
different kind today.
And,

163
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,880
um,
the writers struggles.

164
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:08,790
Yeah.
