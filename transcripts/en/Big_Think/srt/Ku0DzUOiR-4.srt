00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,090
My name is Jonathan Keats and I am an
experimental philosophers.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,900
What that means is that I do things like
open a restaurant for plants.

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,680
I sell real estate in the extra
dimensions of space.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,280
I choreograph ballets for honeybees.
I build systems by which you can become

5
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:34,090
married by a law of nature using quantum
mechanics.

6
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,650
I even attempt to genetically engineer
God.

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,640
All of these are rather absurd on the
surface and me not seem especially

8
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:49,810
practical in your everyday life.
However,

9
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:54,790
I think that there are some basic
lessons that can be extracted from them

10
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:00,060
that at least for me are highly useful
even when I am not pursuing experimental

11
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:05,650
philosophy even when I am simply trying
to get by in the world.

12
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,600
Basic ways in which an experimental
philosopher looks at the world.

13
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,900
That can be divided perhaps into five
lessons and I'm going to go over these

14
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:17,704
with you.

15
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,270
By way of example,
looking at some of the projects that I

16
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:27,271
have undertaken with the takeaway that
you might be able to apply these rules,

17
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,090
either to undertake your own experiment
in philosophy or simply that you can use

18
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:38,620
these in your creative problem solving
at work or at home.

19
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,660
The lessons can be very briefly
summarized as follows,

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,240
ask naive questions,
invert perceptions,

21
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,890
combining compatible ideas,
remix metaphors,

22
00:01:53,891 --> 00:01:58,891
and pursue paradox.
By no means are these comprehensive and

23
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,470
the rather Glib.
Yet I think that if you take these as a

24
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:09,751
point of departure as I sometimes do,
you'll find that you get outside of

25
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:15,880
yourself in terms of your routines,
your education,

26
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,210
and your common sense.
And you start to look at the world in

27
00:02:19,211 --> 00:02:24,130
different ways that may lead you to
ideas that you never knew that you had.

28
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,180
And so I would like to invite you to
join me in this workshop in experimental

29
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:35,320
philosophy here on Big Pink Mentor.
