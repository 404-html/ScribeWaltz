1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,330
I'm optimistic because I said
global community is moving in the right

2
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:16,520
direction
at the,

3
00:00:16,521 --> 00:00:21,380
the concerts that took place prior to
Nelson Mandela's release for people,

4
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,800
people like Peter Gabriel,
the songs like Steve Biko,

5
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,710
uh,
that and saw my dad is released that

6
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:31,190
brought about the end of apartheid.
And you know,

7
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:33,620
that those great concerts where,
you know,

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,473
we're,
we're,

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,831
you know,
we're,

10
00:00:35,831 --> 00:00:36,360
we're,
uh,

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,010
a sign of the times,
I think the wonderful concerts that are

12
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:41,850
taking place on the,
in,

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,000
on,
on global warming and concerts.

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,280
That's a sign of the times.
It shows that,

15
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,460
you know,
that people are now wanting their voices

16
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:51,290
to be heard and governments are going to
have to listen.
