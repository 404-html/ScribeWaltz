1
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,180
They're all jumbled,
they're all jumbled together,

2
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:14,960
but they really are associated with both
my grandmothers.

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,063
Um,
my father's mother who died when I was 

4
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:18,894
pretty young,
I do remember going into her house and 

5
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:24,210
she lived in a walkup tenement in the 
bronx where my father grew up.

6
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:26,550
She lived in the same apartment in which
my father grew up.

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,970
Um,
and I do remember her making blitzes are

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,230
Paragi or something like that from 
scratch,

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,000
making the dough,
rolling it out,

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,170
filling it with cheese or potatoes and 
cooking them in that.

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:43,663
No,
that was pretty incredible because I 

12
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:46,400
don't have,
my mother didn't do that stuff,

13
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:49,250
so I don't have a lot of that,
but I have that little bit of that.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,533
And then my other grandmother,
she was the one who really did the big 

15
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:55,634
family functions and would cook for 15 
and 20 people at once and would scream 

16
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:01,610
at everybody in the kitchen and Dadada.
And she made.

17
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:02,803
She made very,
very classic Eastern European Jewish 

18
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:08,300
food and,
and was good at it.

19
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,623
Um,
I don't remember anything particular 

20
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,220
mean.
I remember eating many different things.

21
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:14,720
I don't have a single memory though.

22
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,940
Um,
it's kind of self defense.

23
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:21,601
I,
I,

24
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:22,434
um,
I grew up in New York and the food was 

25
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,890
interesting,
varied,

26
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:30,600
not particularly great at home,
but out on the streets it was good.

27
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:32,940
And in some of my friends' parents 
houses it was good.

28
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:33,774
And um,
then I went away to school in 

29
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:37,110
Massachusetts where the food was 
abysmal.

30
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,343
Um,
and I started cooking out of self 

31
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:41,191
defense.
I mean,

32
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:42,024
it's just the only way I could imagine 
to get halfway decent food was to learn 

33
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:47,160
how to make it myself.
And it really began there.

34
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:48,330
And then,
um,

35
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,170
continued through a series of roommates,
some of whom cooked in,

36
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,004
some didn't,
but all of whom were interested in what 

37
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:56,880
I,
what I was cooking,

38
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,730
sorry,
it's just following recipes.

39
00:02:00,731 --> 00:02:02,590
I mean,
there was no training but they were good

40
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:03,880
recipes.
So it worked.

41
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,220
And then,
um,

42
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,430
then I had a child who started cooking 
for her and then,

43
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,383
and then I started writing about food.
At that point I knew it had been eight 

44
00:02:15,111 --> 00:02:18,140
or 10 years.
Then I knew enough about food to write a

45
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:21,470
little about it and then no pun 
intended,

46
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,363
they fed off of each other.
So I was writing about food and I was 

47
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:27,980
cooking and I had to cook in order to 
write better about food.

48
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,730
So there's incentive to cook more,
which gave me more to write about.

49
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,943
There you have it.
I still have not ever had any formal 

50
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:36,734
training.

51
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,920
Well,
let's just distinguish between chefs and

52
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:45,140
cooks because I think this is important.
And a chef,

53
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:46,490
as a person,
I,

54
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,350
you know,
I know that word is thrown around a lot,

55
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:50,390
but a chef as a person who runs the 
restaurant,

56
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,720
so people who cook at home or cooks,
there's nothing wrong with that.

57
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,740
Um,
people who like to cook our cooks and I,

58
00:02:57,741 --> 00:02:58,574
you know,
I think that that's a word that's been 

59
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,900
sadly denigrated.
And um,

60
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,690
um,
I think it's a lovely word.

61
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:06,790
It's an important word.
So what are the most experience,

62
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,800
what are the most important techniques 
for,

63
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,410
shall we say,
novice cooks?

64
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,653
I'm

65
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,820
well reading I think is probably a very 
important technique because probably the

66
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:25,821
best way to learn how to cook remains 
getting a couple of decent cookbooks and

67
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,263
working your way through them and paying
attention to what they're asking and 

68
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:33,510
learning a few of the terms and,
and,

69
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,890
and,
you know,

70
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,720
it's,
it's such an easy,

71
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:40,440
it's so much easier than playing tennis,
for example,

72
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:41,274
that um,
it's just a matter of starting to do it 

73
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:48,060
and then doing it over and over again 
until you kind of get it.

74
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,133
So it has more,
it's presented as a highly skilled 

75
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:53,394
occupation and indeed for real chefs or 
people running restaurants or people 

76
00:03:56,281 --> 00:04:01,281
doing demonstrations on food television,
it's not that easy,

77
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,700
but for most of us it's not any harder 
than driving a car.

78
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:06,534
It just needs a little practice off the 
top of my head without looking at my 

79
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:14,324
pantry.

80
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,480
A garlic olive oil.
That's too,

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,070
um,
it,

82
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,910
it sort of,
it,

83
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,190
it's a hard question because do you want
to count rice and Pasta?

84
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:29,540
Do you want to count vinegar and Lemons?
Do you want to count onions and eggs?

85
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:34,010
Maybe that gets you close to 10.
The thing is that there are,

86
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,080
I would say there are probably 30,
somewhere between 25 and 50,

87
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:42,044
but say 30 ingredients that should be 
pretty much in every kitchen all the 

88
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:46,970
time.
Ten is not going to do it.

89
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:49,490
You can't,
you can't do much with 10,

90
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,773
but if you have 30,
you can start doing serious cooking and 

91
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:55,770
if you have those 30,
um,

92
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,133
and you stop at the store and pick up a 
piece of meat or fish and some 

93
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:01,670
vegetables,
something fresh,

94
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,773
you're completely in business.
You can cook half of what there is to 

95
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:06,590
cook in all over the world.

96
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,960
That's an interesting question.
People don't use high enough heat,

97
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,900
uh,
and people don't preheat their pants and

98
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,480
their ovens and things like that enough.
Um,

99
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,843
if you really want to,
if you really want to put a crust on 

100
00:05:25,221 --> 00:05:28,010
something,
the pan needs to be hot.

101
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:29,870
The butter oil needs to be hot.
I mean,

102
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,990
these are things that trained people.
Learn home.

103
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:36,140
Cooks are a little afraid.
Tend to be a little of a beginning home.

104
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:38,540
Cooks tend to be a little afraid of high
heat,

105
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,383
so that's a mistake people make.
Having lousy knives is a mistake people 

106
00:05:44,451 --> 00:05:45,284
make and it's not.
It's not that they don't have expensive 

107
00:05:48,201 --> 00:05:50,030
knives,
it's that they don't have sharp knives.

108
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,723
On the other hand,
spending too much money on cooking 

109
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:55,184
equipment.
This is a mistake a lot of people make 

110
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:58,820
because you don't need to a lot of money
on cooking equipment.

111
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,760
What else can I think of?
Well,

112
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,030
attitude.
Attitude is interesting because,

113
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,390
um,
people tend to be intimidated by cooking

114
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:09,920
and there's nothing to be intimidated by
it.

115
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:11,990
As I said at the beginning,
it's really pretty simple.

116
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:16,991
So the right attitude is the attitude of
I'm going to get something going on,

117
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:18,410
it's going to be good.
It's not,

118
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,490
oh,
I'm afraid of this,

119
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:20,530
but nor is it.
Oh,

120
00:06:20,531 --> 00:06:23,900
I'm going to be bobby flay and do 
something breathtaking.

121
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,770
It's just going to be.
I'm going to try to,

122
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,370
just like my grandma had cooked for my 
mom,

123
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,460
I'm going to try to cook for my friends 
or my kids or whatever,

124
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:33,140
which is,
you know,

125
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:34,940
normal food,
the food you like.

126
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,753
Well,
spices in general go under appreciated 

127
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:41,954
by American cooks.
I mean the spices that that most 

128
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:47,120
Americans used in cooking tended to be 
the sort of,

129
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,120
you might call them warm spices are 
sweet spices,

130
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,460
like the kind of stuff you put an apple 
pie,

131
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,880
cinnamon,
all spice,

132
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,620
nutmeg,
cloves,

133
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,753
ginger,
a little bit of chilies are certainly 

134
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:03,500
becoming more and more popular in.
That's great.

135
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,393
Um,
mild chili powders is a wonderful 

136
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:09,040
ingredient that's still not fully 
appreciated.

137
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:09,741
P,
mentone,

138
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:14,390
which is mild smoked Paprika,
which is a form of Chili,

139
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:17,480
so mild smoked chili patterns,
Spanish ingredient,

140
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:22,481
really fabulous.
All the Indian spices or Asian spices,

141
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:25,340
however you want to call them,
tend to be under appreciated it.

142
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:26,830
And these are really simple things to 
use.

143
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,673
I think part of the problem is when you,
when you add four or five spices to a 

144
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,380
recipe,
makes the recipe look long,

145
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,480
makes the ingredient list look,
look long,

146
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,820
and no one wants to see a long 
ingredient list.

147
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,630
So when writing recipes,
one has to be careful,

148
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:43,490
but you know,
spices are really,

149
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:46,430
if you replace them every now and then 
so that they're fairly fresh,

150
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,860
they're there,
they're easy to use,

151
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:51,650
it's not a big deal and they make a huge
difference.

152
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,080
I often don't figure out what I'm 
cooking until an hour before people come

153
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:03,794
over,
but I make sure there's food in the 

154
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:07,730
house and that.
I think that's an important,

155
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:08,530
you know,
it's,

156
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,363
it seems so obvious when you say it,
but so many people don't do it if you 

157
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,244
have a lot of food in the house,
cooking as much easier because now you 

158
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:20,354
have so many options.
Plus there's pressure on you to cook 

159
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:25,070
because you don't want the stuff to go 
bad.

160
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,630
So what I cook for people pretty much 
depends on what I have.

161
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,750
I try to always have,
you know,

162
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,863
something I've made a deal with a friend
who was an architect and he designed an 

163
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:41,350
office for me.
And uh,

164
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,073
the deal was that I was going to cook 
dinner for him and his wife and two of 

165
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:50,600
his friends and my wife.
So they're going to be six of us and uh,

166
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,070
we set a date,
I guess he says we set a date and uh,

167
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,410
morning that afternoon actually by 2:00
he called and said,

168
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:01,830
so what time do you want us to go over?

169
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,940
I'd completely forgotten about it.
So I went shopping and I made,

170
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:07,740
um,
I ran out to the store.

171
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:09,120
I came back,
I made,

172
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,950
it was a long time ago,
but,

173
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,720
um,
I made roast chicken with,

174
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,040
with vinegar,
was sort of a classic French recipe,

175
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,803
some kind of potatoes,
a salad and I don't know if I made or 

176
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:27,474
bought a bread and I made chocolate 
Mousse for dessert and I did that on 

177
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:33,750
about two hours,
which for me is a lot of,

178
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,280
it's a lot of time in the kitchen for 
me.

179
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:37,680
I don't spend two hours in the kitchen 
that often is.

180
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,720
The great thing was the food was not 
that great,

181
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:42,840
but the food was fine.
The great thing was,

182
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,950
hey,
I got away with it,

183
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:46,920
and B,
they thought it was fantastic and it was

184
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:51,921
then that I realized that if you cook 
for people in your home,

185
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,350
they are,
they're looking forward to it.

186
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,870
B,
they are going to cut you so much.

187
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:58,704
Slack,
they're going to give you every benefit 

188
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:01,914
of the doubt.
They're going to be grateful and 

189
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,863
therefore the food is gonna taste better
than it would if you're in a restaurant 

190
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:09,054
where the server was annoying you and 
you knew you were going to spend a lot 

191
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:12,684
of money and you know,
you had to travel to get there and blah 

192
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:18,040
blah.
So I think it was real and that was,

193
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:23,150
that was probably 12 or 15 years ago.
So it's about halfway into my.

194
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,073
I've been cooking for 40 years,
but so it was a third of the two thirds 

195
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:30,684
of the way into my life as a cook when I
realized that you can do pretty much 

196
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,523
anything in your home if you take it 
seriously and do it as well as you can 

197
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:40,620
do it and your friends and family are 
really going to appreciate it.

198
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,493
Um,

199
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:48,843
my presence,
I guess there's other kinds of mark 

200
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:52,870
bittman meals.
Well,

201
00:10:52,871 --> 00:10:53,291
I,
you know,

202
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,450
really its simplicity.
It's honesty.

203
00:10:55,451 --> 00:10:56,284
It's,
um,

204
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,160
it's not overdoing it.
It's generally speaking,

205
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:04,840
it's very few ingredients and very 
little technique and not that much time.

206
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:07,270
And it's.
And it's home cooking.

207
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,340
It's not,
there's nothing fancy about it.

208
00:11:09,341 --> 00:11:13,810
There's no pretense.
I'd like to think there's no pretense.

209
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:14,644
I mean,
this all,

210
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,600
it sounds too good to be true.
It sounds like better than I am,

211
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:23,560
but it really is what I do.
So I guess I'll take some credit for it.

212
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,300
I think if you are a true food lover,
you are a healthy eater.

213
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,163
Well,
first of all,

214
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,340
the term Foodie is completely ridiculous
because for someone,

215
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,010
when you meet somebody and they say,
I really love to eat,

216
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,040
I think the appropriate answer is who 
doesn't?

217
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,590
So I mean,
look around,

218
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:48,191
who's,
you know,

219
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:50,440
who's not a food lover,
everybody's a food lover.

220
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,663
The question is,
do we responsibly due for your own 

221
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:55,174
benefit?
Do you eat for your planets benefit and 

222
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:58,210
the wheat,
the best food possible?

223
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,910
If the answer to all of those things is 
yes,

224
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,370
then you're eating well.
If you're eating,

225
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,130
you know if your style of eating is bad 
for your body,

226
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:08,740
if your style of eating is bad for the 
planet,

227
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,750
than you are not really eating good 
food,

228
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:12,850
you're eating lousy food and there's,
as we know,

229
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:17,851
there's plenty of lousy food around the 
principled,

230
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,510
the principled way to eat.
If you were going to say,

231
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:25,840
I want to eat entirely for my own 
benefit,

232
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,420
I want to eat entirely for the benefit 
of the planet.

233
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,283
I want to eat in the most responsible 
way possible to minimize my carbon 

234
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:36,880
footprint,
to minimize my impact overall,

235
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,050
to minimize my effect on animals.
You would be a Vegan.

236
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,303
That's the bottom line.
The veganism is the most principled way 

237
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:46,474
to eat.
That there is from the perspective of 

238
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:50,290
your own body,
from the perspective of the planet,

239
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:54,010
from the perspective of animals.
Very few people are going to be vegans.

240
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,810
Let's be real.
So,

241
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,750
um,
what's next?

242
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,643
I mean,
on the one hand you have vegans and on 

243
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:05,500
the other hand you have people who eat 
whatever they feel like eating.

244
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,203
There's a middle ground.
The problem with the way most Americans 

245
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:14,761
eat right now is that we are about as 
far from veganism as we could be,

246
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:21,511
so a vegan would get 100 percent of his 
or her calories from plants.

247
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:27,150
Most Americans get 90 percent of their 
calories from processed food,

248
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,053
junk food and animal products,
so the goal I think is to move in the 

249
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:35,344
direction of eating more unprocessed 
plant food than we do now and 

250
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:40,720
everybody's got a different starting 
place.

251
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,840
If you read 20 cheeseburgers a week or 
the equivalent,

252
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,330
you might look at eating 15 
cheeseburgers,

253
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:48,850
so weak or the equivalent.
If you're eating 15,

254
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:53,851
you might look at eating 10 and so on,
and I think if people think about what's

255
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:55,900
best for their body,
what's best for the planet,

256
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:56,763
the answer is eating unprocessed plant 
food and then think about how can I eat 

257
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,880
more of that stuff at the expense of me,
which was,

258
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,730
which was the question,
but also at the expensive processed food

259
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:10,564
and junk food.

260
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,490
The ideas deed as many unprocessed 
plants as you can.

261
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,500
What are plants,
plants or vegetables,

262
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:21,520
fruits,
legumes,

263
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:23,680
which means beans,
nuts and seeds.

264
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,650
Um,
what am I leaving out?

265
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,343
I think that's about it.
So the idea is to eat as many 

266
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:32,164
unprocessed plants as you possibly can 
and to eat those instead of eating 

267
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,750
processed foods,
junk foods and animal products.

268
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,793
But works for me.
What's worked for me for just about 

269
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:48,940
three years now.
What works for me is to eat very,

270
00:14:48,941 --> 00:14:49,774
very strict diet of plants only and 
unprocessed plants only from the time I 

271
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:55,610
wake up in the morning until dinner 
time.

272
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:59,450
So from the time I wake up until roughly
dark,

273
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,470
I eat a lot of fruit.
I eat a lot of vegetables,

274
00:15:02,471 --> 00:15:03,304
I eat some whole grains and sometimes I 
have some beans and that's pretty much 

275
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:09,830
it.
And then at night I eat whatever I want.

276
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,933
And that's the which includes meeting,
which includes wine and which includes 

277
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:18,560
pasta and bread and stuff like that.
That's a huge change for me.

278
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:21,400
I think that if you think of your diet 
as a seesaw with the,

279
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,810
you know,
the animal products,

280
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:24,644
the process with the junk food on the 
heavy side as it is for most people and 

281
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:30,860
the unprocessed plants on the light side
as it is for most people.

282
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,933
I think for me,
my seesaw went from looking something 

283
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:36,380
like this to looking something like 
this.

284
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,380
I think that to the extent other people 
can eat that way,

285
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:44,360
they will have a have a lesser impact on
the planet,

286
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,210
improve their health,
probably lose weight,

287
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,313
feel better.

288
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,560
Think I just decided to change the way 
because of some of the things we've been

289
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:58,394
talking about here.
One is that I recognize that I'm one of 

290
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:04,934
the highest contributors to greenhouse 
gases and global warming is the is the 

291
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,940
industrial production of livestock,
so I decided,

292
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:11,774
okay,
that was one good reason to eat less 

293
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:13,844
meat.
The other good reasons he lifts me is 

294
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:19,070
that I was in my mid fifties and my 
health wasn't what it used to be,

295
00:16:19,071 --> 00:16:21,290
so I was overweight.
I had bad knees,

296
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,640
I had sleep apnea,
I had high cholesterol,

297
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,340
I had high blood sugar or borderline 
high blood sugar.

298
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,650
I think that's enough.
So,

299
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:35,651
um,
I decided to change my diet and it's,

300
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,703
it's so obvious to everyone who pays any
attention to nutrition at all that if 

301
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:44,180
you want to be healthier,
the way to do that is,

302
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,530
you know,
as I've already said,

303
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:49,580
is to eat fewer animal products than eat
less processed and junk foods.

304
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,520
So I started to do that and,
and it worked.

305
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:56,750
I lost 35 pounds,
gained five of them back,

306
00:16:56,751 --> 00:17:00,650
but hey,
a slept sleep apnea went away.

307
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:03,260
I slept better,
my knees bothered me much less.

308
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:05,390
In fact,
I ran the New York marathon last year,

309
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,733
um,
my cholesterol is back to normal and my 

310
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:10,040
blood sugars back to normal.
So it all worked.

311
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,990
And it's not a coincidence.
I mean,

312
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,440
no one would say it was a coincidence,
actually not.

313
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,990
Um,
there's some things I don't like,

314
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,520
but I think that it's important to 
recognize that there's no sort of single

315
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,403
arsenic and cyanide aside,
there's not really a single ingredient 

316
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:32,750
that's going to outright kill you.
I mean,

317
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:36,920
there's actually some evidence that a 
single can of soda can trigger diabetes,

318
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:40,610
but there's not a lot of eps evidence 
about that in general.

319
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,240
One ingredient,
one little kinds of food,

320
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,580
one,
one meal,

321
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,443
one day,
even one week that's not what's 

322
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,230
determinant of your overall health or of
your impact on the planet.

323
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,310
What determines is your overall diet and
if it's moving in the right direction,

324
00:17:56,311 --> 00:18:01,200
which for most Americans is towards 
plants and away from animal products and

325
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:03,180
processed foods,
then I think,

326
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:03,871
you know,
hip,

327
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:04,580
hip,
hooray,

328
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,090
you know,
that's the way to go.

329
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,180
Yeah.
There is a great vegan chef.

330
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:13,014
Um,
I mean there were a few at this point 

331
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,600
and um,
yeah,

332
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,750
I,
I think that it's,

333
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,690
you know,
actually this is an interesting story.

334
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,630
I met a Vegan chef from Japan a couple 
of years ago,

335
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,090
tiny tiny woman.
Um,

336
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:33,230
really interesting and a,
and not a Vegan in her personal life,

337
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,130
but she was a Vegan chef.
She ran it small,

338
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:41,090
maybe 12 or 20 seat restaurant in Tokyo.
Um,

339
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,373
and everything was strictly Vegan.
And when I found that she wasn't a 

340
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,300
Vegan,
um,

341
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,140
I said,
I don't get this.

342
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:50,480
I mean,
why would you choose to,

343
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,690
it's not a matter of principle for you 
because you eat meat,

344
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:54,524
you eat fish.
Why would you choose to narrow what you 

345
00:18:58,401 --> 00:19:00,380
serve your customers when you're 
yourself?

346
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,590
Eat from the broadest spectrum possible.
And she said,

347
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,383
it's like pen and ink.
There are people who choose to be 

348
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,133
artists and only pen and ink because 
they want to narrow the world in which 

349
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,090
they're looking at,
so as to more fully explore it.

350
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,223
And I want to narrow the world in which 
I'm cooking so I can understand that 

351
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,690
better.
And she was an amazing,

352
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:25,100
amazing chef.
She made great,

353
00:19:25,101 --> 00:19:25,934
great stuff.

354
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:30,821
I,
you know,

355
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:33,670
I'd,
I'd be guessing to answer that question.

356
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:38,230
And um,
it's a confluence of a bunch of things.

357
00:19:38,231 --> 00:19:42,320
I mean,
first off I guess is that we,

358
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,080
we like fads.
I mean,

359
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:46,450
we like trends,
so here's the one that hadn't been fully

360
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,280
exploited.
Secondly,

361
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:53,170
food television really had,
has had a huge impact.

362
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:57,520
I mean cooking and eating as a spectator
sport never before in history.

363
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,040
So that's had a huge impact.
Third,

364
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:04,600
I think is the kind of 
internationalization of food people,

365
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:08,500
not only people traveling and seeing 
food from the rest of the world,

366
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:09,334
but ingredients and types of cuisines 
and restaurants arriving here in 

367
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:15,520
unprecedented numbers.
So I think,

368
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,130
you know,
I guess the short answer is exposure,

369
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:21,820
but it still doesn't explain.
It doesn't explain.

370
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,960
You're going to walk into a party and 
having someone come up to you and say,

371
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:30,640
I'm a foodie and there's something about
the sort of trendiness.

372
00:20:30,641 --> 00:20:31,810
It's like saying,

373
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,300
you know,
I'm a closed person.

374
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:35,991
Well,
yeah,

375
00:20:35,991 --> 00:20:38,090
we all wear clothes.
I'm a closed person.

376
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:42,360
The thing that makes me most upset about
this big fat is that more people are not

377
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,580
cooking.
And that,

378
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,463
um,
I think it's fine to watch other people 

379
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:48,310
cook,
but then people say,

380
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:49,540
well,
I'm too busy to cook.

381
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,403
And they're too busy to cook because 
they're watching people cook on 

382
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:54,280
television.
It doesn't track for me.

383
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:55,870
I think it's really,
really bad.

384
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,320
Now the one is real and what is not is 
really,

385
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,710
really difficult.
That I,

386
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,553
I,
I,

387
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,210
I can't,
I can't answer that.

388
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,520
I don't.
I don't know what's real and what's not.

389
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:14,350
One has to hope that things that are 
certified organic are organic,

390
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,430
but what does organic mean?
It's a,

391
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,410
it's a term that's defined by the United
States Department of Agriculture.

392
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,543
It doesn't mean anything or it doesn't 
mean much about how the animals are 

393
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:25,030
treated.

394
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,863
It doesn't really mean much about what 
kind or what breed of the animals there 

395
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:31,360
are.
It doesn't mean anything in terms of how

396
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,823
the workers who were raising these 
animals or farming these crops are 

397
00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:41,200
treated doesn't mean anything about 
where the food is from.

398
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,920
So does organic have some meaning?
Yes.

399
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:46,810
I think the term organic has some 
meeting,

400
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,080
but I think that it's not the most 
important thing.

401
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:54,420
I won't go so far as to say that it's a 
red herring because I think it's.

402
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,470
There are some important things about 
it,

403
00:21:56,471 --> 00:22:01,030
but I will say this,
the most important division in our style

404
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:01,864
of eating right now is not organic 
versus non organic and it's not local 

405
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:09,760
versus non local.
It's plants versus anything else and you

406
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:10,594
know,
I don't,

407
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,530
I don't mean to be repetitive,
but the message to me,

408
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:16,090
the message is very,
very clear.

409
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,950
The way that people can eat best is to 
eat less crap,

410
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,873
to put it bluntly and crap is processed 
food and junk food and you can have 

411
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:30,691
organic process food and you can have 
organic junk food and that food is.

412
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,440
Maybe it's a little better than 
nonorganic process than junk food,

413
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,820
but it's not good food and that's the 
most important lesson we can learn.

414
00:22:39,821 --> 00:22:40,654
I think.

415
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,403
Well,
I,

416
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,110
again,
I think the clear answer is that,

417
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,530
um,
as far as your body is concerned,

418
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:57,550
a grape from Chile is better than a 
cheeseburger from around the corner.

419
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,270
If you're willing to eat turnips,
carrots,

420
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,520
a bread,
you bake yourself frozen meat,

421
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,360
a very limited diet.
You can eat locally almost anywhere,

422
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:13,120
at least in this country all year round.
And that's great,

423
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:13,954
but it's expensive.
It's inconvenient than it takes 

424
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:16,234
dedication.
I think it's a swell idea and I think 

425
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:22,150
that ultimately for food to make sense 
in this country,

426
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,273
I think we're going to see more 
regionalism and less food coming out of 

427
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,114
California,
but I don't think we'll ever be at a 

428
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:34,120
place where we see no food coming out of
California unless it falls into the sea.

429
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,440
Of course.
Um,

430
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,780
and I,
and I think that if you're,

431
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,060
if you want to be truly a local,
either,

432
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:41,200
you're not going to be drinking.

433
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,880
If you're living in the northeast as I 
do,

434
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:44,470
you're not going to be drinking any 
coffee.

435
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,940
You're not going to be drinking any 
caffeinated tea.

436
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,250
You're not going to be using any olive 
oil.

437
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,180
There are a lot of things you're just 
going to be missing out on.

438
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,433
That's fine.
If you think that that's the highest 

439
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:59,240
priority.
There are other priorities.

440
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:00,200
I think I,
I,

441
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,840
I'm a fan of local food.
I really like local food.

442
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:06,980
But to go back to the discussion of 
trendiness in food,

443
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,280
everything need not be taken to an 
extreme.

444
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:13,580
And this is another thing that's being 
has been taken to an extreme,

445
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,853
if you know,
if I'm driving say six hours and I 

446
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:25,670
decided to stop at Wendy's or whatever,
I guess there's a twinge of guilt,

447
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,530
but there's also an excuse because 
you're away and you know,

448
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,150
you're busy and blah,
blah blah.

449
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,880
And I don't exercise that excuse very 
often.

450
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:35,714
So I don't really feel guilty about.
I think what would make me feel guilty 

451
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,823
and I don't do it,
is I'm going to the supermarket and 

452
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:46,850
buying a huge bag of potato chips and 
coming home and eating it,

453
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:52,180
but I don't do it.
So why do they choose?

454
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,943
Because they want something comfortable.
They want something they're familiar 

455
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:58,640
with.
They all want bacon and eggs,

456
00:24:58,641 --> 00:24:59,151
right?
I mean,

457
00:24:59,151 --> 00:25:00,590
I don't.
That's my guests.

458
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:01,424
Everybody wants for Friday eggs and 
butter with unlimited supply of Bacon 

459
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,040
and really,
really great toast.

460
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,220
Um,
I would.

461
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,540
Am I being executed?
I have to get the scenarios.

462
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:20,360
Assuming I'm being executed and I have,
it's not a last meal.

463
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,710
Like I don't want to think about cancer 
last meals.

464
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:26,690
I want to think about execution last 
meals.

465
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,520
I would call,
you know,

466
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:29,840
I'm privileged,
I can do this.

467
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:30,674
I would call my friend John George 
vongerichten and tell him I want him to 

468
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:37,340
cook for me until I tell them to stop.
That would be my last meal,

469
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,780
but I do like the four or six eggs 
cooked in a lot of butter with bacon and

470
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,120
really good toast.
I like that too.

471
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:52,990
I think it's more authentic.
I think that the problem with salt too,

472
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,210
to the extent that there is a problem 
with salt and this is not really,

473
00:25:56,211 --> 00:25:57,044
really clear,
but to the extent that there is a 

474
00:25:58,221 --> 00:26:00,770
promise,
it's the salt and processed foods.

475
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:04,040
People who don't eat a lot of processed 
foods don't have problems with salt.

476
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:08,630
People who add their own salt to food 
have no problems with salt.

477
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,733
Chefs who make their own chefs in 
restaurants who cooked from scratch and 

478
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:13,904
add salt to their taste or to the 
perceived taste of their diners are not 

479
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:18,734
adding criminal amounts of salt.
If you want to limit the amount of salt 

480
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:25,040
mix dot McDonald's puts in it's 
processed foods,

481
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,143
that's great.
I'd like to limit the amount of food 

482
00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:29,240
they can sell,
period.

483
00:26:29,241 --> 00:26:32,600
It's not really a salt problem.
It's an overall food problem.

484
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,990
Well,
I think it is happening,

485
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:41,340
which is really amazing that the,
um,

486
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,730
the mayor of Philadelphia just proposed 
a very,

487
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,253
the,
the proponents of a soda tax or 

488
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:50,220
generally proposing a penny per ounce as
an excise tax,

489
00:26:50,221 --> 00:26:51,054
which means 12 ounce can of soda might 
cost the dollar 12 instead of a dollar 

490
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,483
and at a 24 pack case of Soda Might 
Cross my double in price from a sale 

491
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:08,730
price of two 99 or three 99.
That's really incredible.

492
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:10,830
The guy in Philadelphia,
I think his name is nutter,

493
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,353
but it's his name.
The guy in Philadelphia is proposing to 

494
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:18,960
cents per ounce,
which is really quite amazing because it

495
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:22,410
means a dollar can of soda would cross 
the dollar and a quarter,

496
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,890
a 32 ounce bottle of soda.
That was a dollar.

497
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:29,790
It costs a dollar 32 and oh no,
a dollar 64 and so on.

498
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:32,010
So I think it is happening.

499
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,113
Why is it important?
Soda is the leading source of calories 

500
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:38,064
for Americans.
Americans get seven percent of their 

501
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:40,464
calories from soda,
which is more than they get from any 

502
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:44,880
other single food,
and let's think about this.

503
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:45,923
It's non-nutritive.
That is to say it has no benefit 

504
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,430
whatsoever.
None like it's not harmless,

505
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,740
it's negative.
Secondly,

506
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,190
it's a leading causes of obesity in the 
United States.

507
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:00,024
I mean if obesity is a problem,
you have to look at where the calories 

508
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:03,834
are coming from.
If soda is the number one source of 

509
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:06,384
calories in the United States and it's 
not a beneficial sources of calories is 

510
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:11,604
something people can do with that.
So if you're obese and you're looking 

511
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:14,514
for ways to help people figure out what 
they can do without soda is a very good 

512
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:19,194
start.
So I think the tax is a very smart 

513
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:21,714
thing.
There's some research that shows that 

514
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:26,190
taxing junk food,
which thought is a junk food tax,

515
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:29,370
taxing junk food is more likely to help 
people eat well.

516
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,413
Then subsidizing healthy food.
The irony is that if you subsidize 

517
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:33,804
healthy food,
people will take the money they're 

518
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:37,350
saving and buy junk food,
which is sad but true.

519
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,640
I think the soda tax makes sense.
I think it's happening,

520
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:44,910
I think it's going to happen this year 
and next year I think it's going to be a

521
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:45,744
swell of soda taxes and I think once the
greedy state legislatures realized they 

522
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:53,760
can make money on this thing,
it's going to have even more momentum.

523
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,973
I moved this year and I moved from a 
kitchen that was six by seven to a 

524
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:03,930
kitchen.
There was a bad eight by eight,

525
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:07,770
so it's an eight by eight.
Maybe it's seven by seven.

526
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,630
It's 50 something square feet.
Uh,

527
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,810
it has counselors on two sides.
It has a refrigerator on a third side,

528
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:18,330
has drawers on the fourth side and it 
has two doors.

529
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:19,603
It has a sink and dishwasher and a stove
and it has maybe six feet of counter 

530
00:29:23,941 --> 00:29:28,941
space and nothing is fancy,
but it's for me nearly perfect.

531
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:32,280
I mean,
I wish I could fit more,

532
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,400
like I wish I could fit a table in it 
and I wish I could fit more people in it

533
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,430
to hang out with while I was cooking.
But um,

534
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,860
it's,
it's pretty great.

535
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,783
It's really nice,
but there's nothing that was nothing 

536
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:49,981
unusual or remarkable about it.
Um,

537
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,480
this goes back to something I was 
talking about before.

538
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,210
The way that recipes happened for me is

539
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,250
shopping.
It all starts with shopping.

540
00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:03,320
So I will go.
I go to China town a lot,

541
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:04,843
I go to a decent supermarkets,
I go to green markets and I try to buy 

542
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:14,180
everything that looks good that I think 
I can cook in the next x days.

543
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,150
Am I cooking at home for the next four 
days?

544
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,250
Because to be home for four days in a 
row is a lot.

545
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,043
I'll buy four days of food,
but I'll buy a lot and then I will go 

546
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:25,964
home and I will cook what I bought and 
almost always a because I have no 

547
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:37,670
patience with cooking from recipes be 
because I'm not that methodical.

548
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,800
See,
because I have a bad memory.

549
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:42,740
I always think I'm making things up.
I can't even do that.

550
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:43,574
Implicate my own recipes.
What happens is there's this house full 

551
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:49,340
of food and I started cooking in usually
interesting things happened.

552
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:50,174
I don't know.

553
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,220
Brilliant things don't happen,
but interesting things happen.

554
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:56,110
Interesting enough to write about.
Evidently,

555
00:30:56,111 --> 00:31:01,111
since people read this stuff,
well I don't really care.

556
00:31:03,681 --> 00:31:04,130
Um,
you know,

557
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,200
if you substitute one,
and if you,

558
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:10,970
if you are making pasta with Broccoli 
and you don't have Broccoli,

559
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,220
you want to make pasta with quality 
flour.

560
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,070
Everything about that is the same.
The cooking time,

561
00:31:16,071 --> 00:31:16,904
the technique,
just about everything about it is the 

562
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:19,004
same.
Assuming you know how to Trim Broccoli 

563
00:31:21,231 --> 00:31:24,230
and trim quality flour.
Is it a different recipe?

564
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,720
You might say it's a different recipe.
Um,

565
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,440
but almost everything about it is the 
same and so wide.

566
00:31:30,441 --> 00:31:32,150
If it's a different recipe,
recipes still good.

567
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,013
I mean,
I like to say you can vary things as 

568
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:36,944
much as you want to,
but you have to remember that you can't 

569
00:31:38,421 --> 00:31:40,070
make a roast chicken without chicken.

570
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,240
It's a toss up.
My wife is the greatest dining companion

571
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:54,100
and um,
you know,

572
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,750
a total joy to cook for and she's a good
eater and really have fun together.

573
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:03,751
But I have to say that my kids who grew 
up eating my food and can call and say,

574
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,673
I'm coming over,
could you make something Asian or I'm 

575
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:09,520
coming over,
I need this pasta dish,

576
00:32:09,521 --> 00:32:12,610
or I'm coming over and could you just,
could we have one of those?

577
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,493
You know,
I,

578
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,850
it's really nice.
I mean like they're grown.

579
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,710
There's a lot of history there and it's 
really special to cook for that.

580
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,710
I don't want to have to convince anybody
that what I'm making is good.

581
00:32:24,711 --> 00:32:26,660
I know it's good.
I usually enjoy it.

582
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,960
If someone enjoys eating,
they'll enjoy eating this stuff.

583
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:31,880
I cook.
If they don't,

584
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,800
something's wrong somewhere.
You know,

585
00:32:33,801 --> 00:32:35,710
there's not,
you know,

586
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,673
Julia child used to say,
the great thing about is you get to eat 

587
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:40,790
your mistakes.

588
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,013
The thing is that if you take care and 
cooking and if you know what you're 

589
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:48,590
doing even a little bit,
unless you burn something,

590
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,060
there are very few things that wind up 
so bad that you can enjoy them.

591
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,140
Very few.
So,

592
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,860
I mean,
and I,

593
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,000
I,
you know,

594
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:57,980
I'm,
I'm lucky enough to have been doing this

595
00:32:57,981 --> 00:32:58,814
long enough and writing about it and 
learning from other people and thinking 

596
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:02,054
about it so that generally speaking,
the stuff I do is pretty good and the 

597
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:08,420
people I cook for tend to enjoy it.
But I said before,

598
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:09,860
it's not,
it's not brilliant.

599
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,020
It's not earth shattering,
it's just good food.

600
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,333
No,
Maria and I have known each other 

601
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,853
probably 10 years and we've gotten 
increasingly busy so we don't see each 

602
00:33:22,511 --> 00:33:23,344
other that much.
So it was really a treat to hang out so 

603
00:33:25,811 --> 00:33:27,040
much.
And I'm,

604
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,000
I,
I know from my,

605
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,920
the people who I was going to say my 
fans,

606
00:33:32,921 --> 00:33:34,300
which I guess is right,
but anyway,

607
00:33:34,301 --> 00:33:35,134
I know from people who've watched 
spending on the road again and my other 

608
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:39,780
TV shows that,
um,

609
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:40,743
everybody thinks that TV is the most fun
thing in the world and everybody's 

610
00:33:43,931 --> 00:33:46,360
completely jealous of,

611
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,413
well,
well you got to hang out with Mario and 

612
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:50,204
Gwyneth and this has that beautiful 
woman and the food and Spain must be so 

613
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:53,624
amazing.
And the fact that television is a 

614
00:33:55,281 --> 00:33:56,114
tremendous amount of work and for every 
minute on screen there's an hour of 

615
00:34:01,851 --> 00:34:02,684
work,
so for every 60 minutes on screen 

616
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,830
there's a week of work and it really is 
like that.

617
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:07,664
So we did huge amount of driving and 
there's a lot of setup time and not 

618
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:14,210
exactly rehearsal,
but figuring out what we're going to do.

619
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,333
So none of that was my favorite part.
My favorite part was nighttime when 

620
00:34:19,611 --> 00:34:21,710
everything was done and we all got drunk
together.

621
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:22,544
So that was really great.
And Mario's Mario of course can drink 

622
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:29,870
anyone under the table.
I think he'll admit to this.

623
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,500
I mean it's not an admission.
I think he'll be proud of this.

624
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,900
Whereas I can't drink anyway under the 
table.

625
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,360
Plus I go to bed earlier than anybody 
else.

626
00:34:38,361 --> 00:34:43,361
I go to bed earlier than anybody.
So we'd finished the shoot.

627
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,090
We'd have a bite to eat,
we'd have a fair amount of wine.

628
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,490
It would be 9:30,
10:30,

629
00:34:49,491 --> 00:34:51,260
1130.
I'd go to bed.

630
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,390
Mario will be up until four in the 
morning.

631
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:57,020
Everyone else was waking up with black 
eyes and broken shoulders.

632
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,660
He was always in great shape,
so that was sort of fun.

633
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:04,650
It was like,
so I could say,

634
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,563
um,
I would cook for Adolf Hitler and 

635
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:09,750
surfing poison.
I could say that.

636
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,530
Um,
I could say quite sincerely.

637
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,203
Um,

638
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,933
see,
I don't think you can influence people 

639
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:19,621
really.
I mean,

640
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:20,370
I,
you know,

641
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,860
the obvious answer and obvious answers I
will.

642
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:26,970
I would cook for President Obama and set
him straight on a number of issues,

643
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:29,100
but he's already got a lot of people 
setting them straight.

644
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,580
I think the people I'd most like to cook
for,

645
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:36,180
um,
would it be my maternal grandparents who

646
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:37,014
I loved very much had been dead a long 
time and who I think in some ways we're 

647
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:46,491
responsible a lot for my personality,
for the way I handle myself and also for

648
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:48,174
my love of food and saying that makes me
think I should go cook for my parents 

649
00:35:52,321 --> 00:35:55,440
more often than I do.
They're alive fortunately.

650
00:35:55,441 --> 00:36:00,441
So I'm going to look on well Foodie,
uh,

651
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,680
we should be hearing less about people 
being foodies.

652
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:07,883
Um,
I guess I have to turn that question 

653
00:36:11,151 --> 00:36:11,984
around and say I just,
I just really wish that people would 

654
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,710
take more responsibility for their own 
food.

655
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,500
I wish people would buy their own food 
and cook their own food.

656
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,770
Increasingly,
I don't wish restaurants didn't exist.

657
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,730
I wish that people didn't eat 50 percent
of their meals outside of the home.

658
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,250
I wish they had 10 percent of their 
meals outside of the home.

659
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,413
That would be the most positive trend 
that could possibly happen in food in 

660
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:34,820
the United States.
And when I say eating at home,

661
00:36:34,821 --> 00:36:39,320
I don't mean going to the supermarket 
buying some pre prepared food and eating

662
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:40,154
it at home and I don't mean by microwave
food and reheating it and home and I 

663
00:36:43,611 --> 00:36:47,750
don't mean calling for pizza or take out
and eating at home and cooking.

664
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,913
And if people cooked 50 percent of their
meals as opposed to what's probably 20 

665
00:36:54,051 --> 00:36:56,010
percent of their sales people really 
cook,

666
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:56,844
60 percent of the meals there would be a
huge impact on both their health and on 

667
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,310
the environment and it would be almost 
entirely positive.

668
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,610
That's really my most fervent wish.
