1
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,950
There is a lot of water on Mars and
there once was a lot of surface flowing

2
00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:11,690
water.
You don't,

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,180
uh,
you don't see it because it's,

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,860
most of it is mixed with the soil which
we call regolith on Mars.

5
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:23,861
So the Martian soil can be anywhere from
as little as one percent in some very

6
00:00:24,141 --> 00:00:27,560
dry desert,
like areas to as much as 60 percent

7
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,400
water.
One strategy for getting water when

8
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:34,160
you're on Mars is to break up the
regolith,

9
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:37,520
which would take something like a Jack
Hammer because it's very cold.

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,550
It's very frozen.
If you can imagine making a frozen brick

11
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:47,870
or a chunk of ice that's mostly soil and
maybe half water and half soil,

12
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:51,290
that's what you would be dealing with.
So you need to break this up,

13
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,410
put it in an oven.
As it heats up,

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,470
it turns to steam your,
run it through a distillation to,

15
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,940
and you have pure drinking.

16
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,570
Water comes out the other end.
There is a much easier way to get water

17
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:03,780
on Mars.
Um,

18
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,600
in this country we have developed
industrial dehumidifiers.

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,100
Um,
and there's a very simple machines that

20
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:18,101
simply blow the air in a room or a
building across a mineral called zoo

21
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:20,330
lights.
Zeolite is very common on earth that's

22
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:24,020
very common on Mars and Zeolite is Kinda
like a sponge.

23
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:27,500
It absorbs water like crazy.
It takes the humidity right out of the

24
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:31,400
air,
then you squeeze it and outcomes the

25
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:35,960
water.
And scientists working for NASA at the

26
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,440
University of Washington as long ago as
19 in the 19,

27
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,070
late 19 nineties,
developed a machine called a waiver that

28
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:46,190
very efficiently sucks water out of the
Martian atmosphere.

29
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,960
So water is not nearly significant
problem that appears to be.

30
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:55,220
We also know from orbiters around Mars
and right now there are five satellites

31
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:58,340
orbiting Mars.
We know from photographs that these

32
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:02,990
orbiters have taken,
and I'm a geological studies that

33
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:06,830
they've done that.
There is frozen ice on the surface of

34
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:07,251
Mars.
Now.

35
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:12,240
There's tons of it at the polls.
Some of it is overladen with frozen or

36
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,440
mixed with frozen carbon dioxide.
But in many craters on Mars,

37
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,530
there apparently are sheets of frozen
water.

38
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,950
So if early astronauts are early
voyagers tomorrow's where to land near

39
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:31,590
one of those sheets of ice in a crater,
um,

40
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,230
they would have all the water they need.
