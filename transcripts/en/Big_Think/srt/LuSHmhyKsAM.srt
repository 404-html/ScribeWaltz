1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,100
Quit your job and go start it.
Yes,

2
00:00:03,101 --> 00:00:05,260
there are characteristics for people who
are good at entrepreneurs.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,700
They quit their job and they go start
it.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,340
I'm gonna sit next to a lovely woman
wants.

5
00:00:09,341 --> 00:00:11,740
And uh,
she had a fantastic idea for a,

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,450
for a company and said,
well,

7
00:00:13,451 --> 00:00:15,070
how long have you been designing it?
And,

8
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:16,090
and whatnot.
She said,

9
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:17,680
18 months and said,
well look,

10
00:00:17,681 --> 00:00:19,090
I'll give you a bit of bit of advice.
You know,

11
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:19,660
like,
yeah,

12
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,790
put down your fork and knife.
We've breakfast,

13
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,740
go to your office,
lock the door,

14
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:26,530
throw your three colleagues.
Nobody's allowed to leave the room.

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,390
You have to order in pizza and beer and
soda and whatever else it is until you

16
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:34,540
finish the product and its life.
If you don't do that,

17
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,400
you will never be successful.
If you do it,

18
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,370
you have a shot,
right?

19
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,980
And you have a shot to fail,
which is,

20
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:39,814
you know,
that's a,

21
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,240
that's a better starting point than
never even having a shot to,

22
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:43,961
uh,
uh,

23
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:44,910
to fail.
Uh,

24
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,180
so she didn't do it.
Somebody else along,

25
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,710
a couple of other companies launch the
same product.

26
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,870
She actually never got out the out the
door.

27
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,620
So if you want to be an entrepreneur,
quit your job right now.

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,380
Shut down this browser after you
patronize big things,

29
00:00:56,381 --> 00:01:00,250
advertisers first and go start it now.

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,900
Why you still looking at me?
Go start it now.
