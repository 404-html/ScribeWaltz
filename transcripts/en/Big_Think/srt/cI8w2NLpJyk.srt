1
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:08,860
Yes,
I think there are,

2
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:10,450
I think are four is the obvious

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,600
placed.
Um,

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:16,760
and what's important to understand is it
doesn't require the United States.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,920
Um,
the Viet Mommy's army stopped the

6
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:26,060
killing in Cambodia.
The Indian army stopped the killing in

7
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:28,610
east Pakistan,
which became Bangladesh.

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,880
The Tanzanian army shutdown the
murderous regime of Idi Amin in Uganda.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,040
Um,
there was a UN force of 5,000 soldiers

10
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,070
in Rwanda when the killing began and the
commander of that force told the

11
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:50,420
secretary general,
I can stop this with 5,000 soldiers who

12
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:53,630
did not have all of the high tech stuff
that American,

13
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,700
the American army deploys.
Um,

14
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,850
humanitarian intervention can be,
you can,

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,780
you can work with a division of labor,
doesn't have to be the United States.

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,630
Um,
other regional associations,

17
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,780
other,
other countries can,

18
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:16,130
can do this work.
And we should sometimes provide

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,130
political support.
We should sometimes provide logistical

20
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:21,230
or financial support.
Um,

21
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,270
but it doesn't have to be American
troops.

22
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,510
And clearly in the Sudan we cannot
invade another Muslim country.

23
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,800
We are in no position morally or
politically to do that.

24
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,200
So it would have to be somebody else who
went into.
