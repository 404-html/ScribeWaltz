1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,740
Yeah,

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,230
well having been part of a military
during the time of a draft and then

3
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:21,510
having been part of the defense
establishment when the all volunteer

4
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:23,150
force was,
was coming in,

5
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,170
there's no question in my mind the AVF
is head and shoulders above a draft.

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,660
Uh,
these young men and women are fantastic.

7
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:34,860
I don't know if I'd have been worthy of
them as a young officer there that good.

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,440
Uh,
but we're on the sec just starting the

9
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:39,480
second generation of the all volunteer
force.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,380
This is going to be very interesting
experience and I don't know how it's

11
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:48,381
going to going to come out.
Clearly having an all volunteer force is

12
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:52,200
one of the things that has kept public
scrutiny of the war,

13
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,910
uh,
down,

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,810
uh,
somewhat.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,400
Uh,
I do think having said that,

16
00:00:57,401 --> 00:01:01,380
that there is a place in our society for
sort of mandatory service,

17
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:06,381
not necessarily military service because
I think it's a good thing to give to the

18
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:10,620
country and I think it's a good leveler.
A people of all religions,

19
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:15,210
races and creeds can come together and
sacrificed together and give back to

20
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:17,400
this country for a year or two.
Uh,

21
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:20,940
I think that'd be a great thing,
but I don't foresee a return to the

22
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:25,941
draft as being a desirable possible
unless we were faced with a major

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,713
catastrophe.

24
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,061
Oh,
I,

25
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:32,930
I,
I encourage them to do it.

26
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,810
I'd be very enthusiastic about it.
Uh,

27
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:37,430
as I say it is,
uh,

28
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,280
the young men and women who go,
they find that they're part of something

29
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:44,210
bigger than themselves and uh,
I think this makes them on the one hand

30
00:01:44,211 --> 00:01:45,740
feel that they're part of something
worthwhile,

31
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,380
but on the other hand realize,
uh,

32
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:51,630
that we're all part of something larger,
uh,

33
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,550
and that when you see that you can do
your part within that context,

34
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,770
I think it makes you a better citizen
all around.

35
00:01:57,771 --> 00:02:00,370
I think it shapes you very well for a
future workforce.
