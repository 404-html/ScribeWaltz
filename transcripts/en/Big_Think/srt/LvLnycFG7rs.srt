1
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,070
My inner revolution book.
Yeah.

2
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:12,550
I still think that definitely,
but we're just subverted that we're,

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,110
we're under the control of warmongers.
That's a moment of war criminals.

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,890
They are controlling us and taking all
the money and taking all their energy

5
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:23,050
and had,
they've controlled the media propaganda

6
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:26,980
vehicle and so on.
They've turned it into basically and uh,

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,080
so,
but,

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,080
but they are kind of desperate though
because they had been had but they're

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,620
not getting anywhere and the people are
getting more and more sick of it and

10
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:38,390
the,
and the people are,

11
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,190
have been for fooled into it and
frightened into it in various ways.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,050
But I think that's kind of,
it's like it's the darkness before the

13
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:47,620
Dawn.
They,

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,980
I think the people will really refuse at
some point at this rate,

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,610
you know,
because um,

16
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,910
you know,
the Cold War and they were kind of happy

17
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:57,940
in the Cold War,
these criminal people because they had a

18
00:00:57,941 --> 00:01:00,460
big enemy that they could promote that
they were afraid of.

19
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:03,310
They were very unhappy at the end of
World War II because we won.

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,790
So therefore they was no need to always
in American history before that.

21
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,110
As Gore Vidal brilliantly says,
we always demobilized,

22
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,270
but in 47 truman and others decided that
they would create this enemy and the

23
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:19,900
Russians are former great allies who
helped us beat the Germans.

24
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:21,820
Actually in the Italian was really good
Russian,

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,230
we're a major factor and they were our
major allies and suddenly it turned them

26
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:30,220
into the devil and the a threatened them
with nuke our nuclear weapons,

27
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,800
which then caused them to like build up
nuclear.

28
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,150
Then we could have an arms race for
them.

29
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:37,120
Then make them an enemy.
Then have all these proxy wars and the

30
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:40,420
happy days for the military have 40
years of cold war.

31
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,450
Then finally it stopped and they didn't
know what to do.

32
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,380
They're doing Bush one no more cold war,
no more things.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,330
They,
even Bush one had the temerity,

34
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,410
the old warrior,
a CIA guy that he is to say we might

35
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:57,880
have a peace dividend and he's talking
there to all the poor people in America,

36
00:01:57,881 --> 00:02:01,450
all the people with no decent roads and
schools and train systems and all the

37
00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:05,140
horrible way deteriorate it
infrastructure that the u s now is a

38
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:07,270
victim of like a fourth world country.

39
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,280
And,
but no,

40
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:12,580
there's no peace dividend because the
old secretary of defense,

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,050
you know,
Darth Cheney writes up a big program for

42
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:20,500
world conquest.
And so everybody's our enemy.

43
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:21,880
Sadly then.
So it's even better.

44
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:25,450
We only had the Russians before and now
suddenly everybody is our enemy.

45
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,870
And then it's got to find some people,
okay,

46
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:31,540
let attack Iraq little attacks here and
there and we'll conquer from Iraq to

47
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,110
central Russia,
you know,

48
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,180
and get all the oil.
You know,

49
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,910
I mean,
it's ridiculous thing he wrote in 1991

50
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:39,520
which they'd been doing now in 2000 with
the poor,

51
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,670
the poorest son who was just a party
animal who just,

52
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:44,440
you know,
wants to sniff coke and have fun.

53
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,100
And they just put him up there and he's
like going like this and they don't

54
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,460
here's know what he's doing.
And he's leading the charge of these

55
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:56,170
complete World War II lunatics who are
criminals really basically themselves,

56
00:02:56,171 --> 00:02:57,070
their war criminals.

57
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,310
But my point is that that the
incompetence of their way of going about

58
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:08,311
it shows how desperate they are because
the system that they sit astride of is

59
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:11,620
no longer functional.
Do you know what I mean?

60
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,870
It a hundred years ago,
200 years ago in the time of imperialism

61
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,960
cleansing and you could win a war,
and that's defined by von Clausewitz

62
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,160
wage,
the war theorists as meaning you now

63
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,460
don't just beat the enemy's army.
You then make the enemies population do

64
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:26,950
what you want,
and you have a colonial empire and they

65
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:30,430
produce goods for you and they do things
for you because then you can subdue

66
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:32,770
them.
But nobody can seem to anybody now.

67
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,390
They just don't get subdued.
Even so much,

68
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,850
you guys,
we saw that and be numb,

69
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,540
but you guys wearing silk,
black little pajamas running around in

70
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,360
pajamas kicked us right out of their
country.

71
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,400
We were,
people were falling off the side of

72
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:48,940
ships in Da Nang harbor,
falling off helicopters and stuff.

73
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,470
Bunch of guys in pajamas.
