1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,400
Well,
partly

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,140
this is what I know and I,
it's something,

3
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:18,150
you know,
when I was in my early twenties,

4
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:23,151
I was writing all sorts of stories and I
wrote a few of these stories about these

5
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:26,370
sort of guys.
Um,

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,420
and an editor,
a editor named Josh Glenn,

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,540
who was the editor of Herman,
ah,

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,300
um,
you know,

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,040
in these stories,
they're not in the book.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,680
They didn't make it into the book.
They weren't very good and he said,

11
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:38,710
you know,
um,

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,070
but he read the stories and he didn't
take them for Herman Monotony,

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,240
didn't publish them,
but he said,

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,280
you should keep doing this.
This is,

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,130
I don't know anyone who knows these
people the way you do.

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,380
Um,
and I was surprised to hear that because

17
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:51,180
I thought everybody knew these people
the way I did.

18
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,261
Um,
and,

19
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,760
you know,
and in a way everybody does.

20
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,000
Um,
and yet there's actually surprisingly

21
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:59,010
little writing about them.

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,310
Um,
and one of the really

23
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,340
a,
to me,

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,180
not terribly surprising but still
disappointing criticism of the book has

25
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:09,710
been,
well,

26
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,050
why do we need to hear about these guys?
We all know guys just like them,

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,490
right?
Which strikes me is,

28
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,403
is,
uh,

29
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,410
an invalid form of literary criticism,
but also strikes me as a refusal of a

30
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:26,340
certain kind of person to admit that
they belong to a social class.

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,370
So,
um,

32
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,380
you know,
you're willing.

33
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,100
So these are people who,
um,

34
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,820
and often this sort of criticism comes
from New York.

35
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,130
It's a kind of provincial criticism,
um,

36
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,580
from people who believe that their own
little world is not worthy of depiction

37
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,260
and literature.
Uh,

38
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,370
whereas first of all,
you know,

39
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:52,080
it's not just New York with either a
young literary men all over the country

40
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:54,300
and in other countries.
Um,

41
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,510
and so it's,
it's a mistake and the provincial

42
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:58,980
mistake,
the fact that they're only in New York,

43
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,870
um,
but more than that,

44
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,280
uh,
you know,

45
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,570
this is actually something that invades,
if talks about the intelligentsia,

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,130
right or in,
in,

47
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,770
in the US,
this literary the sad young literary men

48
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:11,580
and women,
uh,

49
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,450
they form a social class and uh,
they have to admit that to themselves

50
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,480
because while they are willing to a be a
social class in terms of using their,

51
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,230
uh,
their privilege,

52
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,320
um,
uh,

53
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,500
their,
their w,

54
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,720
if they have money,
they're in their class and their money

55
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:28,580
privileged,
uh,

56
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,180
their access to various media,
uh,

57
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,430
which is a form of privilege.

58
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,640
Um,
and uh,

59
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,130
you know,
uh,

60
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,500
the,
all the various networks that they have

61
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:39,690
access to from the colleges that they
went to.

62
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,660
Um,
somehow they refuse to believe that

63
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:44,490
there are social class,
um,

64
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,390
that ought to be depicted in literature.
Um,

65
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,960
except I,
except,

66
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,240
unless it's totally ironic,
right?

67
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,100
Um,
and you know,

68
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:54,250
they do,
and this is,

69
00:02:54,251 --> 00:02:55,860
this is where hipster culture comes
from,

70
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,350
right?
So we have a hipster culture that,

71
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,170
that in a way acknowledges that it
exists as a class and yet only

72
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:03,520
ironically,
right?

73
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,130
I'm only,
uh,

74
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:07,080
and you know,
one of the least,

75
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,260
one of the most unattractive things
about the hipster phenomenon is it's a,

76
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,810
is it's classing down,
right?

77
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:15,430
It's,
its insistence on,

78
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,320
on this form of kitsch.
Were they,

79
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,500
they were a trucker hats,
no trucker hats,

80
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,090
right?
Where they pretend to be from a

81
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:23,190
different social class.
Right?

82
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,960
Um,
this is a very good example of this

83
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:28,470
group of people refusing to acknowledge,
um,

84
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,310
their,
their class privilege,

85
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,050
um,
and,

86
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,120
you know,
so to get back to the book,

87
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,200
the Saturn Larry men or social class A,
they ought to be written about,

88
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,270
they have to be studied.
Um,

89
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,130
and I don't,
unsurprisingly,

90
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,930
a,
you would think everybody would be

91
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:45,820
writing about them because we're all in
it.

92
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,730
Um,
and surprisingly little seems to be

93
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:49,850
written about it.
Uh,

94
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,011
and I think,
you know,

95
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:52,820
I also think,
um,

96
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,960
I also hope that the book is,
is,

97
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,920
is pretty honest about the way these
people behave.

98
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,280
Um,
and how badly they behave.

99
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,970
I think we have a fair amount of
literature that is,

100
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,620
that deals with the men behaving badly,
uh,

101
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,600
but the men are often depicted as total
cats,

102
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,200
a total lo lifes,
total losers.

103
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,540
I'm,
these guys are more complicated than

104
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,374
that,
you know,

105
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,320
um,
they are capable of being very sweet

106
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,521
and,
and,

107
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:30,370
uh,
and sort of supportive and nice.

108
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,500
And then also not so nice.
