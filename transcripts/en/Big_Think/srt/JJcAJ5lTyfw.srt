1
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,060
Well,
Richard Dawkins is very good at,

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,380
at framing science for his audience.
So as an in writing popular science book

3
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,600
books for a worldwide audience of people
who already have a strong interest in

4
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:22,400
science,
he's been a great translator.

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,250
He's discovered the metaphors,
he's discovered.

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,330
Uh,
the stories,

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,680
the examples that really unlock
complexity for his popular science

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,840
audience get,
gets them to understand better the

9
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:37,370
complexity of evolutionary science when
he's now moved into being an atheist

10
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,470
leader.
He's very good.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,330
And the God delusion at writing for an
audience of atheists,

12
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:48,500
people already critical religion or
people who are questioning and what he

13
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:52,550
does a much like bill o'reilly might do
on the O'reilly factor,

14
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:57,020
he provides talking points and
simplifies the arguments against

15
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:58,560
religion.
Um,

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,640
and connecting how science might be used
as a way to argue against religion.

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,980
And people come away from that book with
their preexisting opinions intensified

18
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,380
and also with a lot of talking points to
express their opinion.

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,970
So in,
in fact,

20
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:16,310
he's a social movement leader now he's
mobilized,

21
00:01:16,311 --> 00:01:20,240
he's intensified a movement that's
critical of religion.

22
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,280
But when you move then from his natural
audience out into kind of the swing

23
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:30,281
public people who appreciate science but
also all maybe moderate real religious,

24
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:32,690
they attend church.
They have friends and family who are

25
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:36,500
religious.
They probably lack the motivation and

26
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:40,790
the interest to actually buy his book.
But they do see Time magazine covers

27
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:45,470
that say science versus God.
Or they might catch a snippet of one of

28
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:49,400
the soundbites where he compares
religion to child abuse or religion to

29
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:53,530
fairies are hobgoblins and he becomes
then the bay.

30
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,680
They're very leading example for
Christian fundamentalist to say,

31
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,530
Hey,
everything we've told you about science

32
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:03,140
and religion being conflict.
Here's Richard Dawkins is leading

33
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:06,530
theorists about evolution.
He saying exactly what we've told you is

34
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:09,920
always been always been true is that
getting evolution in schools is really a

35
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,470
way to undermine religion.
Richard Dawkins actually says,

36
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:16,040
if you learn about evolution,
you're probably going to be less

37
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:19,790
religious or evolutionary sciences in
direct conflict with religion.

38
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,150
Um,
and,

39
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,350
and so in that case,
uh,

40
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,500
he can be a polarizing figure.
Uh,

41
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,040
he could actually be used by the other
side to undermine the teaching evolution

42
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,720
in schools,
at least in the United States.

43
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,580
The strongest objections are from what I
call it,

44
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:37,440
the Richard Dawkins School of
Communication.

45
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,330
Uh,
many of these people are out there in

46
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:42,150
the blogosphere.
They feel very intensely about the

47
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:44,130
connection between science and religion.
Uh,

48
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:49,350
they take the viewpoint that a science
undermines the validity of any religious

49
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:50,244
belief,
uh,

50
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,010
in fact even respect for religion.
And so their,

51
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:55,590
their reaction is that,
um,

52
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,440
to say that science and religion are not
in conflict,

53
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,680
uh,
to,

54
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,540
to present evolutionary science in any
way other than just talking about the

55
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,330
facts of the science is not being true
to the science.

56
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,680
It's been,
it's dishonest.

57
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,150
Um,
I've been,

58
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,430
uh,
called at Neville Chamberlain Atheist

59
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,350
Because,
um,

60
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,760
I'm an appeaser of,
of,

61
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,490
of,
uh,

62
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,780
an appeaser and an enabler of people who
really believe in a religion or in God.

63
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,210
Um,
on the other hand,

64
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,380
other scientists have the concern that
this might just translate into spin.

65
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,870
Um,
and that's something that a science

66
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:31,120
institutions should always be careful
about.

67
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:34,120
And that's why we always insist when
talking about climate change,

68
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:37,510
when talking about evolutionary science,
when you package that information in a

69
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:40,540
way that connects to a non traditional
public,

70
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,930
a non science audience,
you always have to remain true to the

71
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:47,170
science and in stem cell research,
that's a great example.

72
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:51,400
In some cases where the reframing of
that issue around social progress,

73
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,090
the ability to lead to cures and
therapies has gone beyond the state of

74
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:57,880
the science.
The uncertainty with therapies can be

75
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:00,040
available.
Oftentimes this has been promoted by

76
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:04,690
politicians such as John Edwards,
who in 2004 said if John Kerry is

77
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:06,640
elected president,
he was campaigning for Carrie,

78
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:08,270
for vice president.
Um,

79
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,140
Christopher Reeve would get up out of a
wheelchair and walk again.

80
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,980
Of course this goes well beyond any type
of timeline therapy we might have

81
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:18,280
available in the foreseeable future.
And that's an example where you can go

82
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:19,900
beyond the science.
And when you do that,

83
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,840
you risk public trust.
So you always have to be careful.

84
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,190
But certainly no one would ever suggest
that Eo Wilson and writing the creation,

85
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:30,160
growing the audience for science by
connecting it to,

86
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,680
um,
religious values or the national

87
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,760
academies and doing audience research as
a way to communicate evolution.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,900
No one ever suggest that Eo Wilson of
the National Academies are spinning the

89
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:42,790
Science.
They're being untruthful about the

90
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:43,624
science

91
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,740
[inaudible].
