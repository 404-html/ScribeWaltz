1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,800
Yeah,

2
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:15,130
imaging technology is a,
is a wonderful enabler of disruption

3
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:22,331
because in the past the doctor could
only listen to find out what's going on

4
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:23,930
in your heart,
in your body,

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,000
or they could feel and they just have to
use their intuition is this normal,

6
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:31,610
abnormal.
They miss a lot of stuff,

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,600
but from a company in Seattle called
Sonos side,

8
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:40,310
as well as from a spinoff of GE medical
systems,

9
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,910
there are now little handheld ultrasound
machines that are very affordable for a

10
00:00:46,461 --> 00:00:51,230
personal care physician to buy and
essentially what it is is a visual

11
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:56,030
stethoscope.
So instead of listening and feeling that

12
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,980
Dr just during a physical exam,
just looks inside of your body and,

13
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:03,890
uh,
and as a consequence,

14
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:08,891
they can see things much earlier and
take action mature earlier than you

15
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:14,261
could if you had to wait until a tumor
got big enough that you could feel at or

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,670
we're experiencing the consequences.

17
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,800
And that brings the ability to look
inside the body right to the doctor's

18
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:26,690
office for much more accurate diagnosis.
At much lower cost.

19
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,620
I'm in general imaging technologies have
preempted what we used to call

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,790
exploratory surgery.
When you couldn't look inside the body,

21
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:42,590
you had to cut it open to see what's
going on and now just being able to look

22
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,110
makes it a lot more affordable and
simple.

23
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,950
Now those machines are very expensive
and so you have to go take your problem

24
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,920
to the solution,
but their technology is in development

25
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:59,921
now that will decentralize the ability
to look inside the body like this little

26
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:05,141
handheld ultrasound.
The other exciting one is the advent of

27
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,230
molecular diagnostics.
Um,

28
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:15,620
it turns out that the body has a very
limited vocabulary,

29
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,030
but it can draw upon when it needs to
express that something has gone wrong

30
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,140
and the body's vocabulary are,
it's physical symptoms.

31
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,940
The problem is there just aren't nearly
enough symptoms to go around for all the

32
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:33,140
diseases that exist.
And so the diseases had to get together

33
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:38,141
and agree to share symptoms of.
The problem then is when you diagnose a

34
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:44,231
disease symptom and it's caused by
multiple different factors,

35
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,340
you cannot have a rules based therapy
because the therapy that works for one

36
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:57,350
patient who's been diagnosed with that
symptomatic disease may not work for

37
00:02:57,351 --> 00:03:00,550
another patient.
Because there are multiple causes of

38
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:05,551
those symptoms and before we,
we didn't understand that care could

39
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:12,700
only be provided through the wisdom and
the experience and intuition of highly

40
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:17,620
trained doctors,
but the genomics revolution has really

41
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,580
enabled us to understand at the
molecular level what these diseases

42
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:27,130
truly are now.
So for example,

43
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:30,820
we thought there was a disease called
type two diabetes

44
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,610
diagnosed when you've got elevated
levels of glucose in your blood.

45
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,070
Turns out that there are about 20
different diseases that agreed to share

46
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,520
elevated blood glucose as their symptom.
And so in the past you couldn't treat

47
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,520
all type two diabetics the same way
because the response was highly variable

48
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:55,570
and now we understand,
oh gosh,

49
00:03:55,571 --> 00:04:00,571
it's because diabetes isn't the disease,
it's those causes that are the disease

50
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,870
and molecular diagnosis is enabling us
one by one to figure out exactly which

51
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:13,000
of those you have that then is the
precursor or the prerequisite to the

52
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:16,970
development of a predictable therapy.
Um,

53
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,860
cancer is going through this transition
in just a marvelous way.

54
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,880
So we used to diagnose cancer and define
the disease by geography.

55
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,000
So you had brain cancer,
blood cancer,

56
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:32,920
bone cancer,
breast cancer,

57
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,820
and you would treat patients who were
diagnosed in that way with a radiation

58
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:43,690
or chemotherapy.
One patient would respond and then the

59
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:48,250
next patient wouldn't respond to the
very same therapy and so you just had to

60
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:51,670
leave it to the intuition of the best
doctors you could find,

61
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,990
but now we understand that that's not
the disease.

62
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,810
In breast cancer,
for example,

63
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:03,811
there are about six different tumors,
each of which can be characterized by

64
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:09,331
the unique molecular pathway by which
the tumor propagates and so there are

65
00:05:09,621 --> 00:05:14,140
six diseases there in that location.
Not One,

66
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,030
but understanding them that you've got
these different types of tumors,

67
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,770
allows you then to begin developing a
therapy that is appropriate and

68
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:28,771
predictably effective for that type of
tumor and it turns out that each of

69
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:32,560
those types of tumor doesn't.
Tumors just doesn't rise only in the

70
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:35,650
breast but arises elsewhere in the body
as well.

71
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,490
And so our ability to cure cancer or to
put it into long term remission is much

72
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:49,510
greater now than it was 10 years ago
because of these molecular diagnostics.

73
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,120
Cervical cancer now is a very well
understood disease.

74
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,350
We understand its causes,
virus in care at that point when you

75
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:05,351
have a an ambiguous diagnosis followed
by a predictably effective therapy and

76
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:10,220
nurse can actually provide that care
just as well as the doctor could,

77
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,080
and that's very exciting.
