1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,000
A lot of people have positioned this
debate as,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,700
you know,
just a battle between the tech industry

3
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:09,060
and the content industry and it's an
insider's game.

4
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:11,520
It's a bunch of rich guys playing around
with each other.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,600
I don't think that's the case.
I think what we're talking about is,

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,790
um,
the freedom to innovate.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,570
That's a very profound and important
thing.

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,410
First of all,
all of the services that,

9
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:28,620
that consumers across the web have come
to know and love.

10
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:30,060
You know,
there are 800 million people using

11
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:33,150
facebook.
The future of those services is at risk

12
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:37,410
and so your use of the Internet is
threatened by this legislation.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,340
If the legislation passes,
it'll mean that you will pay more for a

14
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,660
lot of the things that you've come to,
uh,

15
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,670
appreciate.
Uh,

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,310
and,
and that are much,

17
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:49,560
much less expensive.
Beyond that,

18
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:54,120
there's innovation and there's the pace
of innovation is slowing down the next

19
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:54,630
facebook.

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,950
The next novel service that consumers
would get really excited about is,

21
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,780
is not gonna happen.
You know,

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,150
today,
one of the reasons the Internet has

23
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:07,740
produced such wonderful innovation is
that it's been very inexpensive to start

24
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:10,590
a company.
Foursquare got to 100,000 users on

25
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:15,090
$25,000.
That's unheard of in an era before the

26
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:18,990
open source software that everybody uses
to build on top of and the distribution

27
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:21,680
platform called the internet,
which the end users pay for it.

28
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:22,760
You know,
we all buy our,

29
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:24,990
our,
our access to the Internet ourselves.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,450
And so no,
no,

31
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,320
no supplier of content has to buy the
access the way they used to in the cable

32
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:35,040
world.
And so by lowering the cost of creating

33
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:38,940
new new services,
we've dramatically increased the amount

34
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:41,220
of innovation.
The problem is,

35
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,780
you know,
foursquare is essentially started with

36
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:45,840
three people and they were able to get
to 100,000 users with five or six

37
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:46,470
people.

38
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,350
Um,
now we're going to have three people and

39
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:52,440
a lawyer involved in all of these
startups because,

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,180
uh,
as an investor,

41
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:56,550
we're going to be looking at these.
And the first due diligence question

42
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:58,740
you're going to ask is,
are you clean?

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,140
Is there any risk associated with
liability?

44
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:02,070
You know,
could uh,

45
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,580
one of these people come after you?
Could the attorney general come after

46
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:07,800
you?
What are you doing that might infringe?

47
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:13,010
And the definitions in this legislation
are so vague that no matter how hard

48
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:15,180
they try,
they're not going to be able to give

49
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:19,470
crisp answers to that.
So it creates a huge amount of

50
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:21,750
uncertainty,
which we'll chill investment,

51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,080
which will chill innovation.
The real irony here is if you had to

52
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:28,560
pick the content industries,
least favorite company,

53
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,700
it probably be Google.
What's happening here is that Google has

54
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:35,280
about 200 lawyers on staff today.

55
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,920
It's not going to affect them at all.
They'll fight these guys,

56
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:39,660
they have the money,
they have the lawyers,

57
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,450
they'll just create a team and go fight
these guys.

58
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,660
But if you take a little search engine
startup like duck duck go,

59
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:48,810
which hopes to compete with Google,
which is innovating in novel ways and

60
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:51,780
creating a new experience for consumers.
They have three people.

61
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,300
If the fourth one has to be a lawyer,
they're never going to get there.

62
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,230
And the last thing is to come back to
this notion of the freedom to innovate

63
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:02,410
and why is that so important?
We have a bunch of really difficult

64
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:04,600
problems that we're facing over the next
few years.

65
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,480
And politicians sometimes say,
why are you spending time on,

66
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,590
on this issue?
It's an arcane insider issue.

67
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,510
Um,
but if you think about the problems that

68
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:16,570
we're trying to solve,
the Internet isn't the problem.

69
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,870
The Internet is the solution.
So just think about,

70
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,210
um,
the fact that no matter what,

71
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:26,350
we're going to go through a period of
dislocation as the economy evolves into

72
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:30,910
this more modern on this more modern
platform and people who are in their

73
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,940
forties are going to have to rethink how
they're making living.

74
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:35,800
They're probably going to have to be
more dependent on themselves.

75
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,080
There are going to have to find ways of
retraining themselves.

76
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,210
The way to do that is to use the
Internet to,

77
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,740
to make it possible.
If the,

78
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,410
the idea of retraining workers is done
as part of a government service through

79
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:51,790
a government institution in the old
industrial hierarchical bureaucratic

80
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:55,030
model of delivering the services,
it's going to be phenomenally expensive.

81
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,570
What we're seeing on the Internet is
really nifty education startups where

82
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,910
peers are teaching peers how,
how,

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,050
how to do things.
The cost of that is a tiny fraction of

84
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:08,290
the cost of the old industrial model of
producing these services.

85
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,560
So we need this medium to get us through
these really intractable problems.

86
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:18,670
So it,
it's not just a little inside baseball

87
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,190
argument between two rich kids,
you know,

88
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:25,450
it is,
it is a threat to the foundation of the

89
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:27,670
Internet,
which in turn is a threat to the

90
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:30,020
innovation that we need to dig ourselves
out of these,

91
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,960
these,
these really difficult problems.
