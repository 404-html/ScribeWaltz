1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,410
Well,
that's another great question.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,500
I actually think of myself primarily as
a political intellectual and so,

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,090
um,
I think,

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,390
uh,
a lot of what drove me into legal

5
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:27,160
academia was at,
rather than another kind of academia was

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,880
the idea that I wanted to do something
that was politically engaged with the

7
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:33,010
world.
So my first level is literature as an

8
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:34,690
English major.
As an undergraduate.

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,850
I still teach law and literature
classes.

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,820
I do actually think that literature,
it's a lot to tell us about civil

11
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:43,090
rights,
but at the same time I was very

12
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:46,330
politically active and many,
many humanists to go to law school,

13
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,790
have their stories so it need not
detained as long.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,460
But my thought was if I actually care
about these causes,

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:56,730
I can probably do more for them than to
write papers on the renaissance about

16
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:59,590
them.
And so when I went to law school and I

17
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:00,131
thought,
really,

18
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:05,131
maybe I should go into practice,
but once I delved into the practical or

19
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,880
the world of practice,
I should say,

20
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,450
uh,
I quickly realized that part of what was

21
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:15,451
really important to me was the ideas and
intellectual enterprise.

22
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:19,570
And so I split the difference by
becoming a legal academic who is very

23
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:23,980
engaged in politics and in activism,
particularly gay rights activism,

24
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:27,000
but civil rights activism or broadly,
uh,

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,710
who nonetheless,
I hope is trying to generate some new

26
00:01:29,711 --> 00:01:32,120
ideas about how this kind of activism
activism.
