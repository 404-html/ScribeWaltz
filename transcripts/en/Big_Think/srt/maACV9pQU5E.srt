1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,230
Vascular separate things here,
one is that I argue in the book that the

2
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:13,950
ride versus

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,070
laughed way of looking at American
politics is very obsolete.

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,850
That in fact there are many positions
which used to be called or considered

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,600
leftwing,
which impact on us in the center of

6
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:32,520
American politics and very mainstream
like bring the troops home from Iraq,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,740
a universal healthcare and doing
something about corporate

8
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:39,660
responsibility,
global warming.

9
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:44,130
All these issues are now mainstream,
was 60 to 70 percent approval ratings.

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,730
So the meeting he had continued to
deposit this false dichotomy of right

11
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:54,990
versus left on practically every
political issue.

12
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,330
And the other.
The other problem is that when you look

13
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:04,050
at the facts
and the evidence,

14
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,310
it is not so difficult to realize where
the truth lies.

15
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,670
Then we can have a vigorous discussion
about how to approach the problem or

16
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:15,510
what to do.
Uh,

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,540
but whether I'm there is global warming,
whether evolution is the fact whoever

18
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,670
Iraq is a catastrophe,
it is a pretty clear answers.
