1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,430
And here's a writer I love.
I have actually,

2
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:11,710
this is a man of war and I borrowed my,
my best friend,

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,490
Amy Beach,
was a beautiful a nature writer.

4
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:20,320
She wrote this line about men of war.
The man of war appears to be one

5
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:24,970
individual like Leo Tolstoy,
but it's actually many individuals

6
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:29,870
living together as a colony.
Like Leo Tolstoy said,

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,570
tolstoy.
She,

8
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:37,180
he starts in my head more big wise than
anybody else in the world.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,070
So for years,
tolstoy ended his journal each day with

10
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:47,071
three letters and they show for the
Russian if I live every month.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,640
He began with the note nearer to death.
So a few weeks ago I actually went to

12
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:57,190
Russia and I visited a yes,
Naya,

13
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:01,480
pollyanna.
He stayed outside Moscow and there I

14
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:04,120
learned that he had failed many things
in life.

15
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,590
He failed assets,
schools as an educator,

16
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,110
he failed at breeding horses.

17
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:16,470
He failed at farming and of course he
also failed eventual in his religious

18
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,380
endeavor.
Pretty much the only thing he didn't

19
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:25,381
fail it was to be a writer and asset
babble in the Russian writer.

20
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:29,710
One of my favorite writers said,
if the world could,

21
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,540
if the world could write by itself,
I would write like tolstoy

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,140
and I take that to mean,
you know,

23
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:40,510
we know there are big ways and small
ways in life.

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,330
If you're,
if the world wrote itself like it is

25
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,360
Super Spolan or Porsche,
there'll be all big wise but was tolstoy

26
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,330
there.
The balance of big ways and small lies.

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,460
The big wires.
For many,

28
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,590
I'm a psychiatric ward and to sell too
many people outside in the world can be

29
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:07,480
summarized as such.
Why live?

30
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Why suffer and why suffer on now any one
of us had I answered there and I think

31
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:20,830
particularly for those who have
experienced mental illness,

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,820
there's also another question we cannot
answer.

33
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,470
Why are you you?
Why are you you?

34
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,790
And there are many variations of the
questions.

35
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,500
Why are you not happy?
Why can't you stay hopeful?

36
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,530
Why can't you see the bright side of the
world?

37
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,540
Why are you so selfish?
Why can't you just be like everyone

38
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,630
else?
Why can't you be real?

39
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,490
Why can't you be rational?

40
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,690
The big lies a timeless questions any
asking them.

41
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,320
And then not being able to find answers.
One puts oneself in the timeless trap.

42
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,160
Anyone suffering severe depression may
have the experience,

43
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,690
the time coming to stop one day to the
next,

44
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,750
one minute to the next time,
which is the most precious possession we

45
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:24,241
have becomes the most treacherous thing.
It's time real.

46
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,550
It's time rational.
Is there a way for us to experience time

47
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:33,380
in the real world and rational manner?

48
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,370
Okay.

49
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,370
Time in the world of physics is probably
one of the most democratic experience.

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,280
I would say tom's minute,
as long as my minute a dictator stays.

51
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,550
No one,
not one seconds longer than my day,

52
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,830
but time experienced by each individual
as we all know is so much less

53
00:03:56,881 --> 00:03:59,310
scientific,
so much less reliable

54
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,270
in life.
There are a big license small wise,

55
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,780
easily.
We look around at our lives and come up

56
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:08,400
with abundance.
Small why's,

57
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,880
why do I agree to eat at this
restaurant?

58
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,200
But now they want to cross the street,
which was what I really wanted to go.

59
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,930
Why do I read the news first thing in
the morning when I know I shouldn't?

60
00:04:21,931 --> 00:04:24,750
Because that makes me burn my children's
toast.

61
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,430
Why do I want to train for a marathon
and here is one of my favorite wise,

62
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,650
not asked by me,
but by an older man.

63
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:37,950
When he was the one,
he listened to my public radio and he

64
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:41,520
said,
why did I tell myself this morning?

65
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,520
Now that piece of cake I ate was good
for me.

66
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,570
Okay,
but we don't,

67
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,690
but we don't live to answer all these.
Small wise,

68
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,320
we shouldn't and exhausted,
exhausted parent of small child can

69
00:04:57,391 --> 00:05:01,260
relate to that.
Why do I have to wear shoes?

70
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,450
Why do I have to brush my teeth?
Why can't I sleep in the dog bed?

71
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,380
Where's the puppy?

72
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,023
Yeah,

73
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,200
and then there are the big wise,
the big why's are not always answerable.

74
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,220
In fact,
we may say that they're big lies because

75
00:05:19,221 --> 00:05:24,221
they can be answered.
One of the danger of living is that

76
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:29,411
inevitably we run into people who think
that why has an answer and they think

77
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:35,731
man has to answer for them and when we
can provide a satisfactory answer,

78
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,410
they will do that for us often with a
hasty and judge.

79
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:46,000
A Manto answer.
Big whys are life and death or on a

80
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:50,710
piece that small wise,
when we can find answers,

81
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:51,761
well,
one,

82
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:55,420
we don't even have to find answers,
but just to acknowledge them,

83
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,510
insulate and sustain us.
