1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,690
I think architects are more necessary
than ever because technology can

2
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:13,590
sometimes create the illusion that a
building can be created without a

3
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:16,470
creative hand,
without a creative idea behind it.

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,710
And that's not true at all.
Where technology has helped so far is in

5
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:27,300
the building of extraordinary shapes
that architects can imagine.

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,320
So,
uh,

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,390
you know,
was once possible to imagine strange and

8
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:37,830
complicated shapes that were almost
impossible to build today.

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,220
Technology allows us to build almost
anything but the computer can't create

10
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:46,500
those things.
It can't make them up.

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,530
I'm an architect has to make them up.
Um,

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,880
and in fact,
if we think about frank gary again,

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,090
um,
he is in many ways a very traditional

14
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:57,810
architect.
I mean,

15
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:02,220
he designs on paper and with models and
then the computer takes over.

16
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:04,920
Only later.
Now there's a younger generation of

17
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:09,921
architects who were using the computer
more as a design tool up and they're

18
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:17,130
comfortable with letting the computer
tells them what to do a little bit more,

19
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,640
uh,
rather than merely how to make something

20
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:25,641
that their mind has invented a,
I don't know where that's going to take

21
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:25,980
us.

22
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,320
Um,
I'm,

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,310
I don't,
I don't think of myself as all,

24
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:34,560
but I think I'm old enough to not sort
of naturally feel that that's the way to

25
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,140
do it,
but I'm also,

26
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:40,200
I hope smart enough not to rush to
judgment on it.

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,480
So let's see,
um,

28
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,020
were using the computer as an actual
design tool as opposed to an engineering

29
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:54,870
and construction tool or as a
facilitation tool where all that takes

30
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:55,740
us.
Um,

31
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,150
I don't know yet,
but I do believe that in the same way

32
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:03,660
that computers can be programmed to
write music,

33
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,170
to paint pictures to a write literature.
Um,

34
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,960
I don't know that there will be a time
when they will equal the creative genius

35
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,520
of a human mind,
but they suddenly can facilitate that

36
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:25,521
genius and that we're seeing already
think we can get sort of tired of crazy

37
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:27,930
shapes all the time and we get numb to
them.

38
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,270
Uh,
you know,

39
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,550
and if every,
as Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown

40
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,080
wrote many,
many years ago,

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,510
you know,
if every building is extraordinary,

42
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,540
well then they're really ordinary.
Uh,

43
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,040
so that if the new ordinary just becomes
this kind of frantic,

44
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:47,160
frenetic,
complicated form a,

45
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,170
I don't know that we've achieved much
the,

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,040
uh,
the beauty and the drama in any kind of

47
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,020
urban environment,
any kind of urban setting is in the way

48
00:02:58,021 --> 00:02:59,920
in which different things play against
each other.

49
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,120
I mean,
if you had a building like Frank Gary's

50
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,600
Walt Disney Hall in Los Angeles,
uh,

51
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,730
next door to another gehry building next
door to another,

52
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,320
uh,
all of the same thing.

53
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:19,180
I don't,
or equally a powerful buildings by other

54
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:21,130
architects.
I don't know that you'd have a

55
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,230
particularly appealing urban
environment,

56
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,600
but in the same way that,
you know,

57
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:30,130
a great cathedral in a European city
plays off against the everyday buildings

58
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:33,790
that are there and becomes a kind of
punctuation mark,

59
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,330
if you will.

60
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,330
And the city scape,
that's what we should be doing.

61
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,150
Is Technology going to create a
temptation to do too much all the time?

62
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,440
Uh,
it may,

63
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,130
but,
uh,

64
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,270
as I said,
I think our,

65
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:53,271
our growing awareness of urbanism,
of the idea of the city,

66
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:58,690
which I think is better understood
culturally today than it was 20 years

67
00:03:58,691 --> 00:03:59,800
ago.
Uh,

68
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,681
I think that,
that,

69
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:03,260
that sort of helps balance that off.
And,

70
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:05,800
uh,
we're much more aware that the

71
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,740
background building in fact can be,
uh,

72
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,740
one of the things that makes a city
really nice to be it.

73
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,390
We think about Paris,
you know,

74
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:14,620
they're,
they're great monuments,

75
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:18,820
but then there's the kind of the
ordinary everyday Parisian building that

76
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:23,050
creates the urban fabric.
And that's one of the reasons it works

77
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:26,550
so well is because the great monuments
play off in,

78
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:28,030
in,
in a really beautiful,

79
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,780
sort of harmonic balance against the,
uh,

80
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:32,830
the background fabric.
