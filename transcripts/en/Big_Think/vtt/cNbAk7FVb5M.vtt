1
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Bye love you work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My name is Charlie,</v>

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.210
<v Speaker 1>my questions days associated with you as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scientist and how you've evolved over</v>

3
00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:14.890
<v Speaker 1>time to deal with both sides itself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ethics and morals associated with</v>

4
00:00:14.891 --> 00:00:15.724
<v Speaker 1>sites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll start off with this quote.</v>

6
00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:20.800
<v Speaker 1>So science can tell you how to clean a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannosaurus rex humanities can tell</v>

7
00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:24.640
<v Speaker 1>you why this might be a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my question today is whether or not</v>

8
00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:26.100
<v Speaker 1>you prefer to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.470
<v Speaker 1>the like morals and ethics associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with scientific concepts or the</v>

10
00:00:29.471 --> 00:00:32.590
<v Speaker 1>exploration and explanation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>concepts themselves and which one</v>

11
00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:33.940
<v Speaker 1>engages you to a greater extent.</v>

12
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Charlie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a great question,</v>

13
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.970
<v Speaker 2>but in mathematics you may have run</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the word integer and you know,</v>

14
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 2>may know the word integral and you may</v>
<v Speaker 2>know the word integral.</v>

15
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 2>It's integral to my outlook or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we want is for everybody to be a</v>

16
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 2>complete person with a complete point of</v>
<v Speaker 2>view,</v>

17
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:56.130
<v Speaker 2>a complete understanding of the process</v>
<v Speaker 2>of science,</v>

18
00:00:56.131 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 2>which enables humankind to know nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also to have an appreciation for</v>

19
00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 2>what it means to be a member of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribe,</v>

20
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 2>to be a human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be living here on earth with other</v>

21
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:10.380
<v Speaker 2>humans and other species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we want you to have both an</v>

22
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:15.381
<v Speaker 2>appreciation for the process of science</v>
<v Speaker 2>and an appreciation for ethics or what</v>

23
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:20.421
<v Speaker 2>seems to be the best way to live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best way to conduct yourself on</v>

24
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 2>earth and especially in the human tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with that said,</v>

25
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.380
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always pretty much always harken to</v>

26
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:32.154
<v Speaker 2>evolution.</v>

27
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 2>And here's the extraordinary claim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can evaluate this charlie,</v>

28
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 2>that not only is our size and shape the</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of fingers,</v>

29
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 2>we have our eye color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hair color,</v>

30
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.040
<v Speaker 2>skin color associated with our ancestors</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the genes that were passed to us</v>

31
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:49.470
<v Speaker 2>through the process of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But furthermore,</v>

32
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:54.471
<v Speaker 2>what we feel is a result of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our ancestors who were antisocial jerks</v>

33
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.300
<v Speaker 2>got pushed aside by the ones that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps more social and less jerky.</v>

34
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to be meek.</v>

35
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.060
<v Speaker 2>You want to have the right level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression in the right level of</v>

36
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 2>accommodation with your fellow</v>
<v Speaker 2>creatures.</v>

37
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to ethics,</v>

38
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.060
<v Speaker 2>when you look at whatever scheme you</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel is most reasonable to pass your</v>

39
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:29.001
<v Speaker 2>genes on into the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that usually leads to what we all</v>

40
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 2>consider ethical behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the classic example,</v>

41
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 2>and this is not my fault,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't come running to me Charlie.</v>

42
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

43
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:39.120
<v Speaker 2>this is a thought experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlie.</v>

44
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't bust my chops.</v>

45
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 2>It's not a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The house is on fire.</v>

46
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 2>You have a chance to either save your</v>
<v Speaker 2>son or your grandson by the rules of</v>

47
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 2>this thought experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't save both.</v>

48
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't say,</v>

49
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:56.350
<v Speaker 2>well I find a fire hose and I call in</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

50
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.560
<v Speaker 2>the terminator and he can walk through</v>
<v Speaker 2>Friday.</v>

51
00:02:58.561 --> 00:02:59.410
<v Speaker 2>No you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

52
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 2>you pick your grandson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will always pick the grandson.</v>

53
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 2>You will feel that because that passes</v>
<v Speaker 2>the genes farther into the future.</v>

54
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.610
<v Speaker 2>If you're a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a woman,</v>

55
00:03:10.611 --> 00:03:11.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

56
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll pick whichever offspring is</v>

57
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 2>farthest in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>

58
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

59
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to how you should treat</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people who are not part of your</v>

60
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody who's a human is in somehow is</v>

61
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 2>somehow related.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go far enough back,</v>

62
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 2>everybody is related.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Troubling is that may seem.</v>

63
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 2>And so you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this old thing expressed as the golden</v>

64
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 2>rule rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do unto others as you would have them do</v>

65
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 2>unto you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can do that,</v>

66
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Charlie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you will get through life as</v>

67
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 2>well or better than anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carry on.</v>
