1
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.470
<v Speaker 1>No one is talking honestly about Iraq</v>

2
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.010
<v Speaker 2>and it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very hard to say what our</v>

3
00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:23.011
<v Speaker 2>responsibilities are given the unholy or</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's holy mess that we have</v>

4
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.580
<v Speaker 2>created,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:28.683
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 2>in Iraq</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to shout help.</v>

7
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.220
<v Speaker 2>We need to ask for help from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europeans and we need to open</v>

8
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:43.840
<v Speaker 2>negotiations with the Iranians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to be talking to the Turks,</v>

9
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

10
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 2>and we need to be planning our own</v>
<v Speaker 2>disengagement,</v>

11
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.120
<v Speaker 2>but any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any politician,</v>

12
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.770
<v Speaker 2>any democratic politician who claims</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're gonna withdraw from Iraq and</v>

13
00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:07.771
<v Speaker 2>the near future is just lying to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>American people because I'm.</v>

14
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.210
<v Speaker 2>The Kurds don't want us to withdraw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Sunni chiefs don't want us to</v>

15
00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:16.900
<v Speaker 2>withdraw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Shiite government doesn't want us to</v>

16
00:01:16.901 --> 00:01:19.780
<v Speaker 2>withdraw the Saudis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Kuwaitis,</v>

17
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.450
<v Speaker 2>the Jordanians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Egyptians,</v>

18
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.380
<v Speaker 2>the Israelis and the Turks don't want us</v>
<v Speaker 2>to withdraw.</v>

19
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 2>All of those allies of the United States</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Middle East are very much afraid</v>

20
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 2>of anything that looks like a defeat for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States and a withdrawal on</v>

21
00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:42.970
<v Speaker 2>the schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it hasn't been proposed by Obama and</v>

22
00:01:42.971 --> 00:01:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>

23
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.420
<v Speaker 2>although they've given themselves a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of loopholes.</v>

24
00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:49.330
<v Speaker 2>But withdrawal on that schedule would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a defeat,</v>

25
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.253
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would,</v>

26
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.110
<v Speaker 2>it might be a route.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

27
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.210
<v Speaker 2>and so nobody is going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

28
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.020
<v Speaker 2>and how to plan a disengagement because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

29
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.920
<v Speaker 2>we have to get out how to plan a</v>
<v Speaker 2>disengagement that doesn't,</v>

30
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.260
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't leave everyone that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked with in the Middle East.</v>

31
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm crying how to do that is enormously</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>

32
00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:18.190
<v Speaker 2>And none of the candidates are talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly about those difficulties.</v>
