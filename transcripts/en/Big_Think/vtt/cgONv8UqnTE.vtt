1
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean South Africa is a very</v>

2
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:12.270
<v Speaker 1>interesting case right now because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think I'm</v>

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.190
<v Speaker 1>politically what's happening is in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next couple and the next fortnight</v>

4
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:22.191
<v Speaker 1>actually a new African National Congress</v>
<v Speaker 1>president will be elected and whoever</v>

5
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>becomes president of the ANC effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he becomes president of the country</v>

6
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:29.940
<v Speaker 1>because they get sort of 65 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vote in any national election.</v>

7
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>And the front runner at the moment is</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

8
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.240
<v Speaker 1>the Sky Jacob Zuma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was deputy president and then got</v>

9
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:37.850
<v Speaker 1>fired because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>he was charged with both rape and</v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption.</v>

11
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>He got acquitted on the rape charge that</v>
<v Speaker 1>said the most horrific,</v>

12
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ms dot dennis stick things during the</v>

13
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>trial and the corruption charges being</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of put off and put off and put off</v>

14
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:53.040
<v Speaker 1>in these something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>some funny business going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reason he is interesting is,</v>

16
00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has massive popular support among</v>

17
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.250
<v Speaker 1>low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low,</v>

18
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:03.490
<v Speaker 1>low class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

19
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.510
<v Speaker 1>South Africans who I think feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:11.511
<v Speaker 1>it's been too long now since 94 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not seeing the kind of practical</v>

21
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:15.710
<v Speaker 1>material changes in their lives and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

22
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.090
<v Speaker 1>houses running water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity.</v>

23
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.520
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 1>radicalism that's sort of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being fostered at that level.</v>

25
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:31.791
<v Speaker 1>And for some reason Zuma has captured</v>
<v Speaker 1>the imagination of these people and he</v>

26
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:38.781
<v Speaker 1>is not being seen as the antidote to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the kind of politicians like in</v>

27
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Becky who's the current president or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the extremely wealthy,</v>

28
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black businessmen like Tokyo,</v>

29
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>six waller who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically a mining magnets.</v>

30
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's coming to hid non South Africa is</v>

31
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:58.371
<v Speaker 1>this thing of what happened is a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wealth was just sort of transferred</v>

32
00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>from this tranche of elite whites to</v>
<v Speaker 1>elite blacks and the people on the</v>

33
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So nothing changed in their lives.</v>

34
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.310
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a kind of a backlash against</v>

35
00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:14.160
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's playing out more along class</v>

36
00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:19.161
<v Speaker 1>lines now than it is along race lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Racist still used as a galvanizing</v>

37
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>factor politically.</v>

38
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.220
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zuma will often use whites as scapegoats</v>

40
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>to sort of get people</v>
<v Speaker 1>riled up.</v>

41
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>But really it's an issue of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.430
<v Speaker 1>feeling like not enough has happened to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of</v>

43
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>change the economics of the country in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that benefits ordinary South</v>

44
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Africans that makes him sound like I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 1>much better person than he is.</v>

45
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is one of the things that</v>

46
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>worries me a lot at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like watching a train smash about</v>

47
00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:56.990
<v Speaker 1>to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

48
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the global community doesn't really seem</v>

49
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>to see how terrible it would be if he</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes president.</v>

50
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing you can do,</v>

51
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>but I think if he became president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Africa would go the way of</v>

52
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Zimbabwe within five to 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he would do a land grab.</v>

53
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>I think he would have nationalized all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things.</v>

54
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:21.690
<v Speaker 1>But I think he's a leader who has</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely no.</v>

55
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no qualms about,</v>

56
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.130
<v Speaker 1>doing what is best for him and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scared.</v>

58
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
