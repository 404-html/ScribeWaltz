00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I started doing this about 10 years</v>

2
00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:17.140
<v Speaker 1>ago in London and when I first started</v>
<v Speaker 1>this job,</v>

3
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I used to literally make lists of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Wall Street that I wanted to try to</v>

4
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.420
<v Speaker 1>every given month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would sit and make a list of 30</v>

6
00:00:28.421 --> 00:00:32.830
<v Speaker 1>people and I would cold call literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

7
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.530
<v Speaker 1>introduce myself as a reporter who</v>
<v Speaker 1>planned to be on the beat for a very</v>

8
00:00:38.531 --> 00:00:43.480
<v Speaker 1>long time and thought it was important</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we get to know each other in some</v>

9
00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:44.314
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

10
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.120
<v Speaker 1>I think hopefully over the years people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have</v>

11
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>taken those calls and occasionally those</v>
<v Speaker 1>meetings and a trust level has</v>

12
00:00:56.231 --> 00:00:58.300
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's probably true of any</v>

13
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.633
<v Speaker 1>a reporter.</v>

14
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.730
<v Speaker 1>It's really about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard work shoe,</v>

15
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 1>leather reporting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting on the telephone,</v>

16
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>running around to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my case is to meetings or events to</v>

17
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.610
<v Speaker 1>see different people and a whispering in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ear and hopefully they're gonna</v>

18
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.560
<v Speaker 1>whisper back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tell you the information,</v>

20
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a child,</v>

21
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.900
<v Speaker 1>I always enjoyed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>my parents used to have these little</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocktail parties and I always loved</v>

23
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>trying to get the adults to tell me</v>
<v Speaker 1>things they weren't supposed to say.</v>

24
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>And in many ways that's what my job is</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

25
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 1>It's getting people to tell me things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they probably are otherwise not</v>

26
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>supposed to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you do that by developing</v>

27
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>some semblance of trust that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to be fair and,</v>

28
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

29
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you get it.</v>

30
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>I think that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to study the industry.</v>

31
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I've spent enormous amounts of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can unfortunately do a model,</v>

32
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>a dcf model with the best of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say I enjoy it,</v>

33
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I also think that when you studied</v>

34
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

35
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>when you come to the table with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right questions,</v>

36
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>when it's clear to the other side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

37
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:14.160
<v Speaker 1>to the interviewee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know what you're talking about,</v>

38
00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 1>you can get a lot more.</v>

39
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.510
<v Speaker 1>The hardest part for financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists going forward is actually</v>

40
00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:28.110
<v Speaker 1>going to be to get a straight take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to truly get close to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>action anymore.</v>

42
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I think there was a sense in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties and maybe even part of the</v>

43
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:41.601
<v Speaker 1>nineties and earlier when you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>really get the CEO on the phone any day</v>

44
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could really get inside the story.</v>

45
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.140
<v Speaker 1>But today most of these companies are</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty lawyered up.</v>

46
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.500
<v Speaker 1>They have a PR apparatus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard in real time to actually</v>

47
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:05.971
<v Speaker 1>get a story that hasn't come prespen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while the government is requiring</v>

48
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>more and more disclosures as we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these disclosures are worthless.</v>

49
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>And so it makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes,</v>

50
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>it makes it an enormous challenge to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to,</v>

51
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>to really be able to spot the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.680
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm aware that they're out to lunch</v>

53
00:03:30.681 --> 00:03:33.320
<v Speaker 1>and my goal is usually to tell you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're out to lunch,</v>

54
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't promise I've,</v>

55
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten it right every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrific question because</v>

56
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately in the world of sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street prognosticators,</v>

57
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 1>they only happened to old to be right</v>
<v Speaker 1>once or twice.</v>

58
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 1>So right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nouriel Roubini for example,</v>

59
00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>who called the crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be the guy that you'd want to</v>

60
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 1>hear from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or merit of Whitney who told you that</v>

61
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Citi group was in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be somebody you'd want to spend</v>

62
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 1>time to listen to you when in perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote in an article</v>

63
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.520
<v Speaker 1>what other people would suggest to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were making these arguments</v>

64
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>for six or seven or eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And had you been quoting them then you,</v>

65
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.770
<v Speaker 1>most people would have told you they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were absolutely wildly wrong.</v>

66
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.400
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually a complicated issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>because some of these people will look</v>

67
00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:35.910
<v Speaker 1>right and be right for the moment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then won't be right for a very long</v>

68
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:36.744
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

69
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.350
<v Speaker 1>financial television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plato,</v>

70
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.360
<v Speaker 1>remarkably large role as the medium with</v>
<v Speaker 1>which people were receiving their</v>

71
00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:54.680
<v Speaker 1>information during this crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was probably the first televised</v>

72
00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 1>financial crisis that existed and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have blamed tv for the crisis or</v>

73
00:05:02.391 --> 00:05:07.391
<v Speaker 1>for speeding up the crisis</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there might be some truth to that in</v>

74
00:05:09.321 --> 00:05:12.770
<v Speaker 1>that as journalists who are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflect what's happening in the market,</v>

75
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.570
<v Speaker 1>it gets reflected back and and this sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mirror gets mirrored back and forth</v>

76
00:05:17.571 --> 00:05:21.770
<v Speaker 1>and back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a personalization to a TV as</v>

77
00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:24.890
<v Speaker 1>a medium is so different than reading a</v>
<v Speaker 1>headline that's saying there's a</v>

78
00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:27.290
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're sitting in your office,</v>

79
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:31.110
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's about yourself or</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a firm that you're trading within</v>

80
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:35.300
<v Speaker 1>your hearing and seeing another</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual tell you these folks are in</v>

81
00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:36.134
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>

82
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.890
<v Speaker 1>It really can exacerbate the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not to say that I think all of</v>

83
00:05:43.251 --> 00:05:45.680
<v Speaker 1>these people were doing reporting</v>
<v Speaker 1>irresponsibly.</v>

84
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.990
<v Speaker 1>There were some reports that were wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and there,</v>

85
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.530
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part I must say even</v>
<v Speaker 1>having finished this book,</v>

86
00:05:51.531 --> 00:05:56.531
<v Speaker 1>I watched a lot of tv tapes during this</v>
<v Speaker 1>period and most of the stuff actually</v>

87
00:05:56.661 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 1>stood up quite well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much better than I suspect many people</v>

88
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:01.340
<v Speaker 1>would want to acknowledge.</v>
