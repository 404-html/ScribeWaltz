00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3
00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're living in the,</v>

4
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:19.230
<v Speaker 2>in the first days of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of mass self organization.</v>

5
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 2>clay shirky likes to say this is as big</v>
<v Speaker 2>a change is the admission of the</v>

7
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:29.481
<v Speaker 2>printing press was 500 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We now have ridiculously easy tools for</v>

8
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:35.361
<v Speaker 2>organizing ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the political impact is huge.</v>

9
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.893
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 2>the presidential election just is like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge training ground.</v>

11
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 2>So there were thousands of thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have just gone through an</v>

12
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:49.191
<v Speaker 2>experience of effectively discovering</v>
<v Speaker 2>how good they can be as organizers,</v>

13
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've learned how to a survey,</v>

14
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:58.830
<v Speaker 2>their own local political landscape and</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to deliver the votes that</v>

15
00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 2>were needed for the larger cause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this case of electing Obama,</v>

16
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 2>many of these people aren't going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going back to what they were</v>

17
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 2>before this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

18
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:14.601
<v Speaker 2>the Obama campaign surveyed a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their supporters after the election,</v>

19
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.010
<v Speaker 2>they got about half a million actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>filled out a detailed survey and 10</v>

20
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50,000 people said they're interested in</v>

21
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 2>running for office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means a whole new wave of,</v>

22
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 2>of energy entering the political process</v>
<v Speaker 2>at every level.</v>

23
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 2>And whenever that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

24
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're bound to have a change in as well</v>

25
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.660
<v Speaker 2>in what the incumbents do and as these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get elected and then rise and,</v>

26
00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start running for higher office,</v>

27
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.610
<v Speaker 2>it has a larger societal effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>

28
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might call this the Obamas coattails</v>

29
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 2>and he is just the beginning of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>much bigger wave that's going to spread</v>

30
00:01:58.801 --> 00:02:03.801
<v Speaker 2>through American society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Assuming that we don't have a political</v>

31
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 2>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

32
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lives up to the promises that.</v>
