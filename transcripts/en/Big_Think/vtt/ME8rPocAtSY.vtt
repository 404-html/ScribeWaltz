00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.480
<v Speaker 1>The only overarching purpose or</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction that I can think of for</v>

2
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.490
<v Speaker 1>mankind as a whole is very well</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressed in the definition of humanity,</v>

3
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Pierre Teilhard de Short on</v>

4
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>provided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he was a Jesuit priest who,</v>

5
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived in China for a long time and was a</v>

6
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>kind of an anthropologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

7
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.250
<v Speaker 1>his definition of humanity was evolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>become conscious of itself and it's a</v>

8
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>very powerful point of view if you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

9
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>My sense of humanity as a whole is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

10
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>We are alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become conscious,</v>

11
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore become able to understand</v>

12
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:51.920
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing to set goals and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

13
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>And that I think is possibly unique in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe.</v>
