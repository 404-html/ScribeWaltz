00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Like heroes were actually the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur hunters of the American museum.</v>

2
00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:13.084
<v Speaker 1>Roy Chapman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andrews granger on those guys say going </v>

3
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.293
<v Speaker 1>a certainly a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of heroes within my own </v>

4
00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>disciplines that are probably too </v>
<v Speaker 1>arcane.</v>

5
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.800
<v Speaker 1>But Steven j gold was perhaps my </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest hero.</v>

6
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.140
<v Speaker 1>I knew it very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

7
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.440
<v Speaker 1>I knew him well enough that I got in </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble a lot with him.</v>

8
00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:34.750
<v Speaker 1>He started viewed me as this </v>
<v Speaker 1>cantankerous,</v>

9
00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:37.630
<v Speaker 1>younger brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He once told a Peter,</v>

10
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.333
<v Speaker 1>you'll never be great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're pretty good now that that's </v>

11
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.940
<v Speaker 1>quite a slap in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

12
00:00:42.941 --> 00:00:45.820
<v Speaker 1>We all want to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was from Steve Say,</v>

13
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm great and you're not as great as me.</v>

14
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:48.904
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I liked the fact that you're doing </v>

15
00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:52.570
<v Speaker 1>good work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was that sort of relationship.</v>

16
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I miss him.</v>

17
00:00:54.251 --> 00:00:55.084
<v Speaker 1>I miss his voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the greatest single public </v>

18
00:00:56.591 --> 00:00:59.170
<v Speaker 1>speaker I've ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever heard.</v>

19
00:00:59.171 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>He was also the smartest man I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>known.</v>

20
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I've known quite a few intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

21
00:01:03.881 --> 00:01:07.750
<v Speaker 1>but he was his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his processing speed was beyond belief.</v>

22
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.250
<v Speaker 1>That's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great voice.</v>

23
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.113
<v Speaker 1>Lost</v>

24
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
