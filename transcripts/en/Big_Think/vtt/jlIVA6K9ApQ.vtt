1
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Tight Times is when you're tested hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>

2
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>it's a moment when you can redefine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>slash or sustain the definition of the</v>

3
00:00:18.311 --> 00:00:21.250
<v Speaker 1>firm that you've had up to now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you already a high commitment,</v>

4
00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:25.270
<v Speaker 1>high performance from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to make decisions that are</v>

5
00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:28.270
<v Speaker 1>consistent with the path you've been on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

6
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:29.640
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.750
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you are not a high commitment,</v>

8
00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:34.720
<v Speaker 1>high performance from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to see this as an opportunity</v>

9
00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:38.560
<v Speaker 1>to redefine the nature of the firm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between yourself and</v>

10
00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:40.210
<v Speaker 1>the employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of the,</v>

11
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.360
<v Speaker 1>of the culture and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you do that?</v>

12
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.270
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

14
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>you do not do that by maintaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>distance between yourself and those who,</v>

15
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.551
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.610
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to hurt all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's gotta be,</v>

17
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be some hurt here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>but some of the policies are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

19
00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:01.930
<v Speaker 1>to try to create a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

20
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.670
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an equality of sacrifice.</v>

21
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>So one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.360
<v Speaker 1>one of the approaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high commitment,</v>

23
00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:12.361
<v Speaker 1>high performance organizations use is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a pay freeze or a across the board</v>

24
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:16.810
<v Speaker 1>pay cut as opposed to slicing and dicing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maintaining,</v>

25
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only only certain people and laying off</v>

26
00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 1>people you want to maintain as many of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people as you can that you may still</v>

27
00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:26.860
<v Speaker 1>have to let people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a last stage and if you do</v>

28
00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 1>need to let them go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you let them go based on,</v>

29
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on the fact that somehow their</v>

30
00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>position is going to be eliminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

31
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.200
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing is going to be no</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer central strategically in the</v>

32
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.460
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

33
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.360
<v Speaker 1>and it's based on some measure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance contribution.</v>

34
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.650
<v Speaker 1>But you try to maintain as many of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>employees as you can.</v>

35
00:01:50.651 --> 00:01:53.380
<v Speaker 1>So you take nucor steel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another high commitment high performance</v>

36
00:01:53.381 --> 00:01:55.750
<v Speaker 1>company which has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was born right,</v>

37
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.400
<v Speaker 1>they didn't need to transform.</v>

38
00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.920
<v Speaker 1>What they've done is cut across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>

39
00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:01.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean the steel industry has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>

40
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>So they have been cutting pay by as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>as 50 percent across the board and</v>

41
00:02:07.421 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>making sure that senior leaders is</v>
<v Speaker 1>equality of sacrifice senior leaders to</v>

42
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.610
<v Speaker 1>taking that 50 percent cut and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>that employees understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.960
<v Speaker 1>secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're trying to get more</v>

45
00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 1>engagement with people around solving</v>
<v Speaker 1>the firm's problems in tight times.</v>

46
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.140
<v Speaker 1>So some of the ideas we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

47
00:02:29.141 --> 00:02:32.530
<v Speaker 1>bringing people together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving them a voice about what it is</v>

48
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.030
<v Speaker 1>that the firm can do better both to</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve productivity and performance and</v>

49
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:39.310
<v Speaker 1>also make their life better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

50
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.210
<v Speaker 1>duality of goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we do things right for people and</v>

51
00:02:43.211 --> 00:02:44.620
<v Speaker 1>how do we do things right for</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>

52
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>but engaging people in honest</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

53
00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:49.660
<v Speaker 1>So here's what we're trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

54
00:02:49.661 --> 00:02:51.310
<v Speaker 1>tell us what we're trying to make sense.</v>

55
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have any suggestions?</v>

56
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then engaging them in what the firm</v>

57
00:02:56.981 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>can do differently and better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the argument I would make is that</v>

58
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't already done that,</v>

59
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>what you will learn is an awful lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff you should have learned five,</v>

60
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago about how the firm can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>improved and how productivity can be</v>

61
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>improved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now you're engaging people in a time</v>

62
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>of need for them and the firm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that will make it easier for you</v>

63
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 1>actually to engage people as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>harder.</v>

64
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>But all of this requires that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders engage directly with the people.</v>

65
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 1>It can't be done through announcements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't be done through sending your hr</v>

66
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 1>people out to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

67
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.680
<v Speaker 1>they can be assisting you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

68
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>but you have to go out and talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people directly.</v>

69
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so for example,</v>

70
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 1>diaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ice cream on the west coast when they</v>

71
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.980
<v Speaker 1>had some tough times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 1>quite a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.430
<v Speaker 1>the CEO and some of the leadership team</v>
<v Speaker 1>went around to every part of the</v>

74
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:54.790
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to every employee practically about</v>

75
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:57.000
<v Speaker 1>what the situation of the company was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

76
00:03:57.001 --> 00:03:58.160
<v Speaker 1>what was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will,</v>

77
00:03:58.161 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>what the problem was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they were had to make some changes.</v>

78
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.210
<v Speaker 1>And then engage people in discussions</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
