00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Finding a government that is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsive to,</v>

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the real problems that we're having,</v>

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.740
<v Speaker 1>not just</v>

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.580
<v Speaker 2>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of the globe,</v>

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.000
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't have anything new to add to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

7
00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:22.990
<v Speaker 2>but</v>
<v Speaker 2>as someone said,</v>

8
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.960
<v Speaker 2>read the other day that if we do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

9
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.420
<v Speaker 2>if we start doing something about</v>
<v Speaker 2>climate change now,</v>

10
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.920
<v Speaker 2>it'll be a lot different from starting</v>
<v Speaker 2>five years from now or worse 10 years</v>

11
00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:34.920
<v Speaker 2>from now that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

12
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.930
<v Speaker 2>and I think people's minds are changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've gone,</v>

13
00:00:37.931 --> 00:00:42.550
<v Speaker 2>I think from some sense of alarmism kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a chicken little sense of the</v>

14
00:00:42.551 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 2>planet's gonna Cook Up to 190 degrees</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're all gonna die.</v>

15
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got the evidence just keeps</v>

16
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.480
<v Speaker 2>mounting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

17
00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:54.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has resulted,</v>

18
00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:57.910
<v Speaker 2>I think in a well growing consensus</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

19
00:00:57.911 --> 00:00:58.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that yeah,</v>

20
00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is real and it's not,</v>

21
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.610
<v Speaker 2>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alternatives to war.</v>

22
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

23
00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:09.730
<v Speaker 2>when I was listening to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a talk earlier today,</v>

24
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 2>which talked about lifting a Edm in out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Uganda and placing them somewhere</v>

25
00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:16.650
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

26
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.483
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

27
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.843
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

28
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.380
<v Speaker 2>without destroying the whole country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a way of ways of neutralizing</v>

29
00:01:23.381 --> 00:01:28.381
<v Speaker 2>dictators that are less or that are more</v>
<v Speaker 2>humane and less destructive than just an</v>

30
00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:33.580
<v Speaker 2>all out war on the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

31
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.600
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm a leader that would have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>more inventive sense of strategies</v>

32
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.040
<v Speaker 2>because we need some new paradigm in war</v>
<v Speaker 2>is sort of an,</v>

33
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.520
<v Speaker 2>it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should be over that,</v>

34
00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:53.410
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that old paradigm of just throwing our</v>

35
00:01:53.411 --> 00:01:56.230
<v Speaker 2>youngest people into the face of,</v>

36
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>of danger.</v>
