00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Unmanned aerial vehicle project at x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we call wing houses.</v>

2
00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:15.481
<v Speaker 1>It's aspiration to remove the bulk of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the remaining friction from how we move</v>

3
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.330
<v Speaker 1>physical things around in the physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

4
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.900
<v Speaker 1>particularly the so called last mile</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

5
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.130
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the history of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical things have been moved around</v>

6
00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:31.930
<v Speaker 1>in the physical world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time a chunk of the remaining</v>

7
00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:35.560
<v Speaker 1>friction was removed from that process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boats,</v>

8
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.930
<v Speaker 1>planes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trains,</v>

9
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.290
<v Speaker 1>the automobile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pony Express,</v>

10
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.130
<v Speaker 1>the mail system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every one of these things.</v>

11
00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:50.131
<v Speaker 1>As we got more organized and removed</v>
<v Speaker 1>cost and complexity from how physical</v>

12
00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:55.060
<v Speaker 1>things got moved around in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world became so different that it</v>

13
00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>was impossible beforehand to even</v>
<v Speaker 1>predict how different and how much</v>

14
00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 1>better it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other side of that introduction,</v>

15
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>we take for granted the remaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>friction as though it's natural and will</v>

16
00:01:08.471 --> 00:01:12.520
<v Speaker 1>continue forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could have anything that would</v>

17
00:01:12.521 --> 00:01:17.290
<v Speaker 1>fit in a breadbox brought to you within</v>
<v Speaker 1>one or two minutes,</v>

18
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.290
<v Speaker 1>you still have to pay for the thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in the bread box,</v>

19
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.320
<v Speaker 1>but it could be brought to you nearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>for free.</v>

20
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Then our world would be radically</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

21
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Those batteries that are sitting in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawer in your house or apartment right</v>

22
00:01:32.891 --> 00:01:36.070
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discharging you have those batteries.</v>

23
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>You're wasting the planet because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you might need a few of those</v>

24
00:01:41.591 --> 00:01:45.940
<v Speaker 1>batteries before they fully discharge on</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Christmas morning or something.</v>

25
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.700
<v Speaker 1>But if you believed you could have any</v>
<v Speaker 1>battery,</v>

26
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.000
<v Speaker 1>any shaped a battery you want just in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment you need it,</v>

27
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.640
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't bother holding all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>batteries.</v>

28
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.420
<v Speaker 1>You probably have a hammer in your house</v>
<v Speaker 1>or apartment.</v>

29
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Why do you have that hammer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You almost never use it and we all have</v>

30
00:02:03.311 --> 00:02:06.940
<v Speaker 1>to have a hammer for the occasional</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment when we want the hammer,</v>

31
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.720
<v Speaker 1>but we could probably share one hammer</v>
<v Speaker 1>around 10,000 of us.</v>

32
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Think how much richer the world would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we could have that.</v>

33
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.200
<v Speaker 1>How are we going to make it so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could have the hammer just appear within</v>

34
00:02:20.201 --> 00:02:22.660
<v Speaker 1>a moment or two when you want it.</v>

35
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.160
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to hammer you,</v>

36
00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:28.390
<v Speaker 1>get a cup of coffee at the most and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hammers there and our proposal for how</v>

37
00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:33.391
<v Speaker 1>to do that is that you can make small</v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicles that fly through the air</v>

38
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.650
<v Speaker 1>quietly and very safely and bring to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want.</v>

39
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Our prediction is that at first society</v>
<v Speaker 1>will adopt these for the use of</v>

40
00:02:45.281 --> 00:02:48.550
<v Speaker 1>delivering food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Food is something that almost everybody</v>

41
00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:51.850
<v Speaker 1>uses and that they use on a very regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

42
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>There's already a a very robust food</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivery market and people express an</v>

43
00:02:57.491 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>interest in having a lot more to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>with respect to food.</v>

44
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.870
<v Speaker 1>So that is likely to be the early</v>
<v Speaker 1>adoption of this technology,</v>

45
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.510
<v Speaker 1>but the long run promise of being able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move things around in inside of</v>

46
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:18.541
<v Speaker 1>cities and the suburban areas in</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular without having to create more</v>

47
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:23.941
<v Speaker 1>traffic congestion without the carbon</v>
<v Speaker 1>footprint that comes from large trucks</v>

48
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.010
<v Speaker 1>moving packages around without the sound</v>
<v Speaker 1>and safety problems produced by large</v>

49
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 1>trucks moving around our city.</v>

50
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>All of those problems can be solved by</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying what you want,</v>

51
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>what you need right now to you through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>

52
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.030
<v Speaker 1>We're public about the fact that we did</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than a thousand flights last year</v>

53
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 1>in wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would like to see,</v>

54
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least a hundred times that many this</v>

55
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:53.620
<v Speaker 1>year and 100 times as many of the year</v>
<v Speaker 1>after that.</v>

56
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think that that's a at all</v>

57
00:03:56.441 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>out of the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are regulatory conversations to be</v>

58
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:05.731
<v Speaker 1>had and demonstrations of safety to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>proven as we step through this process</v>

59
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 1>in the United States and in other</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

60
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's important that we push hard on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technology,</v>

61
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>but also work thoughtfully and</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibly with the regulators to</v>

62
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate the safety and to build</v>
<v Speaker 1>their confidence in what we're doing as</v>

63
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>we take each incremental step.</v>
