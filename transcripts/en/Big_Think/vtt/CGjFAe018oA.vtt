1
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>So Oscar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you asked the question,</v>

2
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.200
<v Speaker 1>what are some of the easiest ways that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can prove that the earth is round?</v>

3
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Because apparently this is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're debating.</v>

4
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard thing for me to even start</v>

5
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>talking about because there are so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>proofs that the earth is round.</v>

6
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult to know where to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not okay to think that the</v>

7
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 1>earth is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a viable argument.</v>

8
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have friends who have been on the</v>

9
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:39.270
<v Speaker 1>international space station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have orbited the earth once every</v>

10
00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>90 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

11
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.490
<v Speaker 1>I have had personal experience with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have been up in space and</v>

12
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>can see with their own eyes that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth is round.</v>

13
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.370
<v Speaker 1>And of course we've taken all of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing pictures from space that they're</v>

14
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>so beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those pictures of the earth.</v>

15
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 1>So I don't really know what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now with this earth is flat thing.</v>

16
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>But I will tell you that this is one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things I really enjoyed teaching my</v>

17
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>own astronomy class about because there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are proofs all around you.</v>

18
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>It is not difficult to know that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth is round.</v>

19
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have known this for way more than</v>

20
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>2000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ancient Greeks actually had a number</v>

21
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:19.320
<v Speaker 1>of really elegant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful proofs that the earth was a</v>

22
00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's start from the simple to the</v>

23
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>slightly more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you can see yourself</v>

24
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>with a pair of binoculars is if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually go out to a lake and there are</v>

25
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 1>boats on that lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The farther way of boat is,</v>

26
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>the more the bottom of the boat will</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappear and you'll basically just see</v>

27
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 1>the master of the boat and as a boat</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes farther and farther away,</v>

28
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 1>the last thing you will see is the very</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of the master of that boat.</v>

29
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's because the boat is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>going over the horizon that's curved.</v>

30
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.010
<v Speaker 1>And that means that as it goes farther</v>
<v Speaker 1>and farther away,</v>

31
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>you see less and less of the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and more of the top of that.</v>

32
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.280
<v Speaker 1>You can see that with binoculars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by an ocean,</v>

33
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>by lake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really easy.</v>

34
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't happen if the earth were</v>
<v Speaker 1>flat.</v>

35
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.960
<v Speaker 1>You would simply see the boat getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller and smaller and smaller as it</v>

36
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:09.870
<v Speaker 1>went farther away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'd be able to see the whole thing</v>

37
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 1>with the same proportions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now another way that you can tell that</v>

38
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:19.221
<v Speaker 1>we're on a sphere is to think about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something called the tropics on</v>

39
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>the earth and the tropics are replaces</v>
<v Speaker 1>near the equator of the earth where</v>

40
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the sun is overhead in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sky.</v>

41
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>And this was actually something that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greeks used,</v>

42
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>not only to prove that the earth was</v>
<v Speaker 1>round about 2000 years ago,</v>

43
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>but they actually measured the</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumference of the earth accurate to</v>

44
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>within just a couple of percent.</v>

45
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>2000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've known that the earth was round.</v>

46
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.980
<v Speaker 1>There was a really brilliant Greek</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists called Air Stoss,</v>

47
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>denise and Aristotle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's noticed that there was a town</v>

48
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:52.230
<v Speaker 1>called [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on a certain date,</v>

49
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>the sun would actually shine straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to the bottom of a well.</v>

50
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.160
<v Speaker 1>That meant the sun was directly</v>
<v Speaker 1>overhead.</v>

51
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.170
<v Speaker 1>You could look down a well and see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sun shining back at you and on the very</v>

52
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 1>same date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>farther away in the city of Alexandria,</v>

53
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.570
<v Speaker 1>that didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The son was not directly overhead,</v>

54
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 1>it was a slight angle and all the air</v>
<v Speaker 1>stoss and he's did was he measured the</v>

55
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:20.191
<v Speaker 1>difference in the angle of the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was straight overhead and sign in</v>

56
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Alexandria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a little bit less than overhead</v>

57
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 1>and he rationed that that change in</v>
<v Speaker 1>angle from one city to another was</v>

58
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>probably indicative of us being on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>curved surface.</v>

59
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.260
<v Speaker 1>And you could make all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>measurements even between those two</v>

60
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>cities and see that the angles were</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

61
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>The Sun was at a different place in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sky using this.</v>

62
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>He actually measured the circumference</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the earth and he got it right 2000</v>

63
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So another really simple proof is that</v>

64
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>on any given date at different cities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and different places around the world,</v>

65
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 1>the sun is at different angles in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sky.</v>

66
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't happen if the earth wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

67
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Then there's some other proofs that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little more obscure,</v>

68
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 1>but they're actually really lovely and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is to observe what happens during a</v>

69
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:07.630
<v Speaker 1>lunar eclipse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a lunar eclipse happens when the</v>

70
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Earth casts a shadow on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moon actually goes dark.</v>

71
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:12.880
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've seen one,</v>

72
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.540
<v Speaker 1>you could actually see the earth's</v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow go across the moon and when the</v>

73
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.620
<v Speaker 1>moon is entirely in the Earth Shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon looks kind of dark and even</v>

74
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.550
<v Speaker 1>kind of red colored.</v>

75
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really beautiful.</v>

76
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.150
<v Speaker 1>What's happening in that case is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun is on one side of the earth are</v>

77
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.400
<v Speaker 1>this in the middle and it's casting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A shadow of the earth is casting a</v>

78
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 1>shadow on the moon and as the shadow</v>
<v Speaker 1>moves across the moon,</v>

79
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice that the shadow is curved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's round.</v>

80
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.320
<v Speaker 1>So something like the sun that's bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the earth and is able to cast a</v>

81
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 1>shadow of the earth on the moon can</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually show you the shape of the</v>

82
00:04:44.411 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A high,</v>

83
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but could the earth be a disc?</v>

84
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Could it be flat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's actually still shaped like a</v>

85
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:51.940
<v Speaker 1>disc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like a sphere.</v>

86
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 1>There was a Greek scientists called air</v>
<v Speaker 1>starkist and what he noticed was that</v>

87
00:04:56.381 --> 00:05:00.070
<v Speaker 1>you can get a lunar eclipse at many</v>
<v Speaker 1>different angles where the sun is.</v>

88
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the shadow goes straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the moon.</v>

89
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it just kind of glances the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moon just a little bit as in shadow,</v>

90
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:10.510
<v Speaker 1>just on the top or on the bottom from</v>
<v Speaker 1>every different vantage point,</v>

91
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>every different angle of the sun is</v>
<v Speaker 1>casting a shadow.</v>

92
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>You always get a perfectly curved</v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow.</v>

93
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.990
<v Speaker 1>The only shape that can cast a shadow</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's curved from any direction you put</v>

94
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:26.440
<v Speaker 1>the light is a sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people have known that the earth is</v>

95
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:31.441
<v Speaker 1>spherical for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not okay to say that the earth is</v>

96
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is some sort of strange denial.</v>

97
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:37.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where it comes from and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something where I keep getting this</v>

98
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really need to put this question to</v>

99
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 1>bed because we've known the earth as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sphere for a long time.</v>

100
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>They there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some even well meaning people</v>

101
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.630
<v Speaker 1>that have kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.061
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

103
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't really believe the earth is</v>
<v Speaker 1>flat,</v>

104
00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:52.630
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not really sure what to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

105
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.060
<v Speaker 1>And they've asked me some interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions like,</v>

106
00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

107
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've heard that the,</v>

108
00:05:57.501 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that space is very hot.</v>

109
00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.661
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you,</v>

110
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 1>when you go up above the atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temperature spaces millions of</v>

111
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.693
<v Speaker 1>degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is true.</v>

112
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.481
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

113
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is there's basically no air</v>

114
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:09.291
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

115
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gas right around the earth is</v>

116
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.160
<v Speaker 1>actually millions of degrees hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually true.</v>

117
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 1>But there's almost no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of it.</v>

118
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 1>There's almost nothing like one single</v>
<v Speaker 1>Proton whizzes by you at a temperature</v>

119
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 1>of a million degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same as temperature like</v>

120
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.001
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the air.</v>

121
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:27.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that one was a one that I get some</v>

122
00:06:27.181 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other one is,</v>

123
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually said this to somebody I</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't believe they'd never thought of</v>

124
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

125
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with binoculars,</v>

126
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:36.170
<v Speaker 1>you can see planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see Saturn and Jupiter.</v>

127
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:36.921
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can see,</v>

128
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Mars with a telescope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun,</v>

129
00:06:38.671 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 1>the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else you see in solar system</v>

130
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:43.730
<v Speaker 1>is a sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're,</v>

131
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 1>we're the one thing that is different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

132
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:47.661
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that actually,</v>

133
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 1>that actually made somebody who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was more interested in actually</v>

134
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 1>hearing information that she got them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

135
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:53.150
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

136
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

137
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.150
<v Speaker 1>everything else we take a picture of as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sphere.</v>

138
00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
