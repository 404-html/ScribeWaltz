1
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the symptoms don't show up</v>
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>

2
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a kind of natural healing</v>

3
00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:19.660
<v Speaker 1>that can go on just by leaving a war</v>
<v Speaker 1>zone.</v>

4
00:00:19.661 --> 00:00:23.290
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it's not good to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people we think now right afterwards,</v>

5
00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:26.950
<v Speaker 1>but rather to almost let the wound heal</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit on its own.</v>

6
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of the symptoms were aware of</v>

7
00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:31.750
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.130
<v Speaker 1>and they will be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.760
<v Speaker 1>a hypervigilance being in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper sensory mode.</v>

10
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.840
<v Speaker 1>So walking the perimeter are listening</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a cuteness the way you would in a</v>

11
00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:42.230
<v Speaker 1>battle area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.400
<v Speaker 1>or it might also be flashbacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.720
<v Speaker 1>inability to sleep or just one moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my soldiers to rob kiss low,</v>

14
00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:54.280
<v Speaker 1>just found himself in a bar with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>arms around someone's neck.</v>

15
00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:56.200
<v Speaker 1>He strangled this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.660
<v Speaker 1>and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he realized that he had heard</v>

17
00:00:58.661 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>something and thought he was in fighter</v>
<v Speaker 1>mode and it just slipped into fighter</v>

18
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.460
<v Speaker 1>mode imperceptibly.</v>

19
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was about a year,</v>

20
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after battle he was in,</v>

21
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.000
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.980
<v Speaker 1>a long term patient at Walter Reed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>being treated by the way for physical</v>

23
00:01:14.981 --> 00:01:15.814
<v Speaker 1>injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.930
<v Speaker 1>loss of arm use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>titanium armor placement in a and a leg</v>

25
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:21.190
<v Speaker 1>replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.220
<v Speaker 1>other times it could also just be this</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbing that you,</v>

27
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.620
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had to,</v>

28
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're exposed to the sorts of stresses</v>

29
00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:32.680
<v Speaker 1>that are so superhuman that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect yourself by numbing and you,</v>

30
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.330
<v Speaker 1>you continued to dissociate afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are some of the physical,</v>

31
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physiological effects that we're</v>

32
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.580
<v Speaker 1>familiar with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm trying to explore,</v>

33
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the,</v>

34
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>the spectrum that doesn't necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.620
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in what may include some of these,</v>

36
00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:53.440
<v Speaker 1>but also includes these con conflict</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings,</v>

37
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:58.060
<v Speaker 1>get sexual feelings of feeling some</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilt for what you did or what you saw</v>

38
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.020
<v Speaker 1>and did your best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but couldn't help to do even better than</v>

39
00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:05.520
<v Speaker 1>you wished you could have done to</v>
<v Speaker 1>survive about all.</v>

40
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when your buddies does don't to be part</v>

<v Speaker 1>causally implicated,</v>

45
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.900
<v Speaker 1>and you hold yourself really accountable</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to love your buddies more than you</v>

<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

54
00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:48.370
