1
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.840
<v Speaker 1>I think if we raise our standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our urban schools,</v>

2
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.740
<v Speaker 1>and if we can possibly attract a better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more qualified pool of teachers down the</v>

3
00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:22.151
<v Speaker 1>road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can do fantastic things in inner city</v>

4
00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:24.440
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In our school,</v>

5
00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:29.441
<v Speaker 1>University Academy for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we pay performance pay,</v>

6
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.170
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in addition to a teacher's salary.</v>

7
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 1>We have an incentive for a teacher to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in the classroom.</v>

8
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.200
<v Speaker 1>And so we attract a slightly different</v>
<v Speaker 1>type of teacher.</v>

9
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.410
<v Speaker 1>One Who is motivated to do well and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's an important when you</v>

10
00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:53.270
<v Speaker 1>look at other service businesses and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>only in the United States but around the</v>

11
00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:56.330
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's common for managers to get</v>

12
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>incentives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial incentives to do a good job.</v>

13
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.350
<v Speaker 1>But we've never really done much of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the area of education,</v>

14
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:08.351
<v Speaker 1>which really is a service business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think if we can pay teachers</v>

15
00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:12.410
<v Speaker 1>competitively and attract and retain</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

16
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.130
<v Speaker 1>we can do great things in this gun.</v>
