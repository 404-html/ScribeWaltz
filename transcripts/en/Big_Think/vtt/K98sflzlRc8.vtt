00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.580
<v Speaker 1>The secret to gaining the upper hand in</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiations is giving the other side</v>

2
00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:14.581
<v Speaker 1>the illusion of control and the illusion</v>
<v Speaker 1>of control is typically best given with</v>

3
00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:23.941
<v Speaker 1>either questions that begin with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>words what or how both what and how</v>

4
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.600
<v Speaker 1>should be the form of nearly any</v>
<v Speaker 1>question where you're trying to gather</v>

5
00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:32.500
<v Speaker 1>information and it's actually one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways we say no.</v>

6
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Speaker 1>The first and best way to say no to</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone is</v>

7
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.730
<v Speaker 1>how am I supposed to do that?</v>

8
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Now the other side actually has no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a number of things you've done</v>

9
00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:51.410
<v Speaker 1>with them at the same time</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've conveyed to them you have a</v>

10
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:55.430
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that we also refer to as</v>

11
00:00:55.431 --> 00:01:00.080
<v Speaker 1>forced empathy because one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why we exercise tactical empathy</v>

12
00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>is because we want the other side to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>us fairly.</v>

13
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.980
<v Speaker 1>We want them to see our position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want them to see the issues we have.</v>

14
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.480
<v Speaker 1>We want them to see the constraints that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have and when you say to somebody,</v>

15
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.250
<v Speaker 1>how am I supposed to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make them take a look at your</v>

16
00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:21.251
<v Speaker 1>situation before they respond and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it in a number of different</v>

17
00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:27.311
<v Speaker 1>ways at a number of different people</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've coached with negotiations who have</v>

18
00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:31.490
<v Speaker 1>felt completely helpless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They felt completely taken hostage.</v>

19
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.460
<v Speaker 1>One instance where a woman thought she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was taken hostage to the future and she</v>

20
00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:38.060
<v Speaker 1>just wasn't getting paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They called her up to give him more work</v>

21
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.200
<v Speaker 1>and we taught her to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trained or counseled her to say,</v>

22
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.900
<v Speaker 1>how am I supposed to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought about it for awhile.</v>

23
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.810
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

24
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:48.644
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

25
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.090
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed that response is not word</v>
<v Speaker 1>for word directly responsive to her</v>

26
00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:57.970
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they responded to was they felt</v>

27
00:01:57.971 --> 00:01:59.080
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said to them,</v>

28
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've reached my limit</v>

29
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.500
<v Speaker 1>and it's a way to establish a limit in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that doesn't back the other side</v>

30
00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:13.460
<v Speaker 1>into a corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're really want to be able to let out</v>

31
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 1>no a little bit at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the first way to start letting out</v>

32
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:21.110
<v Speaker 1>no as an answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how am I supposed to do that?</v>

33
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Now ultimately with that question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all imagine that the other side is</v>

34
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 1>going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I said so,</v>

35
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>because you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually where you ultimately</v>

36
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:37.220
<v Speaker 1>want to be with that question because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say how am I supposed to do</v>

37
00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:38.360
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other side says,</v>

38
00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 1>because if you want this deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have to.</v>

39
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.760
<v Speaker 1>What you've just found out is they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been pushed to the limit on that issue</v>

40
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.930
<v Speaker 1>as far as they'll go and the eternal</v>
<v Speaker 1>question is,</v>

41
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.200
<v Speaker 1>have I gotten everything I could on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on the table?</v>

42
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a great way to find out whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not you've gotten everything you on</v>

43
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>that particular term because the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

44
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>most angry responses because you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

45
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>which is not them walking away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not them terminating the deal.</v>

46
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not them giving you any more of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimatum.</v>

47
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>It's them saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

48
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>I've got no more room to give without</v>
<v Speaker 1>the negotiations breaking off.</v>

49
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 1>So given the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the illusion of control while signaling</v>

50
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 1>limits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great way to stay in the</v>

51
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>conversation and find out that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not leaving anything on the table.</v>

52
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 1>It was coaching a real estate</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiation recently and that the agent</v>

53
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:42.931
<v Speaker 1>was trying to lease a very expensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>home in the Hollywood hills and the</v>

54
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>first time they said to the leasing</v>
<v Speaker 1>agent,</v>

55
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 1>how are we supposed to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The leasing agent relented on a number</v>

56
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>of the terms conversation continued for</v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>

57
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.760
<v Speaker 1>They came to another term that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much almost an impasse and the</v>

58
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>person doing the negotiation says that</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are we supposed to do that?</v>

59
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 1>And the leasing agent said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want the house,</v>

60
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which was a confirmation that they've</v>

61
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 1>gotten as much as it could have out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that term.</v>

62
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>So it's a great way to give the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>side the illusion of control because</v>

63
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 1>what many people need to feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in control under negotiation and</v>

64
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 1>when they feel like they're out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>

65
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.950
<v Speaker 1>they're impossible to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the more you let the other side feels</v>

66
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 1>like they're in control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more amenable they are to</v>

67
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 1>collaboration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really don't want people to feel out</v>

68
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 1>of control.</v>
