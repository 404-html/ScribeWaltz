00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.850
<v Speaker 2>when we started the Tribeca film</v>
<v Speaker 2>festival,</v>

3
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 2>which we announced in 2001 right after</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11,</v>

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to really bring people back to our</v>

5
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our goal was to just bring as many</v>

6
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:23.070
<v Speaker 2>people back downtown is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we announced the first film</v>

7
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 2>festival,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we asked Nelson Mandela to come and</v>

8
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 2>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our city had been devastated.</v>

9
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.920
<v Speaker 2>Our country has been devastated by nine</v>
<v Speaker 2>slash 11.</v>

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.280
<v Speaker 2>And as filmmakers we didn't know what to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do other than literally to put on a show</v>

11
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 2>and to try to give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to give our neighborhood a new</v>

12
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 2>memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to give New York a new memory and</v>

13
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.980
<v Speaker 2>you just couldn't go like start running</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>

14
00:00:55.051 --> 00:01:00.051
<v Speaker 2>So men Mandela came and he talked about</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was in Robben Island,</v>

15
00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 2>when he was in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the one night that he and his</v>

16
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 2>jailers all looked forward to was movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

17
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 2>It's when they could come together and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could laugh about the same thing.</v>

18
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 2>They could cry about the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were,</v>

19
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 2>they were one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was finding their similarities,</v>

20
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:24.600
<v Speaker 2>finding what was human about each of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

21
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.660
<v Speaker 2>And no matter what side of the door</v>
<v Speaker 2>either one was going to end up at,</v>

22
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.130
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I always think back to that and the</v>

23
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.520
<v Speaker 2>sense of community of coming together as</v>
<v Speaker 2>community to watch something is actually</v>

24
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the nea in potential</v>

25
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 2>cuts to the nea and you look at what</v>
<v Speaker 2>would happen to pbs,</v>

26
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's criminal,</v>

27
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The arts reflect to a country what a</v>

28
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 2>country is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The arts reflect who we are as a people</v>

29
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 2>and to lose that is losing part of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our soul.</v>

30
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nea has been,</v>

31
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there've been other administrations that</v>

32
00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:23.480
<v Speaker 2>have tried to cut the nea before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

33
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.040
<v Speaker 2>but it's such a small amount in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>budget.</v>

34
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.510
<v Speaker 2>And it is again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reflection of,</v>

35
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.110
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of who we are as a people and no matter</v>

36
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:39.111
<v Speaker 2>where you are in the ecosystem of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>a filmmaker,</v>

37
00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:42.870
<v Speaker 2>a producer and actor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is always hard to get your project.</v>

38
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

39
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it happens very quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part,</v>

40
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's never easy will artists get by</v>

41
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 2>while we find a way to make work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

42
00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.590
<v Speaker 2>But when I looked and I talked to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend will be Goldberg.</v>

43
00:03:00.891 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 2>Some of her early work was funded by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>NEA.</v>

44
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a wonderful piece on youtube of</v>

45
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.370
<v Speaker 2>Mr Rogers talking to Senator John Lopez</v>
<v Speaker 2>story explaining what he did as Mr</v>

46
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Rogers on pbs and it's just so charming</v>
<v Speaker 2>to listen to that and you're going,</v>

47
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 2>how can you cut that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things is that our best,</v>

48
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.460
<v Speaker 2>our best export becomes our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our shows or movies or entertainment.</v>

49
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember reading a piece after,</v>

50
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was nick kristoff writing</v>

51
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 2>about how when they first went into</v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan and,</v>

52
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:48.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

53
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the nineties and people were digging</v>

54
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:56.311
<v Speaker 2>up their old vcrs after the Taliban had</v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

55
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 2>At that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were digging,</v>

56
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 2>going into the backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>digging up vrs and they were coming with</v>

57
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They don't always love us,</v>

63
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.440
<v Speaker 2>but movies do remain a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
