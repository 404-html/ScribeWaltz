00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm Tom Stemberg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the managing general partner of the</v>

5
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:29.901
<v Speaker 2>highland consumer funds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without question.</v>

6
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 2>A lot of entrepreneurial ideas come out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of challenging times.</v>

7
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I always say that entrepreneurs are</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks who turned adversity into</v>

8
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.300
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A good example of that is right now in</v>

9
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 2>the retail space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I tend to vest in the retail space,</v>

10
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 2>you can finally afford to open units in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan.</v>

11
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the past decade,</v>

12
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.800
<v Speaker 2>rents were so absurd that unless you had</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous price points at obscene gross</v>

13
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 2>margins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't possibly afford to pay the</v>

14
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 2>rent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

15
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 2>that's changed very dramatically over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last 12 months.</v>

16
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's unbalanced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a good thing.</v>

17
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we will see lots of great ideas</v>

18
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.750
<v Speaker 2>spawned out of this downturn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Engineers who get laid off from big</v>

19
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 2>companies are going to start new</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies and those kinds of companies</v>

20
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 2>are going to change things going into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future.</v>

21
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.721
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>B,</v>

22
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 2>they in communications between energy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be they in lots of other areas.</v>

23
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.001
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

24
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:43.001
<v Speaker 2>obviously those entities which are</v>
<v Speaker 2>positioned as value brands will do</v>

25
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 2>better than those who are perceived as</v>
<v Speaker 2>high price or,</v>

26
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.610
<v Speaker 2>or having frills to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to be clear you want to be there,</v>

27
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.410
<v Speaker 2>but having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you don't want to do is begin to</v>

28
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.700
<v Speaker 2>move away from your fundamental brand</v>
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>

29
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.510
<v Speaker 2>just kind of as a temporary fix during a</v>
<v Speaker 2>downtime.</v>

30
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:10.511
<v Speaker 2>So what we've seen lots of people do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>is during these times say,</v>

31
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:11.414
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

32
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm brand x and would I create something</v>
<v Speaker 2>called kind of brand x and where they</v>

33
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:23.021
<v Speaker 2>used to sell brand decks to full price</v>
<v Speaker 2>retailers and now so it kind of brand x</v>

34
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 2>to Walmart and Costco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what happens is the full price</v>

35
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 2>full service retail say I'm not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do business with these guys anymore.</v>

36
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.180
<v Speaker 2>And next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically destroyed their entire</v>

37
00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:37.700
<v Speaker 2>brand equity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's happened too often.</v>

38
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.230
<v Speaker 2>So you got to be very careful and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sticking to what your brand stands for</v>

39
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:43.064
<v Speaker 2>in the consumer's mind.</v>

40
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the generic brands were an outgrowth of</v>

41
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:54.741
<v Speaker 2>the Jimmy Carter stagflation years where</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economy was declining.</v>

42
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:57.180
<v Speaker 2>And we combine that with a high double</v>
<v Speaker 2>digit,</v>

43
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 2>almost 20 percent interest rates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

44
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.460
<v Speaker 2>fortunately we don't face that today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

45
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 2>the but inflation was running rampant</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got to be very clear with you that</v>

46
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I did not invent generic brands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I copied them if company in France</v>

47
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:15.871
<v Speaker 2>called cuff for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had created something called Lipo which</v>

48
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 2>were so called free products,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free from advertising free from</v>

49
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 2>expensive marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the fundamentalist.</v>

50
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my boss at jewel,</v>

51
00:03:23.421 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 2>a gentleman named Don Perkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw this in Europe and brought it back</v>

52
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 2>to his company is say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

53
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 2>you got to try this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of the,</v>

54
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 2>the divisions and the bigger divisions</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to run with the idea because</v>

55
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 2>they were worried it would cannibalize</v>
<v Speaker 2>their private label at lower margins,</v>

56
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.593
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

57
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 2>I was the head of marketing at star</v>
<v Speaker 2>market in boston where we had a very</v>

58
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 2>high quality of but a high price</v>
<v Speaker 2>reputation.</v>

59
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a big idea that if we</v>

60
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurially move forward to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could change our price perception</v>

61
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:53.610
<v Speaker 2>overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

62
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.110
<v Speaker 2>therefore we copied it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we rebranded it.</v>

63
00:03:56.111 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 2>No name brands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] a great low cost restaurant</v>

64
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:03.820
<v Speaker 2>in boston called the no name and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>figured we live off that we call the no</v>

65
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 2>name brands and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turned out to be an overnight success</v>

66
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:09.270
<v Speaker 2>and we didn't have to advertise it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we,</v>

67
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 2>all the news media climbing all over it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the prices are so dramatically low</v>

68
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:17.581
<v Speaker 2>what it took care of itself and was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interesting venture that overtime</v>

69
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.080
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

70
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's time come and go.</v>

71
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a couple things that I'd</v>

72
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:31.060
<v Speaker 2>say as I reflect back on my staples</v>
<v Speaker 2>career and gosh,</v>

73
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of things I'm incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>proud of having done,</v>

74
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 2>including giving us a leadership</v>
<v Speaker 2>position on the internet.</v>

75
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.080
<v Speaker 2>One I'm less proud of is how we approach</v>
<v Speaker 2>international because frankly we</v>

76
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:45.950
<v Speaker 2>approached international too soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

77
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 2>Canada was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was worked out well and that was early</v>

78
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:51.180
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's close enough.</v>

79
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 2>That worked out great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go through the historical profit</v>

80
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 2>and loss statements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not today,</v>

81
00:04:55.811 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 2>But how they used to be a 10 years ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>or so in 15 years ago in Germany and</v>

82
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:02.380
<v Speaker 2>england,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and is not a pretty picture.</v>

83
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.020
<v Speaker 2>It's extremely hard to take any kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people intensive business from the</v>

84
00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:13.501
<v Speaker 2>United States over to europe and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

85
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Speaker 2>for all our economic problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd argue there's are worse than ours.</v>

86
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean with their pension obligations</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the union structures.</v>

87
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.110
<v Speaker 2>I think actually they have more problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>than we do and we got plenty of problems</v>

88
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.440
<v Speaker 2>so that the notion you somehow another</v>
<v Speaker 2>find growth and prosperity in europe and</v>

89
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 2>it's easy or that england is easy</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they speak the same language.</v>

90
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.560
<v Speaker 2>It is just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

91
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.790
<v Speaker 2>I had a colleague at staples named joe</v>
<v Speaker 2>vessel.</v>

92
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.090
<v Speaker 2>So what a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a great line.</v>

93
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 2>He quoted churchill and saying in</v>
<v Speaker 2>england and the us were two countries</v>

94
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:51.970
<v Speaker 2>divided by a common language in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>example and england when they were</v>

95
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:54.610
<v Speaker 2>forced to turnover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means revenues is a good thing.</v>

96
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.080
<v Speaker 2>We talked about turnover here in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>

97
00:05:56.081 --> 00:06:00.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that indian China harbor nola as</v>

98
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 2>difficulties from an expansion for</v>
<v Speaker 2>interview than england,</v>

99
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Germany arguably they're even more</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>

100
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.950
<v Speaker 2>Having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the good news about england,</v>

101
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.430
<v Speaker 2>about China and India is you've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>explosive growth and growth covers on</v>

102
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 2>awful lot of sins.</v>

103
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 2>So even with the chinese growth</v>
<v Speaker 2>moderating,</v>

104
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 2>it's moderating to still be amongst the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fastest,</v>

105
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 2>if not the fastest growing economy in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

106
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had terrific success there with</v>

107
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 2>staples were invested in the business</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's now grown to be a several hundred</v>

108
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.963
<v Speaker 2>million dollar business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

109
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.880
<v Speaker 2>I've got lots of friends over there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

110
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I still see tremendous opportunities</v>

111
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:43.280
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly in the consumer segment and</v>

112
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:46.010
<v Speaker 2>in retailing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see lots of opportunities in China,</v>

113
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 2>India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

114
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.530
<v Speaker 2>I would characterize it similarly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So having said that,</v>

115
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

116
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 2>if you're a software business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably easier if you're in the</v>

117
00:06:56.301 --> 00:06:59.870
<v Speaker 2>retail business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The challenge of dIstribution over there</v>

118
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:02.150
<v Speaker 2>and the fact there's not really road</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns over there.</v>

119
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it makes it very,</v>

120
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:05.234
<v Speaker 2>very challenging.</v>

121
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:13.270
<v Speaker 2>I think the first thing I would advise</v>
<v Speaker 2>any chief executive entering these</v>

122
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:17.210
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think interestingly in this time</v>

123
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't have to advise the ceos,</v>

124
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 2>the good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like Christine Day,</v>

125
00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:27.131
<v Speaker 2>a little lemon or tommy folio at carmax</v>
<v Speaker 2>or fill francis at petsmart,</v>

126
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 2>didn't have to be told.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They on their own realized that they had</v>

127
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:37.250
<v Speaker 2>to prepare their companies for what</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be a calamitous situation.</v>

128
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.150
<v Speaker 2>You just didn't know how bad it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get and in virtually every case</v>

129
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.960
<v Speaker 2>they planned for scenarios that turned</v>
<v Speaker 2>out to be far worse than at least we've</v>

130
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:49.460
<v Speaker 2>seen to date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having done that in first and foremost</v>

131
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.040
<v Speaker 2>have insured survival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your first job.</v>

132
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Once you've gotten to that point and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see sort of the dust settle and I'm</v>

133
00:07:57.861 --> 00:07:59.840
<v Speaker 2>an optimist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think that does more or less has</v>

134
00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:03.420
<v Speaker 2>settled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you now have to become</v>

135
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 2>opportunistic very quickly and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost have to turn it a hundred and 80</v>

136
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 2>degrees and I see these companies now</v>
<v Speaker 2>are poisoned themselves to grow.</v>

137
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:16.430
<v Speaker 2>But Christine Day was in New York half</v>
<v Speaker 2>of lulu lemon about a week ago and</v>

138
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.160
<v Speaker 2>that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very exciting company and she came in</v>

139
00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:21.290
<v Speaker 2>and basically said to the landlords</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

140
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.230
<v Speaker 2>gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you follow the following guidelines</v>

141
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:29.231
<v Speaker 2>we have for a new leases going forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're now prepared to look at</v>

142
00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:31.790
<v Speaker 2>opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you still have some of these</v>

143
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:34.020
<v Speaker 2>crazy red ideas that came about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

144

145

<v Speaker 2>just hold onto your property and we'll,</v>
