<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.190
<v Speaker 1>The contemporary Internet is based on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental lie.</v>

3
00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:13.180
<v Speaker 1>We all are told that it's social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all told they did.</v>

4
00:00:13.181 --> 00:00:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Now it's connectivity allows us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create community,</v>

5
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.080
<v Speaker 1>but the reverse is actually true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's atomizing us.</v>

6
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not creating real community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually separating us from people</v>

7
00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:27.760
<v Speaker 1>have different opinions of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>

8
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.990
<v Speaker 1>It's increasingly an echo chamber effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're only ever connected with</v>

9
00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:33.790
<v Speaker 1>people who agree with us in the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

10
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.180
<v Speaker 1>but even more troubling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These social networks aren't really</v>

11
00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:40.180
<v Speaker 1>social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're platforms for the self that</v>

12
00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:43.540
<v Speaker 1>plops for that platforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For us to build brands.</v>

13
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.290
<v Speaker 1>The clearest manifestation of this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>our obsession with the selfie.</v>

14
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.010
<v Speaker 1>The selfie becomes the cultural form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet.</v>

15
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Wherever we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we picture ourselves in front of</v>

16
00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:57.550
<v Speaker 1>mausoleums in front of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I say in the book,</v>

17
00:00:57.551 --> 00:01:02.551
<v Speaker 1>in front of people committing suicide at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Auschwitz at every imaginable place.</v>

18
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.520
<v Speaker 1>In spite of all the bad taste associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

19
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>We are in our minds at least are diluted</v>
<v Speaker 1>minds.</v>

20
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.460
<v Speaker 1>The center of our universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I argue again in terms of progress,</v>

21
00:01:15.461 --> 00:01:19.090
<v Speaker 1>that we've gone back to a a pre</v>
<v Speaker 1>kapernick and understanding of the</v>

22
00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:21.940
<v Speaker 1>universe where everything of revolves</v>
<v Speaker 1>around us.</v>

23
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.570
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing social about that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end consequences two fold.</v>

24
00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're making complete fools of ourselves</v>

25
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>that narcissism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that indulgence is embarrassing,</v>

26
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.450
<v Speaker 1>and in the long run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to regret it both as a</v>

27
00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:38.560
<v Speaker 1>species and individually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we look back at those absurd photos</v>

28
00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:42.190
<v Speaker 1>of herself where we're shamelessly</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposing,</v>

29
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own self importance,</v>

30
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.520
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be severely embarrassed</v>
<v Speaker 1>by it.</v>

31
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.940
<v Speaker 1>But secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also reflects the reality of the</v>

32
00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the individual.</v>

33
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not about the social and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet is alienating,</v>

34
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.300
<v Speaker 1>isolating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fragmenting ourselves.</v>

35
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.600
<v Speaker 1>It's weakening community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's of course the reason why it</v>

36
00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:06.640
<v Speaker 1>hasn't generated real political</v>
<v Speaker 1>movements.</v>

37
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.480
<v Speaker 1>It creates explosions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Arab spring occupy,</v>

38
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.030
<v Speaker 1>but no legacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no political parties,</v>

39
00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:16.360
<v Speaker 1>no movements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no real foundations of political change.</v>
