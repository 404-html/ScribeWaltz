6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.450
<v Speaker 1>for a company and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

15
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.390
<v Speaker 1>You have to order in pizza and beer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>soda and whatever else it is until you</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
