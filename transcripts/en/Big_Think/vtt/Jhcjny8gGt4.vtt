1
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think</v>

2
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.220
<v Speaker 2>since we're always much more complicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>than heather positioned,</v>

3
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.610
<v Speaker 2>facebook has done a brilliant job of</v>
<v Speaker 2>opening up to third party applications.</v>

4
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.410
<v Speaker 2>The issue isn't opening up its platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

5
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 2>It has more to do with the individual's</v>
<v Speaker 2>user graph or social graph if you like,</v>

6
00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:36.190
<v Speaker 2>which is who their friends are and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start doing that you run into these</v>

7
00:00:36.191 --> 00:00:37.570
<v Speaker 2>privacy issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

8
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.460
<v Speaker 2>it's fine for me to decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can find out all about me,</v>

9
00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:45.310
<v Speaker 2>but as it fine for me to let you see who</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my friends are.</v>

10
00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Maybe my friends don't want to be known</v>
<v Speaker 2>as my friends and so I shouldn't</v>

11
00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:54.790
<v Speaker 2>necessarily have the right to reveal who</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my friends are.</v>

12
00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 2>One we'll use hypothetical example is</v>
<v Speaker 2>suppose I'm gay and suppose I'm</v>

13
00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 2>sensitive about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know</v>

14
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.800
<v Speaker 2>in theory you shouldn't even be</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitive about it because it's okay,</v>

15
00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:11.530
<v Speaker 2>but some people are are they have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their work or whatever,</v>

16
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.000
<v Speaker 2>and so if I have friends on my favorite</v>
<v Speaker 2>lesbian site,</v>

17
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.950
<v Speaker 2>they might not want me to open up my</v>
<v Speaker 2>social graph to all my friends on</v>

18
00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 2>facebook who could then say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

19
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.530
<v Speaker 2>well that's interesting.</v>

20
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Esther has all these gay friends so</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get outed by their association</v>

21
00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

22
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a very complicated thing and I may</v>
<v Speaker 2>have my own reasons for not wanting</v>

23
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.720
<v Speaker 2>certain people to know certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I may have</v>

24
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.570
<v Speaker 2>an ex boyfriend that I don't want to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain things about my new boyfriend</v>

25
00:01:46.571 --> 00:01:50.350
<v Speaker 2>because rather than hating him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to make him jealous,</v>

26
00:01:50.351 --> 00:01:52.270
<v Speaker 2>I still like him or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>

27
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Or I may not want my mother to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures of my stepmother.</v>

28
00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Not Because of privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because of a certain delicacy.</v>

29
00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have my own reasons for wanting to</v>

30
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.140
<v Speaker 2>control this information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not quote privacy,</v>

31
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's not something where I want even</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friends to plaster my information all</v>

32
00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:13.900
<v Speaker 2>over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

33
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.150
<v Speaker 2>it's a complicated thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What facebook did so brilliantly was</v>

34
00:02:19.151 --> 00:02:20.050
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

35
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.380
<v Speaker 2>we're not so much a single community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're way too large to be a community.</v>

36
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.550
<v Speaker 2>We are a platform on which people can</v>
<v Speaker 2>build communities,</v>

37
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.030
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to be a public utility.</v>

38
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.630
<v Speaker 2>We want to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>proprietary.</v>

39
00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:42.631
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately moneymaking utility and</v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiating those shows is really tough</v>

40
00:02:44.951 --> 00:02:49.840
<v Speaker 2>and facebook hasn't done it without a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of errors on the way,</v>

41
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.530
<v Speaker 2>but there are basic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what,</v>

42
00:02:53.531 --> 00:02:57.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who should have done and failed to do.</v>

43
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Facebook is doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're pioneering and they're,</v>

44
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're learning by trial and error and</v>

45
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 2>every little errors being</v>
<v Speaker 2>viciously.</v>

46
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a million small mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

47
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

48
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.670
<v Speaker 2>the boats were all going by facebook</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumped on and one of them and then</v>

49
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.400
<v Speaker 2>turned it into a much bigger boat.</v>
