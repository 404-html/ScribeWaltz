1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.460
<v Speaker 1>There is a pattern to the introduction</v>
<v Speaker 1>of technologies.</v>

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.750
<v Speaker 1>When Gutenberg invented the press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.560
<v Speaker 1>some of the earliest authors were</v>
<v Speaker 1>frightened of having their words and</v>

4
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>thoughts set down permanently</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed widely.</v>

5
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Swift said that a book of</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus kept in a drawer showed only to</v>

6
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:14.720
<v Speaker 1>friends was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

7
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fine lasts,</v>

8
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.380
<v Speaker 1>but once printed as a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a common whore and you want</v>

9
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:20.460
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can buy for two crown.</v>

10
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Fast forward to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

11
00:00:22.911 --> 00:00:26.010
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prior kind of moral panic we've had</v>

12
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:29.220
<v Speaker 1>about privacy came because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology in the year 1890,</v>

13
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>the first major law review article</v>
<v Speaker 1>written by Louis Brandeis and said go</v>

14
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.830
<v Speaker 1>warren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tried to look for a legal basis to a</v>

15
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>right to privacy in the United States</v>
<v Speaker 1>was inspired by the invention of a</v>

16
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kodak Camera,</v>

17
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>and that caused some measure of moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>panic and fear.</v>

18
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.930
<v Speaker 1>The New York Times at the time has</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about fiendish.</v>

19
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Kodak is lying in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

20
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:54.530
<v Speaker 1>a young vanderbilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a horse horsewhip,</v>

21
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.310
<v Speaker 1>a Kodak or a president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teddy Roosevelt outlawed Kodak,</v>

22
00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 1>him in Washington parks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what happened?</v>

23
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got used to cameras,</v>

24
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're happy to pose in front of them as</v>

25
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>I am right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

26
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>and what really went on there was that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new technology caused a change that our</v>

27
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>norms weren't ready for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And until such time as we had new norms,</v>

28
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:17.850
<v Speaker 1>we had new agreements about how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>operate as a society around this were</v>

29
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>unsettled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're afraid of what could go wrong.</v>

30
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's happening with the</v>

31
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Internet with a much bigger technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is.</v>

32
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 1>It's causing new opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's causing change.</v>

33
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:30.681
<v Speaker 1>It also causes fear and disruption and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes even a moral panic,</v>

34
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 1>which is what I think we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>through now.</v>

35
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Privacy matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Privacy is important.</v>

36
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 1>That needs protectors.</v>

37
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I have a private life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that is true,</v>

38
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>but we also have this magnificent tool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the publicness,</v>

39
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>the Internet in all of our hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can find form and act as publix now</v>

40
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:49.950
<v Speaker 1>in ways that we couldn't before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a magnificent ability and my fear</v>

41
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>is that if governments come in to</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulate,</v>

42
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 1>the net will lose some of that power and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them want us to lose that power</v>

43
00:01:56.911 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 1>because they fear that power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think we have to be aware of</v>

44
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>demonizing technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like tracking cookies,</v>

45
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>being bad for us or worried about</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology first off,</v>

46
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>because we're walking into the hands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who would limit the technology</v>

47
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.310
<v Speaker 1>rather than what we should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What society is long done is you</v>

48
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:19.311
<v Speaker 1>regulate the behaviors so you can use a</v>
<v Speaker 1>telephone to do good things and Simon</v>

49
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>someone an ambulance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could use it to do bad things into</v>

50
00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

51
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.510
<v Speaker 1>the technology isn't bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the behavior we regulate.</v>

52
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Yet nowadays we're seeing efforts by</v>
<v Speaker 1>governments to come in and regulate on</v>

53
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:34.530
<v Speaker 1>the whole the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even Canada and Australia want to</v>

54
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.980
<v Speaker 1>filter all the content on the net to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pedophilia.</v>

55
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they create an ability and an</v>

56
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>architecture that also Iran and China</v>
<v Speaker 1>will use.</v>

57
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.940
<v Speaker 1>We have to be aware of that.</v>
