<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2
00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:06.660
<v Speaker 1>the movies like Gandhi inspired me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>chariots of fire,</v>

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Smith goes to Washington by Jimmy</v>

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Stewart was a great inspirational movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>about politics.</v>

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>It had a tremendous impact on it,</v>

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.980
<v Speaker 1>two of the greatest movies that probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>have ever been produced in terms of</v>

8
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>total thing.</v>
