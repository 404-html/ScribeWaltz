1
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Here's why I wrote big guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had served in Congress for 16 years</v>

2
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>and in those 16 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.630
<v Speaker 1>I witnessed a shooting at a university</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Virginia shooting at a movie theater</v>

4
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>in Aurora,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado,</v>

5
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>shooting at a nightclub in Orlando,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting at an elementary school,</v>

6
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Connecticut.</v>

7
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>And after every single one of those mass</v>
<v Speaker 1>shootings,</v>

8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>I in virtually every one of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues were confronted with the same</v>

9
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is when is congress going to do</v>

10
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>something about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When will this stop?</v>

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily when we'll converse to</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything about it,</v>

12
00:00:44.431 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>but just do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do universal background checks or,</v>

13
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some common sense legislation.</v>

14
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>And when my constituents in New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>would ask that question,</v>

15
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>I knew that the honest answer and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>painful answer was we're not,</v>

16
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.490
<v Speaker 1>congress is not going to do anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the politics that surrounded</v>

17
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>the gun safety debate.</v>

18
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>And I decided to try and answer that</v>
<v Speaker 1>question in the best way I can.</v>

19
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.160
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.880
<v Speaker 1>with snark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>with humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from the very inside of Congress,</v>

22
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I wrote this book during hearings on gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>safety.</v>

23
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>I wrote this book on the floor of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>House of Representatives.</v>

24
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>I wrote this book on that little balcony</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the floor of the House of</v>

25
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Representatives where members go to rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they're not beating each other up,</v>

26
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>

27
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.160
<v Speaker 1>And so this book is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's reflection of what I learned as a</v>

28
00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 1>member of Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is my way of explaining to</v>

29
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:41.181
<v Speaker 1>readers why Congress seems so paralyzed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the face of this mass violence,</v>

30
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is affecting so many communities.</v>

31
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>And so many of our constituents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90% of the American people support</v>

32
00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:52.611
<v Speaker 1>strengthened background checks of about</v>
<v Speaker 1>80% of Republicans support,</v>

33
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 1>strengthened background checks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A majority of NRA members support</v>

34
00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>strengthened background checks.</v>

35
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>And yet when we offered this amendment</v>
<v Speaker 1>for stronger background checks and the</v>

36
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>appropriations committee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was defeated,</v>

37
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually in a party line vote.</v>

38
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>And I was wrestling with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would members of Congress vote</v>

39
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>against something that has such massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>support?</v>

40
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned the lesson and the lesson is</v>

41
00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>reflected in big guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>

42
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:17.663
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing,</v>

43
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to one of the most sacred places,</v>

44
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Capitol Hill,</v>

45
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.040
<v Speaker 1>not a church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

46
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>but the members only elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that's sacred,</v>

47
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 1>it's because on the members only</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevator,</v>

48
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>you can't have tourists and can't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the media in,</v>

49
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>can't have staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

50
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 1>and so you reach a real level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidentiality in that cramped space.</v>

51
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>And a bunch of members piled onto this</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevator after the committee meeting and</v>

52
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>one of the Republicans on this elevator</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

53
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:45.850
<v Speaker 1>why did you try and force us to vote</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

54
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this amendment for background</v>

55
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:48.324
<v Speaker 1>checks?</v>

56
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.931
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

57
00:02:48.931 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>we didn't force you to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You voted against it.</v>

58
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.380
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my question to you is,</v>

59
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>why would you vote against it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this member looked at me and said,</v>

60
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to vote for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't go home and explain that</v>

61
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>vote to my gun lobby voters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be the end of my career.</v>

62
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>That tells you everything you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know about why Congress seems so</v>

63
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>paralyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just say one other thing on this.</v>

64
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>After every mass shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire country has galvanized.</v>

65
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>They want to mobilize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

66
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>think about what happened after park</v>
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>

67
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

68
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 1>it was so certain that Congress was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to pass something.</v>

69
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>There were rallies and marches and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 1>everybody was talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now we're months from Parkland and</v>

71
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>what does Congress done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

72
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>I wrote this book.</v>

73
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.470
<v Speaker 1>So Congress people will be reminded that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the solution to this is in the congress</v>

74
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>and they have to keep pressuring their</v>
<v Speaker 1>members of Congress to pass meaningful</v>

75
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 1>reforms that will make our kids safer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not want to write big guns as my</v>

76
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 1>personal screed against the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the NRA and the gun lobby.</v>

77
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought the best and most credible way</v>

78
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>of writing this book was to bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>different characters in with different</v>

79
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

80
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 1>that's what congress is like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different characters with different</v>

81
00:03:56.981 --> 00:03:58.080
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

82
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>and I felt that the best way to tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>this story a was as a satire.</v>

83
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all set tire has to be based on a kernel</v>

84
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:09.150
<v Speaker 1>of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the truth in this book is that the</v>

85
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.480
<v Speaker 1>fact that Congress does nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book was actually based on a and</v>

86
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.510
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary and a shocking event after</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sandy Hook massacre that,</v>

87
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that killed children in this elementary</v>

88
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 1>school in Connecticut.</v>

89
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.290
<v Speaker 1>I was reading a sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having breakfast right after that.</v>

90
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:30.730
<v Speaker 1>I was so convinced that we in Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're finally going to do something when</v>

91
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 1>first graders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

92
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 1>our gun down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would seem that Congress would do</v>

93
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:39.170
<v Speaker 1>something and my confidence was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>high and I was having breakfast and I</v>

94
00:04:39.171 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 1>was reading my New York Times one</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and I came upon this article,</v>

95
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I could have sworn that the New York</v>

96
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Times had been infiltrated by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>writers of the onion.</v>

97
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it seems so bizarre.</v>

98
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>The story was that while most state and</v>
<v Speaker 1>local governments were actually passing</v>

99
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 1>local ordinances for gun safety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Congress would do nothing,</v>

100
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 1>the small city of Nelson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Georgia decided that they would go in a</v>

101
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:06.220
<v Speaker 1>different direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This small city passed a local ordinance</v>

102
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>requiring that every resident of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>city must possess a firearm.</v>

103
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 1>And that was my kernel of truth.</v>

104
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 1>And when I saw that I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first I had to figure out whether it was</v>

105
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 1>actually true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I realized that it was</v>

106
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided to build a satire round.</v>

107
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 1>This only instead of making it a</v>
<v Speaker 1>applicable to one small city in Georgia,</v>

108
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.940
<v Speaker 1>I federalized it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

109
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I create this law that requires that</v>
<v Speaker 1>every American must own a firearm,</v>

110
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that works its way through congress.</v>

111
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had just written about the process,</v>

112
00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 1>it would be a maybe a slightly lighter</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of the congressional record,</v>

113
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 1>still very boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I decided I had to weave into it</v>

114
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:49.420
<v Speaker 1>real characters and I had to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the characters express different</v>

115
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:53.350
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints because the gun debate is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philly is influenced by so many</v>

116
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 1>different viewpoints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

117
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>so it was important to me that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>story reflect both sides of the issue,</v>
