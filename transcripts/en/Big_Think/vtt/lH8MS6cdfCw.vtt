1
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.513
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.640
<v Speaker 2>turkeys are a tough animal to cook</v>
<v Speaker 2>poetry in general,</v>

3
00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:09.100
<v Speaker 2>and it's because there are two types of</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle in Turkey,</v>

4
00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:12.640
<v Speaker 2>there's the breast meat and the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a fast twitch muscle,</v>

5
00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 2>that's the breast meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.540
<v Speaker 2>that's the muscle that's used for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight or flight.</v>

7
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.880
<v Speaker 2>The adrenaline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that the muscles at the Turkey</v>

8
00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:20.620
<v Speaker 2>doesn't use very often during its</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifetime.</v>

9
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Then there's the slow twitch muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are the legs,</v>

10
00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:25.300
<v Speaker 2>that dark meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm slow twitch muscle has a lot more</v>

11
00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:28.240
<v Speaker 2>connective tissue in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it needs to be cooked to a higher</v>

12
00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:31.090
<v Speaker 2>temperature in order to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that connective tissue breaks down.</v>

13
00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:32.860
<v Speaker 2>So typically when you're roasting a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey,</v>

14
00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:36.160
<v Speaker 2>you want the breast meat to come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>around 150 degrees or so,</v>

15
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.290
<v Speaker 2>and you want the leg meat to come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>around at least 165 to 175 degrees.</v>

16
00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.780
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the issue is the same bird to</v>

17
00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:44.500
<v Speaker 2>different temperatures.</v>

18
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.810
<v Speaker 2>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way people typically cook a Turkey</v>

19
00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:48.100
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll put it in a roasting pan,</v>

20
00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 2>like in Iraq with a roasting pan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was kind of high sides.</v>

21
00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:53.770
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually the worst way you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can possibly cook a Turkey because that</v>

22
00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:56.140
<v Speaker 2>roasting pan is heavy metal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has these high sides,</v>

23
00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:58.210
<v Speaker 2>that kind of shield the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bird,</v>

24
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.880
<v Speaker 2>which is where the legs are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shields it from the heat of the oven.</v>

25
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.780
<v Speaker 2>So your breast ends up overcooking far</v>
<v Speaker 2>before your legs are done.</v>

26
00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why so many people have dry</v>

27
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:10.240
<v Speaker 2>Turkey breast meat on thanksgiving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the easiest way to deal with this</v>

28
00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are all sorts of tricks.</v>

29
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:15.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm like flipping the bird upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm turning it while it's in the oven,</v>

30
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.560
<v Speaker 2>icing down the breast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're separating it into parts.</v>

31
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.510
<v Speaker 2>I find the easiest way to do it is to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>butterfly to spatchcock the bird.</v>

32
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.460
<v Speaker 2>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can either do that yourself with a</v>

33
00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:26.680
<v Speaker 2>pair of poultry shears or you can ask</v>
<v Speaker 2>your butcher to do it for you.</v>

34
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea is you cut out the backbone</v>

35
00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 2>of the bird and then you kind of splay</v>
<v Speaker 2>its legs out in this kind of</v>

36
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.080
<v Speaker 2>pornographic way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

37
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.140
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and press down on the breasts so that</v>

38
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.630
<v Speaker 2>the whole Turkey lies flat with all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the skin on top.</v>

39
00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:41.260
<v Speaker 2>And what you end up with there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find that the breast then becomes</v>

40
00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:43.090
<v Speaker 2>sort of the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thickest part of the,</v>

41
00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:43.631
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

42
00:01:43.631 --> 00:01:44.261
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Turkey.</v>

43
00:01:44.261 --> 00:01:47.170
<v Speaker 2>While the legs lie a little bit flatter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the legs are exposed to more heat.</v>

44
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.930
<v Speaker 2>The breast gets a little bit less heat</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he goes into a little bit more</v>

45
00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:53.830
<v Speaker 2>slowly because it's so thick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so naturally it ends up cooking</v>

46
00:01:53.831 --> 00:01:54.250
<v Speaker 2>perfectly.</v>

47
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.650
<v Speaker 2>By the time your breast meat hits 150</v>
<v Speaker 2>degrees in the center,</v>

48
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.920
<v Speaker 2>your legs are like one 75.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the meat comes out perfectly.</v>

49
00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:02.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm using this method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can also cook a much higher heat and</v>

50
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.560
<v Speaker 2>cook much faster so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can cook a 12 pound Turkey in like</v>

51
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.830
<v Speaker 2>45 minutes to an hour using this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about half the time it takes to</v>

52
00:02:08.831 --> 00:02:10.250
<v Speaker 2>cook a traditional Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

53
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.030
<v Speaker 2>and then finally it also has all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that skin,</v>

54
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.440
<v Speaker 2>all the skin gets exposed to the heat of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the oven so you get really nice crispy</v>

55
00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:20.170
<v Speaker 2>brown skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the only disadvantage to it is that,</v>

56
00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:23.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it ends up looking like a,</v>

57
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.660
<v Speaker 2>like a legs spread apart Turkey when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it to the table.</v>

58
00:02:25.661 --> 00:02:28.240
<v Speaker 2>But I always carve it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the kitchen in Britain and serve it</v>

59
00:02:28.241 --> 00:02:29.080
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And plus,</v>

60
00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:30.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would take good tasting Turkey over</v>

61
00:02:30.971 --> 00:02:32.470
<v Speaker 2>great looking Turkey any day.</v>
