1
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.420
<v Speaker 1>I would like the American political</v>
<v Speaker 1>process to change.</v>

2
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how or when or just don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know how that would happen or how it's</v>

3
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 1>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we have this two party</v>

4
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>system that is serving the two party</v>
<v Speaker 1>system and companies,</v>

5
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>big companies in America and to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>detriment of,</v>

6
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.550
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the supposedly populous of America that</v>

7
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.970
<v Speaker 1>is supposedly the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 1>who the government is supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>serving.</v>

9
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>And I also think they environment is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a big issue.</v>

10
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just reading about green</v>

11
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:45.200
<v Speaker 1>accounting this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 1>which is basically trying to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>the environment into the balance sheet</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>

14
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.340
<v Speaker 1>on a corporate level so that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>a so that if you,</v>

15
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

16
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.450
<v Speaker 1>the example was if you chopped down a</v>
<v Speaker 1>redwood tree to make a picnic table,</v>

17
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Speaker 1>like for the picnic table maker that</v>
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>

18
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:03.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>it has an effect on their bottom line is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has an effect on the US GDP.</v>

20
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.700
<v Speaker 1>But what effect does that have on people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would normally use that redwood in</v>

21
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:16.220
<v Speaker 1>its natural sort of environment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

22
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>we have all this wealth that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's essentially being created from</v>

23
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean from the energy of the sun,</v>

24
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>both pretty much from the energy of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sun and the energy,</v>

26
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.120
<v Speaker 1>the earth and through people sweat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

27
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>And you have all these companies making</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this money,</v>

28
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from nature.</v>

29
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>But I think the balance sheet is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>uneven in that regard.</v>

30
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 1>We're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're giving enough back</v>

31
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>and at some point we're gonna find</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in,</v>

32
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>in trouble as far as not having enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet to live on.</v>

33
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps.</v>
