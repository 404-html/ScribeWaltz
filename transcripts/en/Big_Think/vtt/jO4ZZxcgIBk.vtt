00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.740
<v Speaker 1>I would love someone else when they see</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and not only say it's beautiful,</v>

2
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.380
<v Speaker 1>but hopefully to say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the experience went beyond that.</v>

3
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because beauty in the art world</v>

4
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>particularly let's say in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the kind of academic world is,</v>

5
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.440
<v Speaker 1>is a dismissive term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

6
00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:39.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially would mean a decorative.</v>

7
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.390
<v Speaker 1>And I</v>
<v Speaker 1>say to students,</v>

8
00:00:46.391 --> 00:00:47.230
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

9
00:00:47.231 --> 00:00:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I hate to tell you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could make it as rigorous as you</v>

10
00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:53.920
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make it as theoretical as you</v>

11
00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:54.754
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

12
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.223
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

13
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>don't make it that hermetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let other people in,</v>

14
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>

15
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>who are you talking to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just want to talk to yourself.</v>

16
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>You want to talk to a few art</v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals or as Barnett Newman said,</v>

17
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>do you want to hit the ball out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>field?</v>

18
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I think that's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is a really important part</v>

19
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>of being an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

20
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>I always had a sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I was talking to</v>

21
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.150
<v Speaker 1>in my work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who my audience was.</v>

22
00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>It was always very limited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the voices in our head.</v>

23
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>We all have voices in our head and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I mean by the kind of,</v>

24
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight of consciousness,</v>

25
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>who those voices are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they change over the years.</v>

26
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:51.291
<v Speaker 1>They change sometimes in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those voices a matter of fact,</v>

27
00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:57.510
<v Speaker 1>most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately those voices are very</v>

28
00:01:57.511 --> 00:02:02.511
<v Speaker 1>harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say render really,</v>

29
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.753
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

30
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.670
<v Speaker 1>very astringent criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know which any artist will tell you that</v>

31
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're their own worst critic.</v>

32
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to read criticism to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's wrong with my work.</v>

33
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Does not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never a critic who said something bad</v>

34
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>about my work that I didn't disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I disagreed with</v>

35
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.970
<v Speaker 1>because I knew when I read it</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I could do it better.</v>

36
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I've read good things,</v>

37
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.570
<v Speaker 1>it kind of upsets me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

38
00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:44.280
<v Speaker 1>It's just the way I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're talking to students,</v>

39
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:45.061
<v Speaker 1>you tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>when the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do whatever you want,</v>

41
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't let these terms and don't let</v>

42
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:51.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

43
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the academic part of being an artist,</v>

44
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>the kind of graduate mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the graduate school,</v>

45
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppress you because that's exactly why</v>

46
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.050
<v Speaker 1>you became an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

47
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.690
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a peeling back of layers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

48
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>it's hopefully a path to some kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of liberation,</v>

49
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.463
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

50
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>some kind of map of how you could find</v>
<v Speaker 1>your way out of the,</v>

51
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.070
<v Speaker 1>what I consider the unnecessary</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering</v>

52
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 1>that goes on in a lot of our minds all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
