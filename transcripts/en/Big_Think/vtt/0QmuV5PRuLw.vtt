00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.233
<v Speaker 1>Scott schuman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sartorialist what made me want to </v>

2
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:12.864
<v Speaker 1>work in fashion when I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played sports like all the regular </v>

3
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.953
<v Speaker 1>kids in the Midwest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boys in the Midwest and a would read </v>

4
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>sports illustrated and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read all that,</v>

5
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>all the athletes that I liked and kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading that,</v>

6
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.940
<v Speaker 1>what they were spending their money on </v>
<v Speaker 1>cars and music and fashion.</v>

7
00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:36.260
<v Speaker 1>And so I'd start picking up those </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazines and like,</v>

8
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.103
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ended up becoming more interested in </v>

9
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:40.330
<v Speaker 1>fashion than I did sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>and the better I addressed the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention they seem to get from women,</v>

11
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>which was more attention than what I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting on the football field.</v>

12
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Blogging part was pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.703
<v Speaker 1>I had an idea for the Sartorialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea of mixing photographs of guys </v>

14
00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:59.620
<v Speaker 1>that I knew were stylish with guys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew were fashionable,</v>

15
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.750
<v Speaker 1>which are two different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.793
<v Speaker 1>but I only really knew about websites at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that time and I knew that a website </v>

17
00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:06.334
<v Speaker 1>would take too much time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too many other people would have to be </v>

18
00:01:08.231 --> 00:01:09.760
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

19
00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:10.594
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I happened to be going through the </v>

20
00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:13.204
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a blog just happened to click </v>

21
00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:20.200
<v Speaker 1>onto a blog and I'm the kind of person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that once I see something interesting,</v>

22
00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:21.034
<v Speaker 1>I just started hitting all the buttons </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out how they're doing </v>

23
00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:23.374
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was an interior design blog </v>

24
00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:26.530
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

25
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.480
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had like 30 comments,</v>

26
00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:29.314
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had some good visuals up and once I </v>

27
00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:35.080
<v Speaker 1>saw that I was able to look at it in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract enough way to be able to say,</v>

28
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could do this with my photographs,</v>

29
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that once I figured out how she was </v>

30
00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:42.430
<v Speaker 1>doing it and how simple it was to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

31
00:01:42.431 --> 00:01:45.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the format I want to do.</v>

32
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there weren't really any,</v>

33
00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:48.064
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of definitely I don't think any </v>

34
00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:53.500
<v Speaker 1>street style blogs maybe face hunter was</v>
<v Speaker 1>right about that time.</v>

35
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.030
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't really know it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

36
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.300
<v Speaker 1>But I saw the potential of using,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.153
<v Speaker 1>a blog as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a visual format as opposed to with </v>

38
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.843
<v Speaker 1>just text driven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least I think most of the blogs at </v>

39
00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:07.540
<v Speaker 1>that time were very text driven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they had a little bit of visual,</v>

40
00:02:07.541 --> 00:02:10.690
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't very important where for me I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

41
00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:11.524
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this would be a great way to put </v>

42
00:02:11.891 --> 00:02:12.724
<v Speaker 1>photographs up and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then put a little bit of text to </v>

43
00:02:14.681 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 1>create a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm,</v>

44
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.630
<v Speaker 1>the simplicity is what made the blogging</v>
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>

45
00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:22.690
<v Speaker 1>So the simplicity and the interaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the audience,</v>

46
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.390
<v Speaker 1>with the two things I think made it most</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>

47
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>The difference between what's designers </v>
<v Speaker 1>create or,</v>

48
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're creating a little world every </v>

49
00:02:33.711 --> 00:02:34.790
<v Speaker 1>season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 1>head to toe a full look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.440
<v Speaker 1>a head shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bags,</v>

52
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.710
<v Speaker 1>dresses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing more street fashion is,</v>

53
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people were really wearing.</v>

54
00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:45.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an element of new,</v>

55
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:48.710
<v Speaker 1>there's an element of previous seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's um,</v>

56
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.300
<v Speaker 1>your own history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:02:50.301 --> 00:02:54.020
<v Speaker 1>your sweatshirt from highschool and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vintage pieces.</v>

58
00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:54.854
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that kind of combination that I </v>

59
00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>find so much more interesting than just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the runway.</v>

60
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.731
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

61
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>and I love fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love going to the runway shows.</v>

62
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.433
<v Speaker 1>for me a shopping trip is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the appreciation of the craft of </v>

64
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>design geniuses,</v>

66
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who come up with beautiful color </v>

67
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>combinations and beautiful proportion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

68
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 1>suggestions and these kinds of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

69
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>I look at the runway shows in a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>

70
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a romantic,</v>

71
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.903
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic interpretation of how they </v>

72
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:25.774
<v Speaker 1>would like to see fashion going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me it's much more abstract of </v>

73
00:03:30.121 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>runways shows are much more abstract </v>
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

74
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what ends up on people as much more real</v>

75
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:36.034
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

76
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

77
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Realistically a fashion insider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

78
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>I was in the business 15 years before I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started the blog,</v>

79
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 1>even though it was in a different part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the business,</v>

81
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.144
<v Speaker 1>it was in sales and marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the people that I've met since I've </v>

82
00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 1>been doing the blog did I know really </v>
<v Speaker 1>beforehand,</v>

83
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 1>but I knew about the business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how I really came up with the.</v>

85
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:00.841
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I think part of what I do is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>photography.</v>

87
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I think that's half of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I'm able to,</v>

88
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.320
<v Speaker 1>I learned how to be able to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in the romantic way that I see</v>

89
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

90
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.670
<v Speaker 1>but then the other half of it is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>editing,</v>

91
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I choose to shoot and not so much </v>

92
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:17.434
<v Speaker 1>because of the drama and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>overdramatic nature of the way they're </v>

93
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 1>dressed.</v>

94
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very subtle,</v>

95
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.153
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my background and tailoring and pattern </v>

96
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:29.120
<v Speaker 1>making and pattern making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

97
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I think really helped me understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:32.490
<v Speaker 1>the subtleties of a suits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:04:32.491 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 1>and why a guy can look great looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>very subtle in a suit.</v>

100
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what really separates</v>
<v Speaker 1>me is um,</v>

101
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a real understanding of actual </v>

102
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:44.710
<v Speaker 1>clothes and how they work and how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should fit and you know,</v>

103
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.010
<v Speaker 1>a reasonably good artistic version of </v>
<v Speaker 1>photography that kind of captures that.</v>

104
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:50.990
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

105
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>that was really the kind of the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>combination,</v>

106
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 1>a different screen fashion and style is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fashion is,</v>

107
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

108
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.883
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing that's happening at that </v>

109
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

110
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it might be point issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it might be heels,</v>

111
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.523
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it might be flats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where style I think is something that's </v>

112
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 1>always there in your own personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>wardrobe,</v>

113
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:16.770
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a Navy Cardigan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

114
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.640
<v Speaker 1>reading glasses like this.</v>

115
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's different for everybody.</v>

116
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.233
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's version of style is totally </v>

117
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:24.304
<v Speaker 1>different and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think keeps me going out </v>

118
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:26.824
<v Speaker 1>on the street every day is going out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of seeing the variations and what </v>

119
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Speaker 1>things maybe I had never seen in quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way that I find very curious in how</v>

120
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 1>people will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

121
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.920
<v Speaker 1>be able to communicate their own persona</v>
<v Speaker 1>through their clothing,</v>

122
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.860
<v Speaker 1>their posture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they wear their hair.</v>

123
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.373
<v Speaker 1>I think all those elements end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming very interesting because I </v>

125
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 1>don't think I'm really particularly a </v>
<v Speaker 1>people person.</v>

126
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for me,</v>

127
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it's interesting to kind of be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to read people in that way.</v>

128
00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.533
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite cities to shoot a Milan in </v>

129
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Italy obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

130
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 1>the guys look great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The women look great.</v>

131
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 1>There's an old school romance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

132
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:12.800
<v Speaker 1>it feels like Italy in the 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:13.634
<v Speaker 1>the guys at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the bar still were beautiful white </v>

134
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:18.460
<v Speaker 1>dinner jackets and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 1>there's a formality there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

136
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if it's 90 degrees in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the summer,</v>

137
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

138
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.303
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killer hot and in Milan and the guy </v>

139
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.953
<v Speaker 1>still put on their jackets to leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>their office to go get lunch and bring </v>

140
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:32.810
<v Speaker 1>it back to the office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd never see that in America.</v>

141
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Guys barely can put on their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:37.360
<v Speaker 1>their shirts to go to the office or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 1>keep their tie done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

144
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 1>so I think there's a romance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:41.624
<v Speaker 1>that they're willing to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and enjoy that formality that they've </v>

146
00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 1>created.</v>

147
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 1>They're in Milan and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 1>all across Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but especially in Milan.</v>

149
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 1>So I love that formality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

150
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.233
<v Speaker 1>after about a week that I've had enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that and I'm ready to go to Paris </v>

151
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:58.960
<v Speaker 1>where it's more sexy and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

152
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.170
<v Speaker 1>a more dramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more challenge,</v>

153
00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:03.004
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of how they put things </v>

154
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:04.960
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

155
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.973
<v Speaker 1>and then back to America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really love being able to go to those </v>

156
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 1>three different places and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in America were so much more sporty,</v>

157
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:13.880
<v Speaker 1>so much more color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much more,</v>

158
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.830
<v Speaker 1>so much more difference in the way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we talk about our style and way we exude</v>

159
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:25.270
<v Speaker 1>our style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have in,</v>

160
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 1>like in Milan for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

161
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.300
<v Speaker 1>they're very narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:30.134
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody dresses in a few certain ways </v>

163
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 1>and they have beautiful variations on </v>
<v Speaker 1>those few kind of styles.</v>

164
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.050
<v Speaker 1>But in America there's million different</v>
<v Speaker 1>styles,</v>

165
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.360
<v Speaker 1>know rocker and vintage and sporty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>preppy.</v>

166
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.213
<v Speaker 1>And so I like that variation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one without the other is not nearly </v>

167
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:46.184
<v Speaker 1>as interesting.</v>

168
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:49.693
<v Speaker 1>I've been to Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was very interested in </v>

169
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Beijing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

170
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.213
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted to go there more and 2010 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of my big challenges is </v>

171
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.170
<v Speaker 1>try and make it through Asia more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know.</v>

172
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious to see what I find you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

173
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Japan I think,</v>

174
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.363
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of style and love </v>

175
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.930
<v Speaker 1>subcultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

176
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.210
<v Speaker 1>it'll be interesting to see how much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

177
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.553
<v Speaker 1>how much of the people wearing those </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes are really expressing something </v>

178
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:20.420
<v Speaker 1>about who they are or who they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

179
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.900
<v Speaker 1>And it will be very interesting to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>

180
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.520
<v Speaker 1>especially once you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you get to a certain city,</v>

181
00:08:28.521 --> 00:08:29.354
<v Speaker 1>like in Stockholm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really get to know the people a </v>

182
00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:32.260
<v Speaker 1>little bit and what they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>through their clothes.</v>

183
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:34.070
<v Speaker 1>You want some more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

184
00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I think it's much more interesting than </v>
<v Speaker 1>just the clothes they're wearing or the,</v>

185
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.540
<v Speaker 1>the length of the skirt.</v>

186
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.900
<v Speaker 1>You start to understand something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that culture,</v>

187
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Rio,</v>

188
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.690
<v Speaker 1>none of the girls have short hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the interviews I did in Rio,</v>

189
00:08:46.691 --> 00:08:48.260
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to find in Rio?</v>

190
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.890
<v Speaker 1>And say the one girl with short hair </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they just don't do it.</v>

191
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.690
<v Speaker 1>And once you get to know them a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>

192
00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:54.524
<v Speaker 1>you realize that all the girls are </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid to cut their hair short because </v>

193
00:08:57.121 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid they're men won't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

194
00:08:59.070 --> 00:08:59.903
<v Speaker 1>So what you think of is a beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural style actually becomes a style </v>

195
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:08.970
<v Speaker 1>out of fear and it kinda changes your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception of it a little bit.</v>

196
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.670
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a or for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Japan,</v>

197
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:12.504
<v Speaker 1>I'm very curious to see who is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something unique and who's just </v>

198
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:15.534
<v Speaker 1>doing something because they've heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way they do it in Florence </v>

199
00:09:17.931 --> 00:09:18.764
<v Speaker 1>and Milan.</v>

200
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by that question,</v>

201
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that an oxymoron?</v>

202
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.093
<v Speaker 1>Trend in classic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we can put those two </v>

203
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:29.160
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

204
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because it's totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>different for everybody.</v>

205
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.091
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

206
00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:34.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Navy Cardigan,</v>

207
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always looks great.</v>

208
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>converse tennis shoes,</v>

209
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just always worked.</v>

210
00:09:40.521 --> 00:09:42.390
<v Speaker 1>But that's for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

211
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.360
<v Speaker 1>and that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least for me,</v>

212
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:46.893
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever really look for trends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking for just what captures my </v>

213
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:50.334
<v Speaker 1>attention at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And rarely do I ever look back and try </v>

214
00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:55.960
<v Speaker 1>and put together trends or say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:09:55.961 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 1>this kind of trend is important for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the individual expression.</v>

216
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.990
<v Speaker 1>And if you go back and look through the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

217
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.400
<v Speaker 1>through the archives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

218
00:10:05.401 --> 00:10:07.260
<v Speaker 1>you might find certain things become </v>
<v Speaker 1>trends,</v>

219
00:10:07.261 --> 00:10:09.270
<v Speaker 1>but it's just not something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly interests me.</v>

220
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Blog took off pretty quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

221
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:17.304
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because I had a particular </v>

222
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:18.960
<v Speaker 1>point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

223
00:10:18.961 --> 00:10:21.300
<v Speaker 1>there's been other street style </v>
<v Speaker 1>photographers,</v>

224
00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Bill Cunningham and the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

225
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:23.784
<v Speaker 1>it was like the godfather of modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>street style photography and other </v>

226
00:10:27.301 --> 00:10:29.370
<v Speaker 1>people historically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think what,</v>

227
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.340
<v Speaker 1>what they had always done was they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>always trying to,</v>

228
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.353
<v Speaker 1>to find the most dramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that you wouldn't see every </v>

229
00:10:36.381 --> 00:10:38.280
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that were really different,</v>

230
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:39.763
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I shot things that people would </v>

231
00:10:41.971 --> 00:10:42.804
<v Speaker 1>aspire to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that maybe they would see </v>

232
00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:45.174
<v Speaker 1>every day but didn't really know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between something done well </v>

233
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:48.294
<v Speaker 1>and something not done as well as suit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fits a guy really well as opposed </v>

234
00:10:51.061 --> 00:10:53.710
<v Speaker 1>to just another suit or dress the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

235
00:10:53.711 --> 00:10:55.320
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fits a woman beautifully.</v>

236
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Or the way that she's put this </v>
<v Speaker 1>combination of,</v>

237
00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

238
00:10:58.410 --> 00:10:59.850
<v Speaker 1>for an open toe shoe.</v>

239
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two totally separate kind of ideas.</v>

240
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:04.170
<v Speaker 1>And yet she's put them together in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you go,</v>

241
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:04.591
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

242
00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:06.490
<v Speaker 1>that does look really great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

243
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.150
<v Speaker 1>so I think it took off now because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting the incredibly different.</v>

244
00:11:09.151 --> 00:11:09.984
<v Speaker 1>But because I was shooting something </v>
<v Speaker 1>people could relate to a lot of </v>

245
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:14.910
<v Speaker 1>different people could relate to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

246
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there was one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one particular thing that made me say,</v>

247
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:20.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really becoming popular.</v>

248
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.330
<v Speaker 1>But for me it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

249
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.533
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these really heartfelt emails that we </v>

250
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:27.000
<v Speaker 1>get from people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

251
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.613
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that meant something to them that they </v>

252
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:31.920
<v Speaker 1>could look at these pictures and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

253
00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:34.680
<v Speaker 1>I look like that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't look like him yet,</v>

254
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to look like him.</v>

255
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:37.551
<v Speaker 1>I'm big like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

256
00:11:37.551 --> 00:11:38.384
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little chubby like him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he looks great and he's dressed </v>

257
00:11:42.031 --> 00:11:43.170
<v Speaker 1>better in his clothes than I am.</v>

258
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:47.220
<v Speaker 1>So I know these guys were printing these</v>
<v Speaker 1>photographs up and taken it to Nordstrom</v>

259
00:11:47.221 --> 00:11:49.920
<v Speaker 1>or saks or dillard's or wherever and </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

260
00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:53.860
<v Speaker 1>help me look like this and would be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to achieve it because it was never in my</v>

261
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:56.200
<v Speaker 1>blog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About how expensive it is,</v>

262
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost,</v>

263
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.210
<v Speaker 1>if you look at most of the guys that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really well dressed,</v>

264
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 1>it's just the attention to detail and </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody can do that,</v>

265
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:05.944
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just taking it to alterations in </v>

266
00:12:06.731 --> 00:12:07.564
<v Speaker 1>getting the right amount of cuff and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these little things that aren't about </v>

267
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.760
<v Speaker 1>the expense but just not the attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>to detail.</v>

268
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:16.683
<v Speaker 1>I think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic situation is affected in the </v>

269
00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:20.231
<v Speaker 1>sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:21.064
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people that have money always </v>
<v Speaker 1>have money and they're still buying and </v>

271
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:25.324
<v Speaker 1>they're still shopping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just not talking about it when </v>

272
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:28.570
<v Speaker 1>we go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I go to fashion week,</v>

273
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:29.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are still wearing new things and </v>

274
00:12:30.851 --> 00:12:31.684
<v Speaker 1>they're still shopping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think they feel a little more </v>

275
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:37.000
<v Speaker 1>guilty when they've had to left five </v>
<v Speaker 1>people go from the company and not bring</v>

276
00:12:37.001 --> 00:12:39.160
<v Speaker 1>to people that usually go to Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Europe.</v>

277
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.353
<v Speaker 1>So they're still shopping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just not talking about it that </v>

278
00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:43.260
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

279
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

280
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:49.840
<v Speaker 1>helped people find a romance in shopping</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their own closet.</v>

281
00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:50.674
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

282
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.570
<v Speaker 1>going back and looking at the clothes </v>
<v Speaker 1>they already have.</v>

283
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Because we've become so such consumers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think people kind of forget,</v>

284
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

285
00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.413
<v Speaker 1>what humongous closets we have full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more close than what they could ever </v>

286
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:03.250
<v Speaker 1>wear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like maybe,</v>

287
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:04.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open people's eyes again,</v>

288
00:13:04.901 --> 00:13:05.734
<v Speaker 1>it's really looking at what they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>and kind of re engineering it and </v>

289
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.780
<v Speaker 1>reworking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's good.</v>

290
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was in the business for 15 years.</v>

291
00:13:15.521 --> 00:13:16.354
<v Speaker 1>My ex wife was a designer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to show room where I worked with </v>

292
00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:19.564
<v Speaker 1>young designers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was very familiar with what </v>

293
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:23.763
<v Speaker 1>designers look for when they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>out to look for inspiration and they're </v>

294
00:13:26.591 --> 00:13:27.760
<v Speaker 1>not looking for trends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

295
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:30.550
<v Speaker 1>if it's something that's already out on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the street now that's a trend now.</v>

296
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:33.610
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be something they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to design for a year from now.</v>

297
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.810
<v Speaker 1>It's usually much more abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it might be a detail,</v>

298
00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:38.644
<v Speaker 1>it might be color combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be even the way that the </v>

299
00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:44.110
<v Speaker 1>posture of a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

300
00:13:44.111 --> 00:13:49.111
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>designers look at my site is a,</v>

301
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.630
<v Speaker 1>not specifically the pieces that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting,</v>

302
00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.490
<v Speaker 1>but I think they may be looking at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl and think,</v>

303
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:55.001
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

304
00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:59.200
<v Speaker 1>I love the way that girl looks and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would never dress like that,</v>

305
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:00.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that girl inspires me.</v>

306
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:01.960
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

307
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.793
<v Speaker 1>I love the idea of a long dress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she was wearing a long dress and </v>

308
00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:05.220
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

309
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.053
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a long time since I've </v>

310
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.013
<v Speaker 1>designed a long dress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would never put it in a floral </v>

311
00:14:10.481 --> 00:14:11.980
<v Speaker 1>print.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do it this way.</v>

312
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.250
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think they're looking at my </v>
<v Speaker 1>site for specific inspiration.</v>

313
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Like they're looking at an abstract way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get them thinking about that customer</v>

314
00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:21.573
<v Speaker 1>and that girl and that kind of girl that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would like to dress and how they would </v>

315
00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:26.410
<v Speaker 1>do it a little bit differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

316
00:14:26.411 --> 00:14:27.244
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think that's probably the most </v>

317
00:14:28.841 --> 00:14:30.160
<v Speaker 1>realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or even the guys,</v>

318
00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:32.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of the designers take a lot</v>

319
00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:33.064
<v Speaker 1>of those old guy pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take these kind of really stylish old </v>

320
00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:39.370
<v Speaker 1>guys and I know it's not because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifics clothes that they're wearing,</v>

321
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:40.533
<v Speaker 1>but it's the posture and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude and it's the elegance of these </v>

322
00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:47.410
<v Speaker 1>guys that is attracting them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that inspires them.</v>

323
00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.500
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

324
00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally inspired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I want to dress like an 80</v>

325
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:54.320
<v Speaker 1>year old Milanesa guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

326
00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:55.163
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they can still carry </v>

327
00:14:57.051 --> 00:14:58.740
<v Speaker 1>themselves with such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

328
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.860
<v Speaker 1>such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

329
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:01.693
<v Speaker 1>an elegance even at that age I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very inspiring and whether it's Milan </v>

330
00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:06.530
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Harlem or wherever,</v>

331
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.263
<v Speaker 1>I think that's something that guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>really key on a lot of the designers </v>

332
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:13.650
<v Speaker 1>key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on a,</v>

333
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.660
<v Speaker 1>when I'm shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try and keep it just very easy,</v>

334
00:15:17.661 --> 00:15:20.720
<v Speaker 1>very unplanned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

335
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:23.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm just walking around on the street </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for somebody that uh,</v>

336
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.673
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it looks cool and then it might </v>

337
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.210
<v Speaker 1>be able to get a good shot.</v>

338
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:30.973
<v Speaker 1>Today I was at Jamba juice and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a very cool girl and I'm very </v>

339
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:36.590
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a young college girl and you know,</v>

340
00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:40.940
<v Speaker 1>she had great coat and a little again </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a port trim and another print dress</v>

341
00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:41.774
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing that she was wearing was </v>

342
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.273
<v Speaker 1>expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all kind of thrown together but </v>

343
00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:45.890
<v Speaker 1>don't together just right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:48.320
<v Speaker 1>the color combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How cute she looked.</v>

345
00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:50.840
<v Speaker 1>She was very kind of charming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though she was a tall girl,</v>

346
00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:55.010
<v Speaker 1>she had a very kind of small persona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very kind of shy persona.</v>

347
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.290
<v Speaker 1>And all of that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

348
00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:59.090
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the persona that she's creating,</v>

349
00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:01.940
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a big dramatic one or quiet</v>
<v Speaker 1>shy one,</v>

350
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.193
<v Speaker 1>I'm the way they stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of that is something that you want </v>

351
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:06.644
<v Speaker 1>to try and capture in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least my perception of who that </v>

352
00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:11.720
<v Speaker 1>person is in the photograph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

353
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:13.610
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

354
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:14.990
<v Speaker 1>you never know where you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet these people.</v>

355
00:16:14.991 --> 00:16:15.890
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

356
00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:19.850
<v Speaker 1>that's why I enjoy going out and getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost,</v>

357
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully every day or every other day </v>

358
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.180
<v Speaker 1>and just seeing what's out there because</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the end of the day I usually get back</v>

359
00:16:26.181 --> 00:16:27.080
<v Speaker 1>to my office and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

360
00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.330
<v Speaker 1>I never would've thought I'd run into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of person.</v>

361
00:16:29.331 --> 00:16:31.820
<v Speaker 1>They are doing that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

362
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:32.803
<v Speaker 1>by constantly challenging myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I think keeps the integrity </v>

363
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.240
<v Speaker 1>and the sincerity of the blog.</v>

364
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had too many people.</v>

365
00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:43.334
<v Speaker 1>I mean people turn me down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I've gotten pretty good at </v>

366
00:16:45.111 --> 00:16:47.360
<v Speaker 1>being able to tell who will probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned me down,</v>

367
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:48.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being able to read people a little </v>

368
00:16:49.671 --> 00:16:50.061
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

369
00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:52.440
<v Speaker 1>if someone's walking really fast and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like they probably have some where</v>

370
00:16:52.441 --> 00:16:53.274
<v Speaker 1>they're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't get too many people that are </v>

371
00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:57.250
<v Speaker 1>upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

372
00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.753
<v Speaker 1>I did have someone who was in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background of one of my pictures that I </v>

373
00:17:01.581 --> 00:17:04.670
<v Speaker 1>put up like two weeks ago and it totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>unrelated,</v>

374
00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.020
<v Speaker 1>just happened to be walking by on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>

375
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:09.440
<v Speaker 1>but he just happened to be looking just </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the right moment at the subject I was</v>

376
00:17:09.441 --> 00:17:10.274
<v Speaker 1>taking a picture of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so email me today a feeling that </v>

377
00:17:13.611 --> 00:17:16.480
<v Speaker 1>maybe he should be compensated for being</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that picture and,</v>

378
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.353
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

379
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:18.763
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least a big print or something </v>

380
00:17:20.091 --> 00:17:21.710
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought that was a little bit odd.</v>

381
00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

382
00:17:23.601 --> 00:17:24.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot too many,</v>

383
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.293
<v Speaker 1>too many weird or bad stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been beaten up or chased or </v>

384
00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:29.684
<v Speaker 1>anything yet.</v>

385
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.870
<v Speaker 1>A Guy Ron story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dot for,</v>

386
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just because she's my girlfriend,</v>

387
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:42.770
<v Speaker 1>but I do truly think that she's got the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best women's fashion blog in the world.</v>

388
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her point of view is great.</v>

389
00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.101
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

390
00:17:46.101 --> 00:17:47.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her writing is great,</v>

391
00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.650
<v Speaker 1>photography is Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her,</v>

392
00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.493
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that she communicates to her </v>

393
00:17:52.411 --> 00:17:56.040
<v Speaker 1>reader is brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way she writes and the ability to be</v>

394
00:17:56.041 --> 00:18:00.420
<v Speaker 1>that stylish and that fashionable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet that approachable.</v>

395
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real challenge,</v>

396
00:18:03.241 --> 00:18:04.074
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to do that and do it </v>

397
00:18:04.471 --> 00:18:07.320
<v Speaker 1>consistently every day because you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake it.</v>

398
00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:10.140
<v Speaker 1>She's doing a lot of things that other </v>
<v Speaker 1>blogs just aren't doing,</v>

399
00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>graphically.</v>

400
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that make it really interesting.</v>

401
00:18:14.071 --> 00:18:14.904
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my blogs doing very well at my audience </v>

402
00:18:16.891 --> 00:18:17.724
<v Speaker 1>is bigger than hers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are days when I look at her </v>

403
00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:20.244
<v Speaker 1>blog and I'm totally jealous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally pissed that she hasn't told me </v>

404
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.600
<v Speaker 1>how she did some of those things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:28.540
<v Speaker 1>just little technical things to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shots look great or you know,</v>

406
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.420
<v Speaker 1>how she's laying them out on the page or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

407
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.240
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

408
00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a good kind of challenging </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

409
00:18:33.961 --> 00:18:36.810
<v Speaker 1>but I think she probably does better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than anybody else right now.</v>

410
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:43.290
<v Speaker 1>And I hate her for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

411
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:44.100
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

412
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:44.933
<v Speaker 1>with magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never really looked at them that </v>

413
00:18:45.691 --> 00:18:46.524
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

414
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:48.540
<v Speaker 1>being someone who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

415
00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:51.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm a self taught photographer and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught myself photography,</v>

416
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:52.950
<v Speaker 1>just looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking,</v>

417
00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:54.360
<v Speaker 1>looking at the magazines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

418
00:18:54.361 --> 00:18:55.410
<v Speaker 1>to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them,</v>

419
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hardly ever read,</v>

420
00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:59.910
<v Speaker 1>you don't really look at their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what their real fashion opinion is.</v>

421
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me it's always been very abstract,</v>

422
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

423
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

424
00:19:06.121 --> 00:19:08.700
<v Speaker 1>I can't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love my fashion magazines,</v>

425
00:19:08.701 --> 00:19:09.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times I get a question,</v>

426
00:19:09.961 --> 00:19:10.794
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think blogs will replace fashion </v>

427
00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:13.194
<v Speaker 1>magazines?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hope not because I love my Gq and </v>

428
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.823
<v Speaker 1>vogue in Paris vogue and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I look at them less now just </v>

429
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:20.784
<v Speaker 1>because I've started to develop my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>photographic style that I'm very </v>

430
00:19:24.301 --> 00:19:25.560
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

431
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:26.993
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really are the ones that taught me </v>

432
00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.380
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of how I wanted to shoot.</v>

433
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it almost everyone in Hollywood,</v>

434
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everyone in the record business.</v>

435
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

436
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:44.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be honest,</v>

437
00:19:44.791 --> 00:19:48.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know.</v>

438
00:19:48.421 --> 00:19:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm not much of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

439
00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:51.390
<v Speaker 1>I maybe said this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not much of a people person,</v>

440
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in doing my blog.</v>

441
00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.170
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the few places where being </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly selfish,</v>

442
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.780
<v Speaker 1>it's actually very positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

443
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.290
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm taking a picture of someone,</v>

444
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.970
<v Speaker 1>like I don't really put their names </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

445
00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:09.630
<v Speaker 1>rarely do I put the people's names down </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's just not that important,</v>

446
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking a picture of someone.</v>

447
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.413
<v Speaker 1>It's my perception of who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking it by the way I'm taking it </v>

448
00:20:15.691 --> 00:20:17.580
<v Speaker 1>because it's some I want to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at.</v>

449
00:20:17.581 --> 00:20:18.414
<v Speaker 1>I want to enjoy the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's my selfishness that's actually </v>

450
00:20:20.851 --> 00:20:22.670
<v Speaker 1>very generous in the sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

451
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:23.543
<v Speaker 1>I share the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to take a nice picture of </v>

452
00:20:24.751 --> 00:20:25.584
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm doing it for totally selfish </v>

453
00:20:26.251 --> 00:20:27.084
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

454
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.103
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I think people </v>
<v Speaker 1>misunderstand on the blog is just </v>

455
00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:33.390
<v Speaker 1>because I take a picture of someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean they have great personal</v>

456
00:20:33.391 --> 00:20:34.201
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

457
00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:36.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them I've never met before.</v>

458
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

459
00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:41.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's just one thing and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>look that I really love and that's all I</v>

460
00:20:41.071 --> 00:20:46.071
<v Speaker 1>want to focus on and I try and shoot it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that highlights that.</v>

461
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:47.543
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

462
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:49.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really have a lot of people and </v>

463
00:20:50.911 --> 00:20:51.744
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not judgmental that way and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that sincerity comes through in </v>

464
00:20:54.191 --> 00:20:54.761
<v Speaker 1>the blog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

465
00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:56.230
<v Speaker 1>to me it really doesn't matter who they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

466
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.333
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I don't want to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in Hollywood or models or </v>

467
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.030
<v Speaker 1>musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

468
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.930
<v Speaker 1>if I ran into 20 musicians in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll look great,</v>

469
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:07.420
<v Speaker 1>I'd shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that just rarely ever happens.</v>

470
00:21:07.421 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't really fall into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

471
00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:11.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for me,</v>

472
00:21:11.681 --> 00:21:13.570
<v Speaker 1>it's much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more abstract.</v>

473
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

474
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:18.214
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony Randall on the odd couple always </v>

475
00:21:20.351 --> 00:21:22.510
<v Speaker 1>looked great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always thought he looked really cool.</v>

476
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:28.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Jay fashion's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed much in the last five years.</v>

477
00:21:28.181 --> 00:21:29.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system is the system,</v>

478
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:30.713
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was really going to change in a </v>

479
00:21:33.131 --> 00:21:34.870
<v Speaker 1>major way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now would have been the time to do it.</v>

480
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many companies are closing,</v>

481
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.910
<v Speaker 1>but they're not really changing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>method of how they do it.</v>

482
00:21:39.911 --> 00:21:43.510
<v Speaker 1>They're jumping on the new hot thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is right now.</v>

483
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:44.890
<v Speaker 1>It's blogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

484
00:21:44.891 --> 00:21:47.230
<v Speaker 1>who knows what's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be next holograms or whatever.</v>

485
00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:48.563
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of companies are </v>

486
00:21:50.111 --> 00:21:51.040
<v Speaker 1>closing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is great.</v>

487
00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I think we're way too oversaturated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too many brands,</v>

488
00:21:53.891 --> 00:21:56.530
<v Speaker 1>too many stores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too many labels.</v>

489
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

490
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was going to change now would be </v>

491
00:22:01.091 --> 00:22:03.010
<v Speaker 1>the time to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not really changing that much.</v>

492
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Shipping's not changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

493
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.230
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a time when,</v>

494
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:09.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it actually gets cold is when </v>

495
00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.830
<v Speaker 1>winter clothes hit the store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

496
00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:12.693
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to the winter clothes hit the</v>
<v Speaker 1>store always on the hottest day in </v>

497
00:22:15.671 --> 00:22:17.680
<v Speaker 1>August is when all the winter clothes </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit.</v>

498
00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:19.203
<v Speaker 1>So I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of technology and because of </v>

499
00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:25.630
<v Speaker 1>this kind of speed of digital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

500
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:27.870
<v Speaker 1>digital internet and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

501
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.690
<v Speaker 1>it will change soon because smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>designers,</v>

502
00:22:31.691 --> 00:22:35.320
<v Speaker 1>young designers are going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start showing their collection in a much</v>

503
00:22:35.321 --> 00:22:40.321
<v Speaker 1>wider audience and ship those products </v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to the real time.</v>

504
00:22:40.691 --> 00:22:43.090
<v Speaker 1>They won't need vogue and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>other places.</v>

505
00:22:43.091 --> 00:22:47.230
<v Speaker 1>They have to work so far in advance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>promote their fashion because they'll be</v>

506
00:22:47.231 --> 00:22:48.064
<v Speaker 1>able to do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know themselves through the </v>

507
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to their audience.</v>

508
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:52.870
<v Speaker 1>And be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

509
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.273
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ship the close accordingly to that </v>

510
00:22:56.141 --> 00:22:56.590
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

511
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's very,</v>

512
00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.233
<v Speaker 1>a day very soon where you'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get some kind of digital printout of </v>

513
00:23:02.801 --> 00:23:05.330
<v Speaker 1>your body and have the clothes made for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your shape.</v>

514
00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.920
<v Speaker 1>There'll be a new age of tailoring and </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

515
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:09.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely more than five years </v>

516
00:23:10.601 --> 00:23:11.434
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's a really far </v>

517
00:23:12.461 --> 00:23:13.294
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

518
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:14.283
<v Speaker 1>I think it's definitely in the near </v>
<v Speaker 1>future and that will really change </v>

519
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.910
<v Speaker 1>fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fashion system,</v>

520
00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:20.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sense that,</v>

521
00:23:20.681 --> 00:23:21.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

522
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.613
<v Speaker 1>you won't just have all this excess of </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes and things shift so early </v>

523
00:23:25.481 --> 00:23:27.280
<v Speaker 1>because you need x amount of time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell.</v>

524
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully it'll become much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient,</v>

525
00:23:28.931 --> 00:23:29.764
<v Speaker 1>much more effective if you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>making clothes that fit people in </v>

526
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:32.733
<v Speaker 1>clothes that people are ordering and </v>
<v Speaker 1>want as opposed to trying to guess what </v>

527
00:23:35.621 --> 00:23:40.621
<v Speaker 1>they might want my readers or are </v>
<v Speaker 1>located a everywhere.</v>

528
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.653
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I knew about </v>

529
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:44.583
<v Speaker 1>doing a photo driven blog was that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have to read English to be able </v>

530
00:23:48.171 --> 00:23:49.880
<v Speaker 1>to enjoy the photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

531
00:23:49.881 --> 00:23:54.370
<v Speaker 1>there were elements of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it for the fashion content.</v>

532
00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:55.563
<v Speaker 1>There is an element of people that kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like to live vicariously through all </v>

533
00:23:58.671 --> 00:24:00.430
<v Speaker 1>these different crazy places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

534
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.150
<v Speaker 1>there's an element that likes to share </v>
<v Speaker 1>their fashion idea.</v>

535
00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:04.761
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

536
00:24:04.761 --> 00:24:05.594
<v Speaker 1>they had always dreamed of becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion designer and moving to New York </v>

537
00:24:09.051 --> 00:24:11.150
<v Speaker 1>or Milan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason,</v>

538
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:13.730
<v Speaker 1>a family reason or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't able to do that.</v>

539
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.520
<v Speaker 1>So they're stuck in Wisconsin or </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever they are.</v>

540
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.690
<v Speaker 1>And this is their chance to kind of be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that community a little bit,</v>

541
00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:22.490
<v Speaker 1>share their comments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at fashion,</v>

542
00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.970
<v Speaker 1>share it with an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an audience.</v>

543
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.843
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we're very proud of is</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been able to create an audience </v>

544
00:24:27.861 --> 00:24:29.480
<v Speaker 1>that's respectful that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

545
00:24:29.481 --> 00:24:31.250
<v Speaker 1>you can talk about your fashion ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you like,</v>

546
00:24:31.251 --> 00:24:32.940
<v Speaker 1>what you don't like in a respectful for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

547
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so with that said,</v>

548
00:24:35.751 --> 00:24:37.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all over the place.</v>

549
00:24:37.521 --> 00:24:38.354
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I know is right now when I travel </v>

550
00:24:39.231 --> 00:24:41.780
<v Speaker 1>and I do these book tours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know we always get a really,</v>

551
00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:43.310
<v Speaker 1>really good turnout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a very,</v>

552
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.690
<v Speaker 1>a very varied audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

553
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:46.730
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

554
00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.750
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

555
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.070
<v Speaker 1>rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor.</v>

556
00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very much looks like,</v>

557
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:53.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

558
00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:55.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>photographs of my blog photographs in my</v>

559
00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:57.110
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something I'm very proud of.</v>

560
00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.990
<v Speaker 1>New York has changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed a lot,</v>

561
00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been here almost 20 years.</v>

562
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:08.480
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe when I first moved here,</v>

563
00:25:08.481 --> 00:25:10.670
<v Speaker 1>people have said I'd be a horrible place</v>
<v Speaker 1>to raise kids.</v>

564
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:14.040
<v Speaker 1>And now I think everyone would agree </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty good place to raise kids.</v>

565
00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:15.750
<v Speaker 1>It's clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

566
00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.070
<v Speaker 1>a modern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

567
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:24.080
<v Speaker 1>I travel around a lot and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still think New York looks great,</v>

568
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:25.190
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>

569
00:25:25.191 --> 00:25:26.540
<v Speaker 1>There's new buildings going up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new.</v>

570
00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:29.440
<v Speaker 1>It's different kinds of architecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

571
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:30.283
<v Speaker 1>there's just always something happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I hate to sound like such a Yankees </v>

572
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's such a New York fan.</v>

573
00:25:33.771 --> 00:25:34.604
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

574
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:38.270
<v Speaker 1>I still can't think of anywhere else I'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather live than here.</v>

575
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Shoot from the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>

576
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.910
<v Speaker 1>I think that actually just stopped at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shoot from the heart.</v>

577
00:25:46.911 --> 00:25:47.744
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

578
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.040
<v Speaker 1>would be the best year I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

579
00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.240
<v Speaker 1>it really doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

580
00:25:53.241 --> 00:25:54.074
<v Speaker 1>I like to take good quality photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to try and have the light a </v>

581
00:25:56.201 --> 00:25:58.040
<v Speaker 1>certain way and the person's standards </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>

582
00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:00.230
<v Speaker 1>even though it's all very natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens very quickly.</v>

583
00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I worked very quickly and work with what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm given.</v>

584
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:03.873
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really pose the people or </v>

585
00:26:05.151 --> 00:26:05.984
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of worked with who I think </v>

586
00:26:07.431 --> 00:26:08.264
<v Speaker 1>that person is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I think I'm the honesty of it </v>

587
00:26:12.231 --> 00:26:16.010
<v Speaker 1>is I think people like to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>vicariously.</v>

588
00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the whole idea of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality TV.</v>

589
00:26:17.841 --> 00:26:18.674
<v Speaker 1>They like to live vicariously through </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people and see other people's </v>

590
00:26:21.051 --> 00:26:23.840
<v Speaker 1>ideas and other people's take on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

591
00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.860
<v Speaker 1>So whether you're taking it with just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little digital camera,</v>

592
00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.053
<v Speaker 1>if you're actually taking pictures that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean something to you in a real way and </v>

593
00:26:33.201 --> 00:26:36.770
<v Speaker 1>you actually have something to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will follow that blog,</v>

594
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'll find likeminded people.</v>

595
00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by doing that,</v>

596
00:26:42.561 --> 00:26:44.780
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things that separates</v>
<v Speaker 1>me is,</v>

597
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't shoot just all 20 year old </v>

598
00:26:46.951 --> 00:26:47.784
<v Speaker 1>hipsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

599
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.550
<v Speaker 1>old and young and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

600
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:52.163
<v Speaker 1>that brand comes across in the variety </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people I shoot because I actually </v>

601
00:26:54.931 --> 00:26:55.764
<v Speaker 1>have something to say and I can do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to saying one thing over and </v>

602
00:26:58.831 --> 00:26:59.664
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives me a wider vocabulary to be </v>

603
00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:02.844
<v Speaker 1>able to shoot people in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways and a lot of different </v>

604
00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:07.410
<v Speaker 1>types of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you always know it's one of my shots</v>

605
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.450
<v Speaker 1>and that's because you to take it very </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

606
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.740
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have a real passionate about,</v>

607
00:27:11.741 --> 00:27:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I have a real point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

608
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:17.190
<v Speaker 1>so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

609
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:18.023
<v Speaker 1>that's what someone has to do before </v>
<v Speaker 1>just deciding that I think I want to go </v>

610
00:27:20.701 --> 00:27:23.190
<v Speaker 1>out and take pictures of people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street and like they really have to have</v>

611
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:24.520
<v Speaker 1>a point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

612
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.900
<v Speaker 1>it's very important what I don't shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to what I do.</v>

613
00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:28.734
<v Speaker 1>Shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people in the fashion </v>

614
00:27:29.311 --> 00:27:31.480
<v Speaker 1>business I've never shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

615
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.710
<v Speaker 1>so without a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real passionate point of view,</v>

616
00:27:34.711 --> 00:27:37.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do because then it just becomes a,</v>

617
00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.413
<v Speaker 1>a report on product and there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>blogs like that and I think they're </v>

618
00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.800
<v Speaker 1>incredibly boring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

619
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:46.500
<v Speaker 1>just a report of what's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do anything for me.</v>

620
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>passion and a point of view,</v>

621
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.610
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistency.</v>

622
00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:54.883
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to create a </v>

623
00:27:55.891 --> 00:28:00.060
<v Speaker 1>consistent voice because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>blogging in a real way,</v>

624
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:00.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

625
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to do it very </v>
<v Speaker 1>regularly.</v>

626
00:28:03.811 --> 00:28:04.644
<v Speaker 1>If it's not five days a week or six days</v>
<v Speaker 1>a week in a way that people start to </v>

627
00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:10.290
<v Speaker 1>know when they can come see your blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

628
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.573
<v Speaker 1>when there's going to be new images up </v>
<v Speaker 1>that always doesn't have to be exactly </v>

629
00:28:15.001 --> 00:28:16.520
<v Speaker 1>the same time every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

630
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:17.363
<v Speaker 1>it's not so bad to keep them guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so bad to have him coming back </v>

631
00:28:18.901 --> 00:28:19.734
<v Speaker 1>once or twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there has to be consistency in the </v>

632
00:28:21.451 --> 00:28:24.990
<v Speaker 1>voice because you just can't fake it </v>
<v Speaker 1>five days a week.</v>

633
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think that's really important.</v>

634
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think next generation of blogs,</v>

635
00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:35.190
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be just like the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what websites,</v>

636
00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:36.024
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could kind of do it on your own and </v>

637
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:40.560
<v Speaker 1>kind of habit and it didn't look great </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily,</v>

638
00:28:40.561 --> 00:28:41.130
<v Speaker 1>but now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

639
00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:44.070
<v Speaker 1>blogs are getting very sophisticated and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

640
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:47.040
<v Speaker 1>I think people are going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really start to be serious about the way</v>

641
00:28:47.041 --> 00:28:47.940
<v Speaker 1>the blog looks.</v>

642
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:48.840
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

643
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.230
<v Speaker 1>the days I think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

644
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.413
<v Speaker 1>just being able to steal images from all</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the place to put them on your blog </v>

645
00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:57.960
<v Speaker 1>and just putting another two cents in on</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else's conversation.</v>

646
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:59.063
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty close to over because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blog is not gonna be able to grow that </v>

647
00:29:01.531 --> 00:29:02.364
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The blog is only going to be able to </v>

648
00:29:03.361 --> 00:29:05.970
<v Speaker 1>grow once you're in control of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>

649
00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:09.810
<v Speaker 1>And like that's why street style blogs </v>
<v Speaker 1>have grown so quickly is,</v>

650
00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:10.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in control of the visuals were in </v>

651
00:29:12.511 --> 00:29:14.100
<v Speaker 1>control of the writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

652
00:29:14.101 --> 00:29:15.840
<v Speaker 1>if you're using a particular kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>blog,</v>

653
00:29:15.841 --> 00:29:19.290
<v Speaker 1>you can be more in control of the ponds </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the graphics and everything else.</v>

654
00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really do anything.</v>

655
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

656
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.000
<v Speaker 1>at least for me anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm,</v>

657
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so many different things.</v>

658
00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:32.040
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the clothes themselves,</v>

659
00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:34.140
<v Speaker 1>it's the person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

660
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:36.503
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

661
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.260
<v Speaker 1>I just have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

662
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.550
<v Speaker 1>that's the artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

663
00:29:38.551 --> 00:29:40.970
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could say as a marketer,</v>

664
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're wearing this brand and blah,</v>

665
00:29:43.391 --> 00:29:44.224
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

666
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.260
<v Speaker 1>that will make it really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

667
00:29:47.261 --> 00:29:48.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the artist in me,</v>

668
00:29:48.281 --> 00:29:50.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you meet someone and it's just</v>

669
00:29:50.351 --> 00:29:51.370
<v Speaker 1>something that clicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

670
00:29:51.371 --> 00:29:52.204
<v Speaker 1>and it might be an obvious kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty or a non obvious kind of beauty </v>

671
00:29:56.171 --> 00:29:57.410
<v Speaker 1>or just something that you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

672
00:29:57.411 --> 00:30:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I shut this woman in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Barcelona the other day,</v>

673
00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:03.900
<v Speaker 1>this beautiful older woman and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

674
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:09.750
<v Speaker 1>really beautifully aged face and very </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly done hair and fur coat.</v>

675
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:10.743
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was definitely not typical </v>

676
00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.750
<v Speaker 1>traditional beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was just something so charming</v>

677
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.740
<v Speaker 1>about her and I don't think she'd ended </v>
<v Speaker 1>up on anybody else's blog,</v>

678
00:30:20.741 --> 00:30:21.574
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that is definitely part of my </v>

679
00:30:23.201 --> 00:30:24.034
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure she didn't get up that day </v>

680
00:30:26.171 --> 00:30:27.004
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should I wear to be shocked by the </v>

681
00:30:27.731 --> 00:30:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Sartorialist I know he's in town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

682
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:31.811
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

683
00:30:31.811 --> 00:30:32.800
<v Speaker 1>that's the fun of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

684
00:30:32.801 --> 00:30:34.930
<v Speaker 1>you just never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people I see all the time that</v>

685
00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.430
<v Speaker 1>you would think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

686
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.293
<v Speaker 1>maybe be on the blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I don't feel something and don't </v>

687
00:30:40.031 --> 00:30:42.310
<v Speaker 1>feel that I'm going to be able to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>it the way that I want,</v>

688
00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:45.910
<v Speaker 1>then it doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But all black is pretty boring.</v>

689
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.753
<v Speaker 1>You're going gonna do all black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better do some good proportion or </v>

690
00:30:49.001 --> 00:30:51.580
<v Speaker 1>texture or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Color pattern,</v>

691
00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:52.443
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually real elements of design </v>

692
00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:57.460
<v Speaker 1>are always a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good place to start.</v>

693
00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:04.510
<v Speaker 1>My heroes are my mom and dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

694
00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:07.923
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think just anyone that succeeds at </v>

695
00:31:10.601 --> 00:31:15.601
<v Speaker 1>what they do through really trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something unique and difference and uh,</v>

696
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:21.820
<v Speaker 1>interesting something that maybe not the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people told them would never work.</v>

697
00:31:21.821 --> 00:31:23.900
<v Speaker 1>But that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

698
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.390
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

699
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.990
<v Speaker 1>says something about who they are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they saw something differently.</v>

700
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.770
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

701
00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:30.970
<v Speaker 1>and it's a bunch of different things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

702
00:31:30.971 --> 00:31:33.190
<v Speaker 1>the guys that do the Mac computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

703
00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:35.080
<v Speaker 1>that design for the Mac computers I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think are great.</v>

704
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they'd be a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but someone I definitely look up to,</v>

705
00:31:37.931 --> 00:31:39.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take that chance of saying,</v>

706
00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do them in color now.</v>

707
00:31:42.131 --> 00:31:45.490
<v Speaker 1>And then knowing as someone that used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work in the fashion business,</v>

708
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:46.563
<v Speaker 1>how tough that is to go to the stores </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say we want you to buy these </v>

709
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:51.820
<v Speaker 1>computers in color now and that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to come back and say,</v>

710
00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:52.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to buy?</v>

711
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what percentage,</v>

712
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:56.680
<v Speaker 1>but what color and what computer and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

713
00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Some that has such a passion for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and is willing to really,</v>

714
00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.213
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go through all the steps and be able to </v>

715
00:32:03.461 --> 00:32:06.040
<v Speaker 1>sell that concept to somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

716
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's designing the Mac computer,</v>

717
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:10.060
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Armani and the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

718
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.790
<v Speaker 1>doing completely different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>design for women.</v>

719
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

720
00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:15.843
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Weber kind of figuring out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot people in a wholesome but sexy </v>

721
00:32:20.651 --> 00:32:21.461
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

722
00:32:21.461 --> 00:32:25.660
<v Speaker 1>those are the people that look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm most inspired by in terms of</v>

723
00:32:25.661 --> 00:32:29.980
<v Speaker 1>their work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ethical dilemma.</v>

724
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was an ethical dilemma,</v>

725
00:32:33.641 --> 00:32:34.474
<v Speaker 1>but I did have to figure out how I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>handle having advertising on the blog </v>

726
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.740
<v Speaker 1>because I knew that there would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain people saying,</v>

727
00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:43.131
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

728
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:43.964
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here it goes,</v>

729
00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:44.913
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blogs are going to go downhill because </v>

730
00:32:45.911 --> 00:32:48.570
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna have advertising and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to shoot him.</v>

731
00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.050
<v Speaker 1>American apparel was one of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertisers on the site.</v>

732
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.150
<v Speaker 1>And I was prepared for people to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

733
00:32:54.151 --> 00:32:55.430
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're going to start seeing a lot of</v>

734
00:32:55.431 --> 00:32:58.820
<v Speaker 1>American apparel or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that never happened.</v>

735
00:32:58.910 --> 00:32:59.743
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the sincerity and the integrity </v>

736
00:33:00.591 --> 00:33:01.520
<v Speaker 1>of the blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that,</v>

737
00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:02.763
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was able to have advertising and it's </v>

738
00:33:04.131 --> 00:33:04.964
<v Speaker 1>never affected any of the work on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>site that you never see anything about </v>

739
00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:08.444
<v Speaker 1>American apparel on the site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless it's something that I see in </v>

740
00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:12.340
<v Speaker 1>someone happens to be wearing American </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparel that didn't.</v>

741
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Absolute integrity and sincerity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>still there.</v>

742
00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:19.700
<v Speaker 1>I just shot a big story for Berberi big </v>
<v Speaker 1>ad campaign and I announced it because I</v>

743
00:33:19.701 --> 00:33:23.300
<v Speaker 1>was very proud of the work and showed </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the pictures I really liked from</v>

744
00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:25.070
<v Speaker 1>that project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

745
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.963
<v Speaker 1>probably did three or four posts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't put anything in there </v>

746
00:33:27.561 --> 00:33:28.770
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

747
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.460
<v Speaker 1>where to buy the trenches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no information about it.</v>

748
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I was just showing the photographs I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>very proud of from that project.</v>

749
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.910
<v Speaker 1>And the audience totally understood it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

750
00:33:37.911 --> 00:33:39.350
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

751
00:33:39.351 --> 00:33:40.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

752
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:43.490
<v Speaker 1>I love burberry and that was very happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work with that.</v>

753
00:33:43.491 --> 00:33:47.000
<v Speaker 1>And I think the new reality is sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have a hard time handling.</v>

754
00:33:47.001 --> 00:33:49.010
<v Speaker 1>The new reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

755
00:33:49.011 --> 00:33:50.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

756
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an artist and I'm a,</v>

757
00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:54.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

758
00:33:54.411 --> 00:33:55.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only way you could say it.</v>

759
00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't really consider myself a </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist.</v>

760
00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:58.993
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to sell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to tell you the story of </v>

761
00:34:00.411 --> 00:34:02.180
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just showing you my pictures,</v>

762
00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:03.253
<v Speaker 1>so I feel totally comfortable saying I </v>
<v Speaker 1>love burberry or Ralph Lauren or </v>

763
00:34:05.661 --> 00:34:10.520
<v Speaker 1>whatever because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are things that I like and um,</v>

764
00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.560
<v Speaker 1>so that's know that's hard for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to be able to understand that,</v>

765
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.113
<v Speaker 1>but because it's so consistent and I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been so consistent in how I present </v>

766
00:34:21.111 --> 00:34:26.111
<v Speaker 1>those things and how I let them be </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest themselves on the blog,</v>

767
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.793
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think has been able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the sincerity and keep the </v>

768
00:34:31.401 --> 00:34:33.350
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm believing in what I do.</v>

769
00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:40.420
<v Speaker 1>The worst career advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

770
00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.653
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never really had much career </v>

771
00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:43.453
<v Speaker 1>advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad always gave me great advice and </v>

772
00:34:46.671 --> 00:34:47.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

773
00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:48.380
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

774
00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.131
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say it,</v>

775
00:34:49.131 --> 00:34:49.490
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

776
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't a good corporate person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know everything that,</v>

777
00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:54.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made me horrible.</v>

778
00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Working in incorporation was perfect for</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of job.</v>

779
00:34:56.361 --> 00:34:57.194
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

780
00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:58.423
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never really got bad advice because I </v>

781
00:34:59.871 --> 00:35:04.871
<v Speaker 1>never really asked for any think it'd be</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe like Pablo Picasso.</v>

782
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.480
<v Speaker 1>I think he was probably crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

783
00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:10.370
<v Speaker 1>I know he was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone says he was crazy.</v>

784
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.473
<v Speaker 1>So I think you just wouldn't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>would happen at dinner and I'd love to </v>

785
00:35:13.551 --> 00:35:16.880
<v Speaker 1>talk to them about art and how he </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenged himself and was always trying</v>

786
00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:20.300
<v Speaker 1>to look for a new way of expressing his </v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic,</v>

787
00:35:20.301 --> 00:35:23.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his artistic expression or whatever.</v>

788
00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:24.680
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

789
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.513
<v Speaker 1>I think he also would probably do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something crazy at dinner in and that </v>

790
00:35:27.951 --> 00:35:30.830
<v Speaker 1>would be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe him and Tracy Morgan,</v>

791
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.350
<v Speaker 1>the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

792
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:39.870
<v Speaker 1>I always thought I knew better than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people I was working for.</v>

793
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:41.743
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good thing to think that </v>

794
00:35:45.901 --> 00:35:50.190
<v Speaker 1>you always know better than the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your bosses and and always create a</v>

795
00:35:50.191 --> 00:35:51.024
<v Speaker 1>problem for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always thought I had a good point of </v>

796
00:35:52.351 --> 00:35:53.700
<v Speaker 1>view on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and whatever.</v>

797
00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.550
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

798
00:35:56.551 --> 00:35:57.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point,</v>

799
00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:58.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always created problems for me </v>

800
00:35:59.311 --> 00:36:01.650
<v Speaker 1>working corporately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

801
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.680
<v Speaker 1>so at some point my dad said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

802
00:36:04.681 --> 00:36:07.380
<v Speaker 1>we can't always be them at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be you.</v>

803
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:10.020
<v Speaker 1>You're the only thing that's consistent </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this and that's hard.</v>

804
00:36:10.021 --> 00:36:11.160
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to hear that from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>dad.</v>

805
00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know was probably true and I think</v>

806
00:36:14.341 --> 00:36:17.390
<v Speaker 1>it helped me realize that either I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to put up or shut up and uh,</v>

807
