1
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean we don't have a lot of</v>

2
00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>natural resources as a country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a very beautiful country</v>

3
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>visually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone goes out about green</v>

4
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.060
<v Speaker 1>that's in the mountains and the rivers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's clean and it's not populated.</v>

5
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>It is stunningly beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've no oil.</v>

6
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 1>We've no cold with no money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just have our Ireland,</v>

7
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.760
<v Speaker 1>but we're theory I have is we come from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a suppressed culture.</v>

8
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.800
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

9
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>we're one of the most invaded countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

10
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.870
<v Speaker 1>I think the British started very early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be like $800.</v>

11
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I decided to come and show us at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Danes and the norse and we've had a</v>

12
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 1>tough time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pretty much a similar culture would</v>

13
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.860
<v Speaker 1>be to Jewish culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a pretty hard time,</v>

14
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were being kicked around for a</v>

15
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

16
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>So when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people try to take your culture</v>

17
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:18.741
<v Speaker 1>away from you and your assets of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture becomes stronger,</v>

18
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.490
<v Speaker 1>it's like even in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.620
<v Speaker 1>when you see African Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stronger because of what they've</v>

20
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.003
<v Speaker 1>gone through.</v>

21
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Speaker 1>It's even sublingual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it becomes in the genes,</v>

22
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 1>but our language was even taken from us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

23
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Speaker 1>the Irish Gaelic language was outlawed</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the religion was outlawed,</v>

24
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.680
<v Speaker 1>hence the religion later being stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger to a negative point of view.</v>

25
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our revenge was.</v>

26
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you listen to Irish language,</v>

27
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.750
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very complicated,</v>

28
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's very poetic to say hello and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland is weakest.</v>

29
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Lydia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which translated means sunshine of God</v>

30
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot nicer than hello.</v>

31
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And goodbye as slung Ghanaian Jambo,</v>

32
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 1>her laugh which made it's a wave and may</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road rise,</v>

33
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:18.210
<v Speaker 1>which you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very well known phrase and</v>

34
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:23.211
<v Speaker 1>that's a really nice way to say goodbye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was ingrained poetry.</v>

35
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.260
<v Speaker 1>And then when you look back at our</v>
<v Speaker 1>history in the 20th century,</v>

36
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 1>the last century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the greatest writers of the</v>

37
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:38.361
<v Speaker 1>20th century were Irish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go from Beckett to Joyce to being,</v>

38
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Shaw,</v>

39
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.400
<v Speaker 1>to Oscar Wilde.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just go,</v>

40
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>

41
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>All these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

42
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>and the most famous book in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be ulysses after the Bible.</v>

43
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.010
<v Speaker 1>But that was almost like a revenge on</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dare you take our culture from us.</v>

44
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>So it became our only weapon was our</v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry or music.</v>

45
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.930
<v Speaker 1>And if you listen to Irish music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we've more than say the celts</v>

46
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>came from the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So really I'm an Arab.</v>

47
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>She listened to the way they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

48
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>listen to a similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Sinead O'connor site,</v>

49
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be Muslim,</v>

50
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.090
<v Speaker 1>you know that anx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another layer that whale.</v>

51
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.013
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in our genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think certain stuff is in our genes,</v>

53
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.610
<v Speaker 1>like nobody can dance like a black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the genes so we don't have oil,</v>

54
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:50.191
<v Speaker 1>but we have poetry</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the not very well.</v>

55
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a huge fan of the Celtic tiger.</v>

56
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.490
<v Speaker 1>I was so glad that you could see people</v>
<v Speaker 1>being prosperous and you didn't see</v>

57
00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:04.440
<v Speaker 1>people begging that the city started</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking good,</v>

58
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.470
<v Speaker 1>that people had jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's almost like if you have such a</v>

59
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:14.610
<v Speaker 1>hard time for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you turn around and give a kid a</v>

60
00:04:14.611 --> 00:04:18.000
<v Speaker 1>check for a million quid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to go nuts.</v>

61
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 1>And we went a bit nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went up,</v>

62
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.770
<v Speaker 1>harass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly everyone started sounding very</v>

63
00:04:25.771 --> 00:04:28.530
<v Speaker 1>American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which freaked me at the.</v>

64
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God syndrome kicked in really</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick and I,</v>

65
00:04:32.611 --> 00:04:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I got a fright at the bubble is burst</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

66
00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:39.800
<v Speaker 1>towels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time tells everything we,</v>

67
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.510
<v Speaker 1>we blew it too quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.960
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't totally our fault because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big boys that run those banks,</v>

69
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.090
<v Speaker 1>they messed up America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've missed,</v>

70
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 1>it's up Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've messed up the world.</v>

71
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 1>And really it's the start of the 21st</v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

72
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.250
<v Speaker 1>We've got to rethink things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Socialism and communism don't work but</v>

73
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:07.540
<v Speaker 1>needed a straightforward capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to get a new way of thinking</v>

74
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:10.030
<v Speaker 1>and working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We blew it.</v>

75
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 1>So there was good and bad about about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Celtic tiger.</v>

76
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.630
<v Speaker 1>But we're tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

77
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:18.910
<v Speaker 1>This 4 million in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know what I mean?</v>

78
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>We're tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>4 million in the country and he's in New</v>

79
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.670
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven 10,</v>

80
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

81
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 1>but we're strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully we pulled through and you</v>

82
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 1>never really know until you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective copany years away.</v>

83
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.830
<v Speaker 1>But I really disliked the fact that our</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is what make us.</v>

84
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.760
<v Speaker 1>And made us and will make us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when money came in,</v>

85
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.850
<v Speaker 1>we rejected it so quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even rejected.</v>

86
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.310
<v Speaker 1>We didn't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just got lazy and all the girls</v>

87
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:57.880
<v Speaker 1>started getting fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not good.</v>

88
00:05:57.881 --> 00:05:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
