1
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Civil liberties are inherent human </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

2
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Some people use the terminology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terminology,</v>

3
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.300
<v Speaker 1>natural rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.883
<v Speaker 1>a resonant passage that many people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>relate to is the declaration of </v>

6
00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:26.910
<v Speaker 1>independence with one amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can guess a,</v>

7
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:27.763
<v Speaker 1>when it says all men are created equal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and endowed by their creator with </v>

8
00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:34.850
<v Speaker 1>certain unalienable rights that among </v>
<v Speaker 1>these are life,</v>

9
00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.160
<v Speaker 1>so forth and that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that the purpose of government is to</v>

11
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:40.994
<v Speaker 1>secure these rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that concept is repeated in the </v>

12
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:48.350
<v Speaker 1>preamble to the constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sets forth the purposes of the new</v>

13
00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:49.184
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of them is to secure the </v>

14
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>blessings of liberty to ourselves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>our posterity.</v>

15
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:59.180
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't say to provide liberty,</v>

16
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to grant liberty to bestow it.</v>

17
00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:03.404
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we already are entitled to that by </v>

18
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:06.644
<v Speaker 1>virtue of being born human rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving us liberty government's purpose </v>

19
00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:14.030
<v Speaker 1>is to protect the liberty that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>already have.</v>

20
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Now it's one thing to say that on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really,</v>

21
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all the shortcomings,</v>

22
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.270
<v Speaker 1>I do think it really was an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously we were nowhere close to those</v>

23
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:24.104
<v Speaker 1>ideals when the declaration was panned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet it's so significant that those </v>

24
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:30.560
<v Speaker 1>were the aspirations of this new </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

25
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:31.394
<v Speaker 1>It was the first time in history that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>government was dedicated to those </v>

26
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:38.800
<v Speaker 1>libertarian and egalitarian ideals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hclu,</v>

27
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.290
<v Speaker 1>founders recognize that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>these rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to be self executing,</v>

30
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:46.244
<v Speaker 1>that government officials were not </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily spontaneously going to </v>

31
00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:50.444
<v Speaker 1>fulfill that responsibility to protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's rights rather than suppressing </v>

32
00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:54.854
<v Speaker 1>their rights and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and had this radical idea that they </v>

33
00:01:57.171 --> 00:02:00.290
<v Speaker 1>would actually do what's necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:04.400
<v Speaker 1>to help people who first of all be aware</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what their rights are.</v>

35
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:05.234
<v Speaker 1>And secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do what's necessary to protect them </v>

36
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.400
<v Speaker 1>through every possible means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're best known for litigation,</v>

37
00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:13.334
<v Speaker 1>but from the beginning we have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely active in legislative arenas </v>

38
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:20.000
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a public forum</v>

39
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.293
<v Speaker 2>to define</v>

40
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.453
<v Speaker 1>what is a civil liberty is quite similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what the United States Supreme Court </v>

41
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 1>does when it tries to interpret the word</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty,</v>

42
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:37.400
<v Speaker 1>which appears in a couple of crucial </v>
<v Speaker 1>passages in the constitution,</v>

43
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.890
<v Speaker 1>including in the bill of rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

44
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do have to stress one difference,</v>

45
00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:48.191
<v Speaker 1>which is the ACLU is not the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>Constitutional Law Union.</v>

46
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.350
<v Speaker 1>People will often ask me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:55.730
<v Speaker 1>why aren't you doing more to enforce the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second amendment or how we interpret the</v>

48
00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Second Amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right to bear arms.</v>

49
00:02:57.561 --> 00:02:58.430
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us the question is,</v>

51
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>should something be a fundamental human </v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 1>And if the constitution is a tool that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can use to enforce it,</v>

53
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:09.574
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if the constitution does not avail </v>

54
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>to those purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we will look for another tool.</v>

55
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:15.004
<v Speaker 1>And let me give you one concrete example</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'll come back to the more </v>

56
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>abstract question.</v>

57
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

58
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.153
<v Speaker 1>and this surprises many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no constitutional right to be </v>

59
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:26.194
<v Speaker 1>free from racial discrimination by any </v>
<v Speaker 1>entity or individual aside from the </v>

60
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:32.614
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The constitution only applies to </v>

61
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 1>governmental actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so therefore,</v>

62
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 1>until we had the 1964 civil rights act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>private employers,</v>

63
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>private restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>private corporations,</v>

64
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>landlords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you name it,</v>

65
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.723
<v Speaker 1>we're completely free to discriminate in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most blatant ways on any basis they </v>

66
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 1>chose including race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The constitution simply did not apply.</v>

67
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 1>The Aclu therefore lobbied very hard for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the civil rights law,</v>

68
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.753
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we believe that there is a </v>

69
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:06.244
<v Speaker 1>fundamental civil liberty to be free </v>
<v Speaker 1>from racial and other forms of </v>

70
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:10.924
<v Speaker 1>demographic discrimination when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with major aggregations of </v>

71
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.970
<v Speaker 1>private power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:18.720
<v Speaker 1>in the employment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.580
<v Speaker 1>in the workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in housing and so forth.</v>

74
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.793
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

75
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.711
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:28.711
<v Speaker 1>civil libertarians will debate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree among ourselves over particular</v>

77
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:30.040
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

78
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly true that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

79
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 1>abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the best of my knowledge,</v>

80
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:39.391
<v Speaker 1>was not expressly on the ACL Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radar screen until sometime in the,</v>

81
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe 1960s.</v>

82
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:43.864
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.973
<v Speaker 1>I do know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the acl Ou was the first national </v>

84
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:49.324
<v Speaker 1>organization to call for a woman's right</v>
<v Speaker 1>to choose an abortion to be protected </v>

85
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:56.224
<v Speaker 1>under the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an organic outgrowth of </v>

86
00:04:58.991 --> 00:04:59.824
<v Speaker 1>work that we had from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of our earliest clients back in the </v>

87
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:03.994
<v Speaker 1>1920s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our first decade of existence was </v>

88
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Margaret Sanger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also represented Emma Goldman,</v>

89
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:09.754
<v Speaker 1>and these were two women who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>advocating what I think of is exactly </v>

90
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:13.511
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

91
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:18.511
<v Speaker 1>Which is a woman's right to information </v>
<v Speaker 1>and decisional autonomy,</v>

92
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>about her reproductive options and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.873
<v Speaker 1>medical information and assistance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>carry out an informed choice in those </v>

95
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:30.244
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>
