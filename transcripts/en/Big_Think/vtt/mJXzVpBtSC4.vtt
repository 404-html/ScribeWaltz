1
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.470
<v Speaker 1>One of the great things that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I love about what I do is we get to</v>

2
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.070
<v Speaker 1>take on some of the biggest challenges</v>
<v Speaker 1>in global health and global development.</v>

3
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.730
<v Speaker 1>And one of those challenges is water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sanitation and hygiene.</v>

4
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody needs clean water and you</v>

5
00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.660
<v Speaker 1>to quote the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody poops.</v>

7
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.160
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.630
<v Speaker 1>dealing with this in a clean and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sanitary way is really important for</v>

9
00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:31.870
<v Speaker 1>quality of life and it's also really</v>
<v Speaker 1>important for health and getting rid of</v>

10
00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:36.310
<v Speaker 1>certain diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the biggest challenges over the</v>

11
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.610
<v Speaker 1>last couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.480
<v Speaker 1>a really fun technological challenges</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been the reinvent the toilet</v>

13
00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:41.990
<v Speaker 1>project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.840
<v Speaker 1>the basic theme of this was looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there new solutions,</v>

15
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>21st century solutions to sanitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>echoing what we saw in a telephone and</v>

16
00:00:53.831 --> 00:00:57.190
<v Speaker 1>communication systems where a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries completely skipped over</v>

17
00:00:57.191 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>building a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big network of landlines and</v>

18
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:02.650
<v Speaker 1>traditional phones and went straight to</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phones.</v>

19
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question was,</v>

20
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:09.691
<v Speaker 1>could we come up with the equivalent</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology that would jump over building</v>

21
00:01:10.631 --> 00:01:14.170
<v Speaker 1>out sewer networks in giant water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive water treatment plants,</v>

22
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.320
<v Speaker 1>and jump immediately to non-network</v>
<v Speaker 1>sanitation.</v>

23
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.300
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that new approaches are</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible using mechanical engineering</v>

24
00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:24.820
<v Speaker 1>and chemical engineering approaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

25
00:01:24.821 --> 00:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>there's actually a lot of free energy in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the waste that can be used to process</v>

26
00:01:29.651 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 1>itself if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.930
<v Speaker 1>the machine to do it is designed</v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly and you can actually do this</v>

28
00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:38.650
<v Speaker 1>in a fairly cost effective way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reinvent the toilet challenge was</v>

29
00:01:38.651 --> 00:01:39.730
<v Speaker 1>kicked off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:41.410
<v Speaker 1>about five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.340
<v Speaker 1>in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>get universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.980
<v Speaker 1>different companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>design firms and so on to actually think</v>

34
00:01:47.981 --> 00:01:52.981
<v Speaker 1>about this and put a 21st century</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation applied to the problem of a</v>

35
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.060
<v Speaker 1>human sanitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's been remarkably,</v>

36
00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.190
<v Speaker 1>cool and successful so far to see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>different approaches that have come up.</v>

38
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.310
<v Speaker 1>There was one team of a lot of hurts</v>
<v Speaker 1>fellows that,</v>

39
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>

40
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on figuring out new ways to do</v>

41
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.820
<v Speaker 1>use pyrolysis and other approaches for</v>
<v Speaker 1>using electrolysis for drying.</v>

42
00:02:16.631 --> 00:02:20.260
<v Speaker 1>And combusting one group is running a</v>
<v Speaker 1>steam engine off of,</v>

43
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human waste as the input stream and</v>

44
00:02:22.781 --> 00:02:26.090
<v Speaker 1>we're a community would use to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.530
<v Speaker 1>10 tons of waste the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now all of a sudden a,</v>

46
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.770
<v Speaker 1>it runs a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a steam engine that generates 150</v>

47
00:02:32.771 --> 00:02:37.510
<v Speaker 1>kilowatts of electricity and puts out</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000 to 20,000 liters a day of potable</v>

48
00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:40.870
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is just really exciting to see</v>

49
00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:43.690
<v Speaker 1>what innovation can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what new technologies can do,</v>

50
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.050
<v Speaker 1>and actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.150
<v Speaker 1>taking on some of these really big</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges in saying what would be a</v>

52
00:02:49.151 --> 00:02:54.151
<v Speaker 1>really definitive technological solution</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this that actually solves the problem</v>

53
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:57.880
<v Speaker 1>in a way that we would never have</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagined trying 25 or 30 years ago.</v>
