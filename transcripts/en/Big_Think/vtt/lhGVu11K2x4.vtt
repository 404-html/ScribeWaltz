1
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most people that don't live on the</v>

2
00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:13.910
<v Speaker 1>south side of Chicago or in Illinois,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really.</v>

3
00:00:13.911 --> 00:00:18.860
<v Speaker 1>The first time that I ever heard of him</v>
<v Speaker 1>was when he was running for Senate and</v>

4
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.890
<v Speaker 1>we were looking at the New Yorker for</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting Senate,</v>

5
00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Congressional and State House races to</v>
<v Speaker 1>write about in addition to the</v>

6
00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:27.830
<v Speaker 1>presidential race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and somebody mentioned this guy,</v>

7
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:32.831
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was interesting and he was quite</v>

8
00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:37.991
<v Speaker 1>possibly going to win and it was a state</v>
<v Speaker 1>world kinds of bizarre things were</v>

9
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:43.301
<v Speaker 1>happening in that Senate race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the first real great event was</v>

10
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>his big democratic opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blair hall disappeared from the race</v>

11
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:53.441
<v Speaker 1>because his divorce records were opened</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and that wasn't an edifying spectacle</v>

12
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:57.410
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course there's this big</v>

13
00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:01.010
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Obama comes on the scene in 2004,</v>

14
00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 1>unless you're a real Illinois political</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuts and you know,</v>

15
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>he gave that speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the Boston convention in the</v>

16
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 1>summer of 2004 and he was pretty damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

17
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.920
<v Speaker 1>He was even better on television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had really learned that,</v>

18
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>that fine art of giving a speech to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big crowd and yet not over projecting so</v>

19
00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:24.350
<v Speaker 1>that it would come off as shouting on</v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

20
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:27.020
<v Speaker 1>So he was really developing these</v>
<v Speaker 1>talents.</v>

21
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2004,</v>

22
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.580
<v Speaker 1>but I gotta tell Ya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way in the world I thought he</v>

23
00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:33.680
<v Speaker 1>would be a presidential candidate in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2008,</v>

24
00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:34.970
<v Speaker 1>much less a successful one.</v>

25
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wanted to put out an issue of the New</v>

26
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Yorker just after the election was</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty clear that Obama was going to win</v>

27
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.920
<v Speaker 1>and they were going to be four or five</v>
<v Speaker 1>big pieces.</v>

28
00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:47.570
<v Speaker 1>David Grann,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Lizza,</v>

29
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were among the riders in that issue.</v>

30
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.700
<v Speaker 1>I want it to write about race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd written a fair amount about race</v>

31
00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:59.390
<v Speaker 1>in my time as a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Ryan was interested in other things.</v>

32
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:04.391
<v Speaker 1>Grand was going to write about Mccain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd written a biography of Muhammad</v>

33
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Ali.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew my way around,</v>

34
00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:08.980
<v Speaker 1>a little bit on the south side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago because that was part of the Ali</v>

35
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.910
<v Speaker 1>geography and politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I sort of took that on and I was</v>

36
00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:18.911
<v Speaker 1>intrigued by the speech that Obama gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>in March 2007 just after he announced</v>

37
00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:24.911
<v Speaker 1>for the presidency at in Selma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alabama at the commemoration of the</v>

38
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:25.700
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.730
<v Speaker 1>bloody Sunday events in the march from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Selma to Montgomery.</v>

40
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.000
<v Speaker 1>And he declared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

41
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.910
<v Speaker 1>he gave his great thanks to what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the Moses Generation,</v>

42
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:37.370
<v Speaker 1>the Moses generation being the civil</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights generation,</v>

43
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.530
<v Speaker 1>the generation that gave so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to people that were coming</v>

44
00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:47.240
<v Speaker 1>down the line that succeeded on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil rights act,</v>

45
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:51.560
<v Speaker 1>on voting rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on breaking open access to institutions</v>

46
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.670
<v Speaker 1>like institutions of higher learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Obama benefited from after all,</v>

47
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:57.560
<v Speaker 1>he went to nothing but elite</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>

48
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Pentaho's school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Occidental,</v>

49
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard law school.</v>

50
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>This would not have been possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>without the Moses generation.</v>

51
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>And even that went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which went for it.</v>

52
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>And then he declares himself the head of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Joshua Generation,</v>

53
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>his generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in their thirties,</v>

54
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties,</v>

55
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.850
<v Speaker 1>who benefited from these elders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he does this incredibly a ballsy</v>

56
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

57
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm the leader of the Joshua Generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes right after the African</v>

58
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>American vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you remember Hillary Clinton,</v>

59
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 1>the Clintons thought that they had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good purchase on the African</v>

60
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.570
<v Speaker 1>American vote because of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

61
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 1>long associations and Obama was</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging that.</v>

62
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

63
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>in order to get the Democratic</v>
<v Speaker 1>nomination for the presidency,</v>

64
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.990
<v Speaker 1>the African American vote is a very big</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>

65
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>You have to pursue that vote and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue it hard,</v>

66
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>not Iowa of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there aren't very many,</v>

67
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 1>but elsewhere down the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama could not assume that vote was</v>

68
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 1>his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember who knew who Barack Obama was</v>

69
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few people,</v>

70
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>really insiders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who had watched one speech from</v>

71
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>some time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to really pursue it.</v>

72
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>The Clintons didn't assume that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would win it,</v>

73
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 1>but they had a real historical purchase</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

74
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 1>They had associations with certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>with lots and lots of black leaders from</v>

75
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 1>around the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

76
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>he had been president for eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had done a lot of time in black</v>

77
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>churches and black groups and there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real relationship there.</v>

78
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:33.790
<v Speaker 1>There were a lot of loyalties and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of members of the civil rights</v>

79
00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 1>and people of that generation in media</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in show business and in business,</v>

81
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>people who are going to be donating</v>
<v Speaker 1>money had long associations with the</v>

82
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.843
<v Speaker 1>Clintons.</v>

83
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody like Vernon Jordan,</v>

84
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>people who ran bet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obama couldn't just jump in and by</v>

85
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>dint of is being African American</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumed he was going to get that vote.</v>

86
00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>He had to go out and win it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes to Iowa,</v>

87
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.730
<v Speaker 1>which is a white state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he won the Iowa caucuses running on</v>

88
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 1>the kind of appeal that you had seen in</v>
<v Speaker 1>previous years.</v>

89
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Like Gary Hart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

90
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 1>he was appealing to kind of well</v>
<v Speaker 1>educated,</v>

91
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 1>liberal leaning whites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>party regulars,</v>

92
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:19.680
<v Speaker 1>and they came out in droves from him</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the level of associate of</v>

93
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 1>organization in the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wins the Iowa primary and that starts</v>

94
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:28.180
<v Speaker 1>to give people around the country ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly he's on a much more equal</v>

95
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>footing with Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so black folks in places like South</v>

96
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a crucial primary state,</v>

97
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.393
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

98
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

99
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a chain reaction occurs now</v>

100
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.950
<v Speaker 1>that's not to say that black people</v>
<v Speaker 1>voted for Barack Obama and South</v>

101
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Carolina because they had some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>permission from white people,</v>

102
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 1>but black folks didn't want to be voting</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a symbolic candidate that had</v>

103
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:55.510
<v Speaker 1>happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd been many symbolic candidates.</v>

104
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:57.920
<v Speaker 1>And there are even been Jesse Jackson in</v>
<v Speaker 1>84 and 88.</v>

105
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>There is no Barack Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

106
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>without Jesse Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesse Jackson role is false.</v>

107
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:09.041
<v Speaker 1>Did an enormous historical good by</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking down the barriers toward the</v>

108
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.610
<v Speaker 1>political imagination of having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful African American presidential</v>

109
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:16.754
<v Speaker 1>candidate.</v>

110
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

111
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.980
<v Speaker 1>it's worthwhile to kind of fact check</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strangeness of Barack Obama's</v>

112
00:06:28.411 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Beginnings in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

113
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.390
<v Speaker 1>in racial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic,</v>

114
00:06:30.391 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 1>and identity terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He grows up with the exception of a</v>

115
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.360
<v Speaker 1>sojourn in Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Hawaii.</v>

116
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.400
<v Speaker 1>And if you've ever been to Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

117
00:06:38.401 --> 00:06:39.570
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this feeling of great,</v>

118
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.300
<v Speaker 1>almost isolation in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacific Ocean.</v>

119
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.110
<v Speaker 1>And it's a place that prides itself on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

120
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.860
<v Speaker 1>on variation on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a multiculturalism.</v>

121
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.580
<v Speaker 1>People using that word long before it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was fashionable on the,</v>

122
00:06:53.581 --> 00:06:54.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the mainland.</v>

123
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.680
<v Speaker 1>And yet it's a multiculturalism lacking</v>
<v Speaker 1>one very striking thing in American</v>

124
00:06:58.681 --> 00:07:02.370
<v Speaker 1>terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black folks and most of the black</v>

125
00:07:02.371 --> 00:07:05.390
<v Speaker 1>population in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little that there is,</v>

126
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.720
<v Speaker 1>is on military basis and Obama goes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the fanciest schools in the</v>

127
00:07:11.371 --> 00:07:13.500
<v Speaker 1>country of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this private school called [inaudible]</v>

128
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Ho in Honolulu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which looks like Exeter or andover,</v>

129
00:07:17.581 --> 00:07:19.440
<v Speaker 1>if you imagined it right near the beach.</v>

130
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Lockers outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people walking around in this shoe.</v>

131
00:07:22.411 --> 00:07:24.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just fantastically.</v>

132
00:07:24.121 --> 00:07:27.360
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it looks like a highschool</v>
<v Speaker 1>created by,</v>

133
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Netflix of cello or something,</v>

134
00:07:29.371 --> 00:07:31.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a beach fantasy of what high school</v>

135
00:07:31.621 --> 00:07:34.710
<v Speaker 1>could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes there and it's diverse in</v>

136
00:07:34.711 --> 00:07:37.380
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of Asian kids of all kinds.</v>

137
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the various stripes that you see in</v>

138
00:07:40.981 --> 00:07:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just a couple of black kids.</v>

139
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.160
<v Speaker 1>And when he goes home at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's two white grandparents.</v>

140
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.000
<v Speaker 1>So how does he learn how to be what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>sees in the mirror.</v>

141
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.720
<v Speaker 1>He pursues it by watching things on</v>
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>

142
00:07:54.721 --> 00:07:57.330
<v Speaker 1>listening to certain records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading certain books.</v>

143
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.810
<v Speaker 1>He goes out and assertively goes after</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and he does it then geographically by</v>

144
00:08:02.971 --> 00:08:06.120
<v Speaker 1>going to Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's kind of in Pasadena and that's</v>

145
00:08:06.121 --> 00:08:08.190
<v Speaker 1>not good enough for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes to Columbia,</v>

146
00:08:08.191 --> 00:08:11.820
<v Speaker 1>which is of course close to Harlem and</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally ones up on the south side of</v>

147
00:08:11.821 --> 00:08:16.821
<v Speaker 1>Chicago and there he's finally able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find community community,</v>

148
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.620
<v Speaker 1>a sense of purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sense of idealism,</v>

149
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:24.770
<v Speaker 1>a church black church specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he really begins to solve these</v>

150
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.470
<v Speaker 1>identity questions there.</v>

151
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.360
<v Speaker 1>By the time he gets to Harvard law</v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

152
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.710
<v Speaker 1>these things are resolved for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you go into public life,</v>

153
00:08:34.711 --> 00:08:37.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a question of how people see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's got to struggle with these</v>

154
00:08:37.891 --> 00:08:40.980
<v Speaker 1>questions all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he does things like run for</v>

155
00:08:40.981 --> 00:08:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Congress or for state senate.</v>
