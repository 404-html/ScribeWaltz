00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.630
<v Speaker 1>The ethical dilemma I've always</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggled with in my career as a writer</v>

2
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.523
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I tend to like the people that I write</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and I,</v>

4
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.830
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's my duty and job as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>writer to empathize with my subject.</v>

5
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to get too high flow Dostoyevsky's</v>

6
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.360
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy to condemn the evildoer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.520
<v Speaker 1>but the challenge is to understand him</v>
<v Speaker 1>or her.</v>

9
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm always trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.400
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

11
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.210
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes end up favoring my subjects</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>

12
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I have to be stern with myself</v>

13
00:00:49.151 --> 00:00:54.100
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethically it's my job to dig out the</v>

14
00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:56.770
<v Speaker 1>nasty truths and to tell them as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

15
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I tried to do.</v>

16
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I almost invariably fall out of favor</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the people I write about.</v>

17
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first book on Saudi Arabia was</v>

18
00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 1>banned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.650
<v Speaker 1>I am told this new book I've just</v>
<v Speaker 1>written on Saudi Arabia will be banned.</v>

20
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my most successful books,</v>

21
00:01:20.501 --> 00:01:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I went to live in Detroit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michigan and wrote about the Ford</v>

22
00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:26.020
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a wonderful experience to</v>

23
00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:29.680
<v Speaker 1>sort of live in a big old grimey</v>
<v Speaker 1>American city.</v>

24
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Although I could send them mentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>afford to say that because I was going</v>

25
00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:36.280
<v Speaker 1>to go away and I didn't have to live</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the problems of the rust belt.</v>

26
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I painted a wonderfully</v>

27
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic portrait of the Ford family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they haven't spoken to me from that</v>

28
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.040
<v Speaker 1>day to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.800
<v Speaker 1>and I can live with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

30
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the,</v>

31
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.410
<v Speaker 1>the job of being a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.410
<v Speaker 1>there's a falseness to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

33
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.260
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

34
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.920
<v Speaker 1>you meet someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you creator,</v>

35
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you genuinely like them,</v>

36
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.820
<v Speaker 1>but there's an element of facsimile in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the friendship that you are creating</v>

37
00:02:03.821 --> 00:02:06.310
<v Speaker 1>because it's going to end the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

38
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.610
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interview is over and you have to</v>

39
00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:10.444
<v Speaker 1>under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.640
<v Speaker 1>realistically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

41
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.410
<v Speaker 1>I interview people to get something out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them and they give me interviews</v>

42
00:02:17.411 --> 00:02:19.600
<v Speaker 1>because they want something out of me</v>
<v Speaker 1>weed.</v>

43
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.530
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.350
<v Speaker 1>does that bargain and compromise in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in every transaction that a writer or</v>

45
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.410
<v Speaker 1>journalist charism.</v>
