<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.320
<v Speaker 2>There's so many artists out there all</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know this sounds idealistic really</v>

<v Speaker 2>because they're artists and they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to make things and they come</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've never really met that many people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that make our just to make money.</v>

9
00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:44.320
<v Speaker 2>There's so many other ways to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

<v Speaker 2>can from investing in art that there's</v>

13
00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:58.750
<v Speaker 2>certain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain mythology about that.</v>

14
00:00:58.751 --> 00:00:59.531
<v Speaker 2>Even though,</v>
