00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.213
<v Speaker 1>I'm Rick Perlstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the author of Nixon's land problem </v>

2
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>with Obama's postcards and agenda is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he came into it,</v>

3
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:19.350
<v Speaker 1>he came into his presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.393
<v Speaker 1>at a time when millions of Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even tens of millions of </v>

5
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Americans don't consider a Democrat </v>
<v Speaker 1>president legitimate,</v>

6
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.913
<v Speaker 1>don't get sued or liberalism legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't consider the idea of the state </v>

7
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>farm new programs to help people </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate.</v>

8
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's in a situation a lot like,</v>

9
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>April Abraham Lincoln face in 18,</v>

10
00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:41.454
<v Speaker 1>60 when you had millions of Americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>who didn't even consider what was going </v>

11
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:47.190
<v Speaker 1>on in Washington to have anything to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

12
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.610
<v Speaker 1>So the big question for me was always </v>
<v Speaker 1>was this post partisan idea,</v>

13
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:53.604
<v Speaker 1>this idea that you could kind of bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>adversaries across the table and get </v>

14
00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:57.654
<v Speaker 1>them to agree to each other and agree </v>
<v Speaker 1>with to get them to agree with each </v>

15
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:00.700
<v Speaker 1>other and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>achieve social progress.</v>

17
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Was that a deep seated belief of his or </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that in a certain sense,</v>

18
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.480
<v Speaker 1>a tactic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a cynical tactic,</v>

19
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:10.314
<v Speaker 1>but a tactic and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be very with him if it were a </v>

20
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>way of thinking about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the war,</v>

21
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.143
<v Speaker 1>a tactic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the job of a transformative </v>

22
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:22.464
<v Speaker 1>leader is not too huge the center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to define their own values as the </v>

23
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>center as common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

24
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>if he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:33.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the agenda he's passed,</v>

26
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's putting far,</v>

27
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:36.400
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>universal healthcare,</v>

28
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.763
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cap and trade and green jobs as a way </v>

29
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>to solve our energy problems while </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing the economy.</v>

30
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.520
<v Speaker 1>I think these are reasonable a while </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal goals and uh,</v>

31
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.433
<v Speaker 1>if he presents them as reasonable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reaction to them as one could knew </v>

32
00:01:57.541 --> 00:01:58.374
<v Speaker 1>they were going to be because there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>these millions of people that don't </v>

33
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>consider a liberal president.</v>

34
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Legitimate was irrational extreme that </v>
<v Speaker 1>presented him an opportunity to say,</v>

35
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.013
<v Speaker 1>my program is rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my opposition has chosen extremism </v>

36
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.633
<v Speaker 1>has chosen on reason and be willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the hit that there's always going </v>

37
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 1>to be a minority of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty percent,</v>

38
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.273
<v Speaker 1>35 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even 40 percent who disagrees with him </v>

39
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:33.774
<v Speaker 1>radically disagrees with him strongly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if he's still willing to pass his </v>

40
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:39.684
<v Speaker 1>program with that 60 percent margin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the country will eventually </v>

41
00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:44.574
<v Speaker 1>catch up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reaction notice will understand as </v>

42
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>they did with social security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they did with women getting the vote,</v>

43
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 1>freeing the slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>social security that actually these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things were in their interests.</v>

45
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 1>They'll accept them as part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>established order of American society.</v>

46
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

47
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years years down the road,</v>

48
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.183
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans and the Conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be campaigning to save universal </v>

49
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.263
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a campaign to save social </v>

50
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:14.074
<v Speaker 1>security.</v>

51
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.913
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is this doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>work unless you make this kind of </v>

52
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:18.724
<v Speaker 1>tactical shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people say that you're illegitimate </v>

53
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>and your liberal agenda is extremist </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist,</v>

54
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.623
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroying the America that we all grew </v>

55
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:29.584
<v Speaker 1>up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be willing to say this is </v>

56
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is extreme.</v>

57
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>And if you aren't able to say this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable and this is extreme,</v>

58
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.720
<v Speaker 1>then you're granting your opposition a </v>
<v Speaker 1>undue influence.</v>

59
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>You're basically negotiating with the UN</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiator bubble.</v>

60
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:53.130
<v Speaker 1>as Abraham Lincoln said quite eloquently</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his 18,</v>

62
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>60 speech at Cooper Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>you can't win that way.</v>

64
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.090
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying for years that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>there are millions of Americans who </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically don't consider,</v>

66
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the liberal project legitimate.</v>

67
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>They consider it the opposite of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>America means to them and,</v>

68
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.883
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they derive their identity from </v>

69
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:22.561
<v Speaker 1>questioning the legitimacy and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability of liberal government to,</v>

70
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 1>to function peacefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

71
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that for a couple months,</v>

72
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even more maybe six months,</v>

73
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama's charisma and his,</v>

74
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:37.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his remarkable popularity,</v>

75
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.053
<v Speaker 1>a kind of stunned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these people into silence think </v>

76
00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:44.050
<v Speaker 1>people couldn't quite believe what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying.</v>

77
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.610
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

78
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.290
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at it historically,</v>

79
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:52.291
<v Speaker 1>it's quite continuous with what happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Bill Clinton became president.</v>

80
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.613
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you began to hear people accusing </v>

81
00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 1>him of murdering his aids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

82
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.440
<v Speaker 1>when you began to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 1>saying that he was actually a agent for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union,</v>

85
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 1>which he had visited when he was a child</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when he was a teenager when he was in</v>

86
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:09.754
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>

87
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 1>And you saw the same thing when Jimmy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carter became president and,</v>

88
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.763
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was immediately considered a part of </v>

90
00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:20.434
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

91
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.140
<v Speaker 1>corrupt Democratic Party establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

92
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.450
<v Speaker 1>it happened every time a Democrat was </v>
<v Speaker 1>elected and it will happen.</v>

93
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Every time a Democrat is elected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of our patrimony as Americans.</v>

94
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.353
<v Speaker 1>And the challenge for a Barack Obama or </v>
<v Speaker 1>any democrat or any liberal is to </v>

95
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 1>understand that this is just part of who</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are as Americans to acknowledge it,</v>

96
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>to respect it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to transcend it.</v>

97
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.970
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

98
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lion can lay down with the lamb,</v>

99
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to last for very </v>
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

100
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tactically the,</v>

101
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 1>the threat of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by conservatives,</v>

102
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:03.314
<v Speaker 1>by social conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the conservative movement as they </v>

103
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 1>call themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based in Washington,</v>

104
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:08.190
<v Speaker 1>based in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>places like northern Virginia,</v>

106
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to form a new party has always been this</v>

107
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 1>kind of bluff designed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

108
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bend the Republican Party to their will.</v>

109
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.590
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

111
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>it's usually worked because the media </v>
<v Speaker 1>reports it seriously except for,</v>

112
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 1>in the American context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:31.070
<v Speaker 1>third parties very rarely work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a winner take all system,</v>

114
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.500
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the minute,</v>

115
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.850
<v Speaker 1>say wichard Viguerie who threatens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create a third party,</v>

116
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:35.684
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every four or eight years because he </v>

117
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 1>claims that the conservatives in power </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't really conservative.</v>

118
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 1>If he really did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would immediately be surrendering all</v>

119
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:47.840
<v Speaker 1>his influence in national discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not really a serious threat.</v>

120
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the division between,</v>

121
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 1>let's say a corporate conservatives and </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious conservatives is fascinating,</v>

122
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.990
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich and complex.</v>

123
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.213
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways it worked was that </v>

124
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.570
<v Speaker 1>traditionally not traditionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

125
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:06.404
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways that evolved in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies was that people who wanted a </v>

126
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.160
<v Speaker 1>business who wanted a more laissez </v>
<v Speaker 1>faire,</v>

127
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.120
<v Speaker 1>less regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more control over government,</v>

128
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 1>more of say a cronyism stake and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>government was actually doing,</v>

129
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw things like the Heritage Foundation,</v>

130
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.233
<v Speaker 1>the Christian coalition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moral majority as opportunities for </v>

131
00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:31.440
<v Speaker 1>them to form a coalition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

132
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.490
<v Speaker 1>if you give it a generous interpretation</v>
<v Speaker 1>or aggrandized their power,</v>

133
00:07:34.491 --> 00:07:36.800
<v Speaker 1>if you give it a little more cynical </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>

134
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.400
<v Speaker 1>So you get these fascinating moments </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

135
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.460
<v Speaker 1>A war in West Virginia in 1974 by </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious conservatives to,</v>

136
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.013
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kick a heathen textbooks out of the </v>

137
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:54.590
<v Speaker 1>schools that were sort of supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>imposed by religious bureaucrats.</v>

138
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.170
<v Speaker 1>It was a very local issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very localized,</v>

139
00:07:57.171 --> 00:07:59.240
<v Speaker 1>struggled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had a lot to do with the way politics</v>

140
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:00.074
<v Speaker 1>works in West Virginia where you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of history of insurgent </v>

141
00:08:02.811 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 1>violence from coal miners.</v>

142
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:05.803
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get these conservative business </v>

143
00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:10.244
<v Speaker 1>conservatives in Washington at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Heritage Foundation realizing that this </v>

144
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:15.043
<v Speaker 1>is an organizing opportunity for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Heritage Foundation sends </v>

145
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:22.331
<v Speaker 1>representatives down to West Virginia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and helps put these people in touch with</v>

146
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:23.803
<v Speaker 1>national ideological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large entrepreneurs with people like </v>

147
00:08:26.181 --> 00:08:27.014
<v Speaker 1>Richard Viguerie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how a coalition forms that </v>

148
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:30.734
<v Speaker 1>basically creates foot soldiers for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>agenda that the West Virginia religious </v>

149
00:08:35.721 --> 00:08:38.540
<v Speaker 1>conservatives may or may not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting,</v>

150
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.180
<v Speaker 1>but eventually they'll come to support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

151
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.390
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

152
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.010
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

153
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.670
<v Speaker 1>there's both an inherent tension and </v>
<v Speaker 1>instability in it,</v>

154
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.340
<v Speaker 1>but there's also within American </v>
<v Speaker 1>protestantism,</v>

155
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 1>a real strain of pro capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

156
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

157
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:56.940
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

158
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.160
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's rich,</v>

159
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 1>it's tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it works,</v>

160
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

161
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.830
<v Speaker 1>and right now we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.500
<v Speaker 1>at a real knife's edge about whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to work or whether it's going</v>

163
00:09:06.501 --> 00:09:07.334
<v Speaker 1>to fall apart.</v>

164
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.053
<v Speaker 1>The CEO of a say in Aerospace </v>
<v Speaker 1>Corporation might not want to have </v>

165
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:18.630
<v Speaker 1>anything to do with a demonic </v>
<v Speaker 1>possession,</v>

166
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

167
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:21.970
<v Speaker 1>in pentecostal churches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

168
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he needs the people who have those great</v>

169
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 1>passions in order to kind of anchor the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative coalition.</v>

170
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:29.843
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when have they created a Frankenstein's </v>

171
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.140
<v Speaker 1>monster whenever they created something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

172
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't control.</v>

173
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.700
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing more and more indications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a buy from conservatives have,</v>

174
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of embarrassment.</v>

175
00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.140
<v Speaker 1>And I was out the other night and a West</v>
<v Speaker 1>Point Grad,</v>

176
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:47.750
<v Speaker 1>a banker friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

177
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:48.873
<v Speaker 1>who's a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called himself the country club </v>

178
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:50.844
<v Speaker 1>conservative and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing to do with those Sarah </v>

179
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.460
<v Speaker 1>Pailin people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

180
00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:55.410
<v Speaker 1>the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without those Sarah Pailin people,</v>

181
00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:57.270
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans would never win an </v>
<v Speaker 1>election.</v>

182
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:58.050
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:02.070
<v Speaker 1>they find themselves on the horns of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dilemma.</v>

184
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.400
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

185
00:10:03.401 --> 00:10:08.401
<v Speaker 1>the ideological entrepreneurs on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious right who,</v>

186
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:09.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

187
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.093
<v Speaker 1>let's face it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an interest in a grandizing their </v>

188
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:15.340
<v Speaker 1>power and their control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

189
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.980
<v Speaker 1>don't really have any incentive to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

190
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.630
<v Speaker 1>to modify or moderate their positions.</v>

191
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.570
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more likely to aggrandized their</v>

192
00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:29.790
<v Speaker 1>power and their influence by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

193
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.940
<v Speaker 1>by maintaining a front of purity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know that,</v>

194
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:33.774
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that speaks to the whole tension and </v>

195
00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:38.850
<v Speaker 1>paradox behind the conservative project </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

196
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:39.684
<v Speaker 1>all the people who have ascended to </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions of power and leadership in </v>

197
00:10:42.811 --> 00:10:43.644
<v Speaker 1>rush lumbar is a perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he pretty much unites the </v>

198
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.750
<v Speaker 1>religious and a business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives pretty seamlessly,</v>

199
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have achieved their influence,</v>

200
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:56.423
<v Speaker 1>have achieved their power through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain kind of cultural style based on </v>

201
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.420
<v Speaker 1>their willingness to say that compromise</v>
<v Speaker 1>is inherently bad.</v>

202
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:07.973
<v Speaker 1>And that gets back to the question of </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether Obama can negotiate with the 20 </v>

203
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:11.783
<v Speaker 1>million people who listened to rush </v>
<v Speaker 1>limbaugh everyday and consider any </v>

204
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:14.814
<v Speaker 1>compromise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compromise a betrayal of America's </v>

205
00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:19.560
<v Speaker 1>promise itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

206
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:20.423
<v Speaker 1>So there's no incentive for a rush </v>
<v Speaker 1>limbaugh to change because this is </v>

207
00:11:23.221 --> 00:11:24.630
<v Speaker 1>what's given him this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:26.340
<v Speaker 1>these 20 million listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

209
00:11:26.341 --> 00:11:27.870
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his mansion that has a,</v>

210
00:11:27.871 --> 00:11:28.704
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a replica of the hall of mirrors at </v>

211
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Versailles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

212
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

213
00:11:33.181 --> 00:11:34.014
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republican National Committee or a </v>

214
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.403
<v Speaker 1>train of a conservative Republicans who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wish to moderate the image of their </v>

215
00:11:42.421 --> 00:11:45.780
<v Speaker 1>party to make it seem more centrist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>palatable to swing voters,</v>

216
00:11:45.781 --> 00:11:46.614
<v Speaker 1>try and do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rush limbaugh is able to not merely </v>

217
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.670
<v Speaker 1>survive but thrive by disdaining them.</v>

218
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.863
<v Speaker 1>Healthcare is a fascinating example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this question of how religious </v>

219
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:08.560
<v Speaker 1>conservatives and business conservatives</v>
<v Speaker 1>can act in coalition.</v>

220
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being on the,</v>

221
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.491
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

222
00:12:11.491 --> 00:12:12.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mailing list of,</v>

223
00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:13.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

224
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.030
<v Speaker 1>the American Family Association,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don Wildman Organization.</v>

225
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:21.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm beginning to get the emails saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that know healthcare.</v>

226
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

227
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:23.590
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.460
<v Speaker 1>basically national national healthcare </v>
<v Speaker 1>program is imposition on Christians.</v>

229
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to do a fund abortions.</v>

230
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:31.023
<v Speaker 1>It's going to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violate the sanctity of the traditional </v>

231
00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:35.344
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see a pure example of kind of a </v>

232
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:41.080
<v Speaker 1>right wing libertarian business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives,</v>

233
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using,</v>

234
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.473
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leaders of the religious right in a </v>

235
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 1>quite an effective way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

236
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:49.503
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.290
<v Speaker 1>undermine a mass constituency for </v>
<v Speaker 1>reform,</v>

238
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.620
<v Speaker 1>which in the end is actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative.</v>

239
00:12:56.621 --> 00:12:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could be more,</v>

240
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:58.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

241
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.360
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could be more judicious then,</v>

242
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

243
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.870
<v Speaker 1>letting people change their jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

244
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.793
<v Speaker 1>if they have an entrepreneurial idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could be more strengthening of the </v>

245
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:13.210
<v Speaker 1>traditional bonds of family and society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then families not going bankrupt because</v>

246
00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:14.710
<v Speaker 1>someone in the family gets sick.</v>

247
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:16.391
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

248
00:13:16.391 --> 00:13:17.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

249
00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:19.940
<v Speaker 1>there are very powerful interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

250
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.860
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

251
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:22.103
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically benefit from the status quo </v>

252
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.350
<v Speaker 1>and they're able to take advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this preexisting,</v>

253
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.650
<v Speaker 1>a deep distrust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a that's,</v>

254
00:13:32.651 --> 00:13:33.484
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very American of anything having to do </v>

255
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.420
<v Speaker 1>with an expanding state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

256
00:13:37.421 --> 00:13:41.920
<v Speaker 1>historically it's the same thing you saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>was social security.</v>

257
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.040
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing you saw with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Medicare.</v>

258
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.143
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing you saw with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that the United States in the 19th </v>

259
00:13:49.481 --> 00:13:51.550
<v Speaker 1>century should have a central bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

260
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:55.720
<v Speaker 1>the same thing you saw when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government began talking about financing</v>

261
00:13:55.721 --> 00:13:58.540
<v Speaker 1>internal improvements like canals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

262
00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:00.040
<v Speaker 1>the interstates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:02.380
<v Speaker 1>which were seen as a communist plot by </v>
<v Speaker 1>some people.</v>

264
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

265
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the challenge for progressives,</v>

266
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.380
<v Speaker 1>the challenge for people who believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is,</v>

267
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only,</v>

268
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

269
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 1>an important goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an imperative goal.</v>

270
00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:18.843
<v Speaker 1>National healthcare is a not to imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this kind of irrational fear is </v>

271
00:14:25.061 --> 00:14:25.894
<v Speaker 1>going to go away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but simply to both through it forced </v>

272
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:30.910
<v Speaker 1>healthcare down people's throats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they,</v>

273
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.060
<v Speaker 1>whether they like it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and watch what happens 10,</v>

274
00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:34.751
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

275
00:14:34.751 --> 00:14:38.620
<v Speaker 1>40 years from now when again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives come to power,</v>

276
00:14:38.621 --> 00:14:40.780
<v Speaker 1>promising to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

277
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:45.280
<v Speaker 1>to uphold the ideals of a Obama's </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare program.</v>

278
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:46.383
<v Speaker 1>Just like George Bush promised to uphold</v>
<v Speaker 1>social security and promised to honor </v>

279
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Fdr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

280
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

281
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives have any gender,</v>

282
00:14:56.361 --> 00:14:58.600
<v Speaker 1>every generation or I should say </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactionaries advantage.</v>

283
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Every generation say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

284
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.550
<v Speaker 1>the liberals that we're dealing with now</v>
<v Speaker 1>are unacceptable extremists.</v>

285
00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:05.663
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones we had last generation weren't </v>

286
00:15:07.011 --> 00:15:07.844
<v Speaker 1>so bad.</v>

287
00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:11.603
<v Speaker 1>I don't see it over the horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Reagan is a perfect example of </v>

288
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 1>someone who simultaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

289
00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:22.451
<v Speaker 1>kind of honored the impulses of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>grassroots,</v>

290
00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:23.654
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also kind of massage them and also </v>

291
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.790
<v Speaker 1>treated them like a politician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treats a member of it's coalition,</v>

292
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.510
<v Speaker 1>like Franklin Roosevelt treated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unions are Lyndon Johnson,</v>

293
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treated,</v>

294
00:15:33.531 --> 00:15:34.364
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the civil rights movement and the </v>

295
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.493
<v Speaker 1>consumer rights movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronald Reagan was able to basically </v>

296
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:44.540
<v Speaker 1>massage the concerns of the pro life </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement without ever giving a speech to</v>

297
00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:49.541
<v Speaker 1>them without ever granting them any </v>
<v Speaker 1>major policy concessions while able to,</v>

298
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to,</v>

299
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:52.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

300
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.073
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their acolytes in positions of relative </v>

301
00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:57.860
<v Speaker 1>powerlessness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerlessness,</v>

302
00:15:57.861 --> 00:15:59.480
<v Speaker 1>symbolic positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

303
00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:03.380
<v Speaker 1>things like smaller ambassadorships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent government commissions.</v>

304
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.150
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

305
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.650
<v Speaker 1>with his criticism and skill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was able to,</v>

306
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.533
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mitigate the kinds of tensions that </v>

307
00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:13.550
<v Speaker 1>created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were tensions,</v>

308
00:16:13.551 --> 00:16:14.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early in the eighties,</v>

309
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.740
<v Speaker 1>George will was one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Viguerie was another.</v>

310
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.813
<v Speaker 1>There were a lot of conservatives saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Ronald Reagan is betraying </v>

311
00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:23.024
<v Speaker 1>conservatism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which tend to happens whenever a </v>

312
00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:28.760
<v Speaker 1>conservative president is politically </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsuccessful.</v>

313
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Conservatism never fails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is only failed.</v>

314
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.290
<v Speaker 1>They'll say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

315
00:16:33.291 --> 00:16:34.124
<v Speaker 1>Ronald Reagan or George Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It fails because they're not </v>

316
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:38.444
<v Speaker 1>conservative and that sentiment lasts </v>
<v Speaker 1>for as long as they're politically </v>

317
00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:45.050
<v Speaker 1>unsuccessful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But George Bush,</v>

318
00:16:45.051 --> 00:16:45.884
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

319
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.110
<v Speaker 1>every other day you hear a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

320
00:16:48.111 --> 00:16:48.944
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason he failed was he wasn't </v>

321
00:16:49.611 --> 00:16:51.580
<v Speaker 1>conservative enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

322
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:56.360
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that is a George W Bush</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought to Washington,</v>

323
00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alongside a,</v>

324
00:16:59.090 --> 00:16:59.923
<v Speaker 1>for most of his term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a majority conservative congress and </v>

325
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:04.940
<v Speaker 1>quite conservative judiciary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an entire movement,</v>

326
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.193
<v Speaker 1>entire set of institutions and entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy that conservatives have </v>

327
00:17:09.681 --> 00:17:10.780
<v Speaker 1>built up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

328
00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:15.790
<v Speaker 1>in the years since Barry Goldwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when George Bush is president,</v>

329
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:21.820
<v Speaker 1>he is not just a acting independently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's acting for the figurehead,</v>

330
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:22.980
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

331
00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.260
<v Speaker 1>an enormous movement that was able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>insinuates itself,</v>

332
00:17:26.261 --> 00:17:27.094
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and down in the bureaucracy and up </v>

333
00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:29.120
<v Speaker 1>and down the political chain.</v>

334
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.700
<v Speaker 1>So that's where the blame asked to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now with George Bush,</v>

335
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:36.883
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of people I come across once</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a generation and you can't pick them </v>

336
00:17:39.261 --> 00:17:43.670
<v Speaker 1>out of a catalog and they can kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to come from surprising places,</v>

337
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.833
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>

338
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

339
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:48.250
<v Speaker 1>62 when Ronald Reagan was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

340
00:17:48.251 --> 00:17:51.370
<v Speaker 1>it's washed up act going around from Ge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>planted Ge plant,</v>

341
00:17:51.371 --> 00:17:53.490
<v Speaker 1>given patriotic speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one saw that it was him.</v>

342
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see who it is,</v>

343
00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.160
<v Speaker 1>but if I saw how it was then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be a,</v>

344
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a genius political consultant or I'd be </v>

345
00:18:03.451 --> 00:18:04.284
<v Speaker 1>a great leader myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a leaders see things in the </v>

346
00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:11.910
<v Speaker 1>public will that are often invisible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of us mere mortals.</v>

347
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.150
<v Speaker 1>There will always be an American </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism.</v>

348
00:18:18.151 --> 00:18:20.140
<v Speaker 1>It's completely continuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

349
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.993
<v Speaker 1>throughout our history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has its own shifts and changes and </v>

350
00:18:23.161 --> 00:18:25.510
<v Speaker 1>evolutions in some positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

351
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.353
<v Speaker 1>that helped in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't hold now and some positions </v>

352
00:18:27.841 --> 00:18:29.080
<v Speaker 1>that holds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holds,</v>

353
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.080
<v Speaker 1>it holds now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't hold in the past.</v>

354
00:18:31.081 --> 00:18:31.914
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

355
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.943
<v Speaker 1>you know the concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a conservative in the 19 </v>

356
00:18:34.201 --> 00:18:35.034
<v Speaker 1>thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're known as someone who didn't </v>

357
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:38.790
<v Speaker 1>believe in foreign military </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervention,</v>

358
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:39.953
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were fighting against the idea that </v>

359
00:18:40.981 --> 00:18:43.650
<v Speaker 1>America should rearm for World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

360
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:44.730
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

361
00:18:44.731 --> 00:18:45.564
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are the people who are </v>

362
00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:47.200
<v Speaker 1>most likely to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

363
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.233
<v Speaker 1>call for a huge defense establishment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and be more eager to kind of go on </v>

364
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:52.703
<v Speaker 1>overseas adventures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something having to do with </v>

365
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:55.494
<v Speaker 1>individualism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having to do with sort of this </v>

366
00:18:57.181 --> 00:19:02.181
<v Speaker 1>fetishization of the nuclear family and </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional values having to do with the</v>

367
00:19:02.731 --> 00:19:07.530
<v Speaker 1>belief that a businessman's republic </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of run a bind for businessman who's</v>

368
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.393
<v Speaker 1>a benevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of trickles down to ordinary </v>

369
00:19:09.721 --> 00:19:10.554
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

370
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.830
<v Speaker 1>That's always been a part of American </v>
<v Speaker 1>political culture.</v>

371
00:19:13.831 --> 00:19:15.570
<v Speaker 1>And it always will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

372
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:17.880
<v Speaker 1>the challenge for progressives is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

373
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put together a coalition to make sure </v>

374
00:19:19.771 --> 00:19:20.604
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

375
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:22.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conservative coalition,</v>

376
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have enough power to,</v>

377
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.380
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say a push through their agenda.</v>

378
00:19:28.381 --> 00:19:30.480
<v Speaker 1>But it's often the case that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have an agenda.</v>

379
00:19:30.481 --> 00:19:31.314
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there really is no conservative theory </v>

380
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:32.754
<v Speaker 1>of government as we saw for especially </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first six years of the Bush </v>

381
00:19:36.601 --> 00:19:38.210
<v Speaker 1>administration in which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

382
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.480
<v Speaker 1>basically had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

383
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.333
<v Speaker 1>conservative hammerlock on the forces of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state and all they were able to </v>

384
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:49.940
<v Speaker 1>really do was a weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

385
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:50.963
<v Speaker 1>the state weaken our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectively solve our problems </v>

386
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.133
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

387
00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among conservatives saying,</v>

388
00:20:00.901 --> 00:20:03.870
<v Speaker 1>your libertarian is always been a way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

389
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.793
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in everything having to do </v>

390
00:20:07.591 --> 00:20:08.424
<v Speaker 1>with conservatism except the </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing stuff now except the stuff </v>

391
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.260
<v Speaker 1>except the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

392
00:20:13.261 --> 00:20:16.620
<v Speaker 1>the spiritual warfare casting out demons</v>
<v Speaker 1>from certain zip codes,</v>

393
00:20:16.621 --> 00:20:17.040
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

394
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.640
<v Speaker 1>a big part of Ted Haggard's paradigm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the church,</v>

395
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.260
<v Speaker 1>the Pentecostal Church that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

396
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Pailin is involved with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

397
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.160
<v Speaker 1>so it's always been a more of a gesture </v>
<v Speaker 1>than anything else.</v>

398
00:20:29.161 --> 00:20:29.994
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who call themselves </v>

399
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.493
<v Speaker 1>libertarians within the Republican party</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least had been quite willing to go </v>

400
00:20:34.831 --> 00:20:35.610
<v Speaker 1>along with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

401
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.680
<v Speaker 1>these kind of violations of civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberties.</v>

402
00:20:37.681 --> 00:20:39.690
<v Speaker 1>They have kind of gone along with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war on terrorism.</v>

403
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Although there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

404
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.430
<v Speaker 1>genuine libertarians on the right who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been actually quite heroic,</v>

405
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.553
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at preserving the principles of civil </v>

406
00:20:47.171 --> 00:20:48.600
<v Speaker 1>liberties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

407
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>

408
00:20:50.711 --> 00:20:51.544
<v Speaker 1>among Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among liberals who find themselves a </v>

409
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.530
<v Speaker 1>enraptured by the concepts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism.</v>

410
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as good a fit.</v>

411
00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:02.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

412
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.600
<v Speaker 1>some folks have been talking now about </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian,</v>

413
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:09.660
<v Speaker 1>liberal Terry aneurysm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the idea that liberalism can be</v>

414
00:21:10.571 --> 00:21:11.404
<v Speaker 1>stripped of its kind of paternalistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements and a respect the autonomy </v>

415
00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:16.930
<v Speaker 1>people better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

416
00:21:16.931 --> 00:21:17.764
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that is that's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>been the ideal of liberalism and </v>

417
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:22.324
<v Speaker 1>liberalism at it's best and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democratic Party and its most mature </v>

418
00:21:25.601 --> 00:21:27.880
<v Speaker 1>form has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

419
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.240
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

420
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:30.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempted to create the maximum amount </v>

421
00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.930
<v Speaker 1>of equality alongside the maximum amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of freedom.</v>

422
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:38.764
<v Speaker 1>Now it's something that's often an </v>
<v Speaker 1>honored only in the breach because </v>

423
00:21:41.831 --> 00:21:46.831
<v Speaker 1>that's the hardest thing for human </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies to be able to accomplish.</v>

424
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:48.030
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

425
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:48.863
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

426
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.570
<v Speaker 1>the liberal vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

427
00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.840
<v Speaker 1>dovetails with what's called in the rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world social democracy,</v>

428
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.830
<v Speaker 1>which is that you can't really enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

429
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:00.963
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like liberty unless you have some </v>

430
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.440
<v Speaker 1>minimum standard of living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

431
00:22:05.441 --> 00:22:08.260
<v Speaker 1>unless you're free to change jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

432
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.550
<v Speaker 1>if you hate your boss and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of losing your health insurance,</v>

433
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's neither paternalistic,</v>

434
00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:16.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

435
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.540
<v Speaker 1>nor is it a socialistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's entrepreneurial,</v>

436
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:20.471
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

437
00:22:20.471 --> 00:22:21.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

438
00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:21.461
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

439
00:22:21.461 --> 00:22:24.520
<v Speaker 1>straight down the center of liberalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

440
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.473
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something a libertarian would </v>

441
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.930
<v Speaker 1>reject because it involves expanding the</v>
<v Speaker 1>role for the state.</v>

442
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.153
<v Speaker 1>But a liberal at its best understands </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes expanding the state can </v>

443
00:22:36.701 --> 00:22:41.140
<v Speaker 1>actually enhance liberty in pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>profound ways.</v>
