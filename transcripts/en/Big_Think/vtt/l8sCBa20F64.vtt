1
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.600
<v Speaker 1>I never thought of myself as one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first wave of women,</v>

2
00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>much of my career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that I've sort of been</v>

3
00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>following and the women who went ahead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of me in blazing the trails that made it</v>

4
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>possible to do what I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this really is the first point in my</v>

5
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>life where I've gotten to be the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the reason it happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a lot to do with Kellogg is um,</v>

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>has a lot to do also with the state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>where business education has gotten to</v>

8
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women students come up to me and women</v>

9
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>from many different areas come up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

10
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>how did you get to be dean of Kellogg?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

11
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't follow my model was the wrong</v>

12
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.980
<v Speaker 1>button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

13
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:36.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

14
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>I was a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be I was a social psychologist rather</v>

15
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 1>than an economist.</v>

16
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>And See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just spent six years in undergraduate</v>

17
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>business education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And none of those have tended to be the</v>

18
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>power alleys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>

19
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>what I think it tells us the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kellogg was ready to apply in a woman</v>

20
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>and a top business school was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the world has changed a lot.</v>

21
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 1>There's a much deeper appreciation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology in business school</v>

22
00:00:57.151 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>environments in addition to economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

23
00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>that's something I knew was important</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I made the choice to study</v>

24
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>psychology years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>but I think the world has certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>embraced that view more so.</v>

26
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting thing that when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at graduate schools of business,</v>

27
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>about 30 percent to 35 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>students tend to be women.</v>

28
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>And this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

29
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all top business schools through</v>

30
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>every sort of sector of the business</v>
<v Speaker 1>school education domain.</v>

31
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you look at law schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical schools,</v>

32
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>they tend to be about 50 percent women</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the feeder undergraduate programs at</v>

33
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>colleges and research universities are</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

34
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>most of them are at least 50 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

35
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>if not more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This persistent fact that business</v>

36
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:42.390
<v Speaker 1>schools are lower is an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>question and people are just beginning</v>

37
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:47.391
<v Speaker 1>to get some data around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recently read a study done by the</v>

38
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Simmons College and School of business</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's finding there are negative</v>

39
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>attitudes towards business of women in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the high school and the junior high</v>

40
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>school years and they think that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>may be in part explaining why not as</v>

41
00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>many women are going to graduate schools</v>
<v Speaker 1>of business.</v>

42
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.670
<v Speaker 1>I still think it's a perplexing question</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

43
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>because businesses such a dominant</v>
<v Speaker 1>institution in our society and so many</v>

44
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 1>people are drawn to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the most popular undergraduate</v>

45
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>major in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while I see the negative business</v>

46
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.500
<v Speaker 1>attitudes piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I keep wondering is that the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer?</v>

48
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>It's important data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the cheapest degree.</v>

49
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 1>It's only two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>redmond,</v>

50
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.050
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five.</v>

51
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>So it truly is a perplexing question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of it I wonder is if we haven't</v>

52
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>misrepresented in some ways what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn at business school.</v>

53
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.320
<v Speaker 1>To me the greatest skill that you learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>is how to build effective organizations.</v>

54
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>You learn about the markets and how they</v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

55
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 1>but you learn how to build effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations,</v>

56
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>which is how we as human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>organize,</v>

57
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>which is how we get things done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think of we did a better job at</v>

58
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>explaining to people that that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about.</v>

59
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>I think that more women might be drawn</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it because women naturally organize</v>

60
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.170
<v Speaker 1>in their communities and our families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>in our churches and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all sorts of.</v>

62
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>And I can't help wondering if we need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get more enlightened language so people</v>

63
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>truly understand that business school</v>
<v Speaker 1>really is about building effective</v>

64
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 1>organizations within a market context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it can also be in a not for profit</v>

65
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>context or a religious context.</v>

66
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just a question of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite honestly,</v>

67
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the unique challenges to</v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

68
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 1>We've broken the glass ceilings now in</v>
<v Speaker 1>many places,</v>

69
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 1>not maybe it is high numbers as some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would have hoped,</v>

70
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:30.740
<v Speaker 1>but we've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

71
00:03:30.741 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that we broke the glass</v>
<v Speaker 1>ceiling of Harvard before we did have a</v>

72
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 1>major business school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

73
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've broken the glass ceilings that a</v>

74
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 1>lot of fortune 500 companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recently had the privilege of being</v>

75
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>asked to go to the fortune most powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>women summit.</v>

76
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>It was in Washington dc this past fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the room was just packed with these</v>

77
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>incredibly talented women and I looked</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and I found myself intimidated</v>

78
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>and I realize people are intimidated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I've done.</v>

79
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we're doing it.</v>

80
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a question of choices for women</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it does require trade offs.</v>

81
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to have it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have a perfect marriage,</v>

82
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>perfect kids the perfect job and be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect shape physically and I think</v>

83
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:15.571
<v Speaker 1>it's a question of tradeoffs and how far</v>
<v Speaker 1>women decided to go in the into business</v>

84
00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:16.800
<v Speaker 1>I think will impart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>determined,</v>

85
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>be determined by choices about child</v>
<v Speaker 1>rearing and the structure of the</v>

86
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 1>American family and how do we decide to</v>
<v Speaker 1>allocate our resources.</v>

87
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Economics is the study of markets and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll.</v>

88
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Sociology also involves the study of</v>
<v Speaker 1>markets.</v>

89
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Many disciplines take an eye on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important to remember that all the</v>

90
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:41.491
<v Speaker 1>market is is a group of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>transactions and all the transaction is</v>

91
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>as a buyer and seller getting together a</v>
<v Speaker 1>buyer saying,</v>

92
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:48.520
<v Speaker 1>I want that a seller saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it as much as you want it</v>

93
00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>because the price you're willing to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>me is higher than the price that I,</v>

94
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:57.241
<v Speaker 1>that I you know that I that I need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep it and that's the nature of human</v>

95
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.600
<v Speaker 1>commerce going all the way back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earliest days of human organizing and</v>

96
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 1>understanding that all a market is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggregation of people selling and buying</v>

97
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:13.351
<v Speaker 1>similar things and that our models of</v>
<v Speaker 1>markets are just that they're models.</v>

98
00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Supply and demand don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>

99
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.480
<v Speaker 1>A model of what we see in everyday life</v>
<v Speaker 1>that help us understand everyday life.</v>

100
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.140
<v Speaker 1>When we add you're great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those buyer and seller transactions</v>

101
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:31.141
<v Speaker 1>together and helping students understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>how human society functions,</v>

102
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:35.900
<v Speaker 1>how it naturally self organizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what a market is,</v>

103
00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:39.600
<v Speaker 1>is what a free market economy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because even in the socialist economies</v>

104
00:05:39.601 --> 00:05:42.190
<v Speaker 1>and the communists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those markets existed.</v>

105
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.070
<v Speaker 1>They made my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe weren't tracked officially,</v>

106
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:46.960
<v Speaker 1>but they were there and they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>operating.</v>

107
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>And so when I think about how we bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>that into education,</v>

108
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:53.470
<v Speaker 1>it's how do we help students understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>how humans organize,</v>

109
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who humans interact and bring value to</v>

110
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Love Adam Smith calls it about our</v>

111
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 1>propensity to truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously I never thought of that as</v>

112
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:05.700
<v Speaker 1>a verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

113
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.001
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

114
00:06:06.001 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>and had meaning back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I love that phrase now.</v>

115
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Our propensity to truck is what makes us</v>
<v Speaker 1>different from the,</v>

116
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 1>the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our propensity to engage in transactions</v>

117
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:20.090
<v Speaker 1>of me to sell you something and you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy it so that I don't,</v>

118
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll do the farming and I'll do the</v>

119
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 1>sewing.</v>

120
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 1>And by having this propensity to truck</v>
<v Speaker 1>will each have more wellbeing in our</v>

121
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very simple principle and I</v>

122
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 1>sometimes think that when we use words</v>
<v Speaker 1>like markets and networks,</v>

123
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>things we create an abstraction of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

124
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.480
<v Speaker 1>These are models of how we exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I look out at the world and I</v>

125
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:48.221
<v Speaker 1>see what creates wealth and business by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way for me is organizations and</v>

126
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 1>markets which are both important parts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it and it's organization's operating,</v>

127
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.130
<v Speaker 1>eating as actors in markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

128
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>and I look out at the world and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched.</v>

129
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not the government that's creating</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>

130
00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not the governance that's creating</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>

131
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not the church that's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

132
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:09.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get something done so much</v>

133
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:12.770
<v Speaker 1>faster with a for profit business than</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can with a not for profit or a</v>

134
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:17.771
<v Speaker 1>government or a religious based business</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even an NGO and you can move jobs and</v>

135
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:21.740
<v Speaker 1>move wealth and solve problems so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>

136
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.070
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the dominant social institution.</v>

137
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I like that every day?</v>

138
00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes as it's become the</v>

139
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:34.961
<v Speaker 1>dominant social institution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've allowed market based logics to</v>

140
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 1>dominate our thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm part of how did 2008 occurred?</v>

141
00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:41.150
<v Speaker 1>How did it all your classmates get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>

142
00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:44.780
<v Speaker 1>as you talked about to Wall Street is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because money has become even more</v>

143
00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 1>motivating to us in the age of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business as the dominant social</v>

144
00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:53.681
<v Speaker 1>institution and money is only a metric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Money is only one place of value in life</v>

145
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.440
<v Speaker 1>and if there's a sort of a challenge</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to have,</v>

146
00:07:57.441 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 1>if we're going to recalibrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be as a human on a psyche</v>

147
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:04.820
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding how much business has come</v>

148
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:09.170
<v Speaker 1>to dominate and homogenized and control</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture in some cases and making</v>

149
00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:11.990
<v Speaker 1>conscious decisions about where we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to let that happen and where we're</v>

150
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.570
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

151
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.150
<v Speaker 1>right now we're dealing with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unintended consequences of business</v>

152
00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:21.260
<v Speaker 1>emerging as the dominant social</v>
<v Speaker 1>institution and we're beginning to have</v>

153
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:25.100
<v Speaker 1>dialogues about how do we push that</v>
<v Speaker 1>monetary metric back a little to let</v>

154
00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:26.510
<v Speaker 1>other values on the table.</v>

155
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.270
<v Speaker 1>As a society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both nationally and globally,</v>

156
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.480
<v Speaker 1>markets aren't fair or unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Markets create wealth and they're</v>

157
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:40.481
<v Speaker 1>incredibly efficient at allocating goods</v>
<v Speaker 1>and resources and creating surplus for</v>

158
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:43.670
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes people better off,</v>

159
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.950
<v Speaker 1>but markets have nothing to do with how</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wellbeing gets allocated across</v>

160
00:08:48.951 --> 00:08:52.910
<v Speaker 1>members of society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't argue they're fair or</v>

161
00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:55.320
<v Speaker 1>unfair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're agnostic there,</v>

162
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.870
<v Speaker 1>a moral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not immoral,</v>

163
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 1>amoral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's we as human beings who get to</v>

164
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:06.261
<v Speaker 1>decide how much each person should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>entitled to on a moral and values based</v>

165
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:08.910
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I personally am somebody who</v>

166
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 1>believes the I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that a billion out of the 6</v>

167
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 1>billion of us on the planet live on</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

168
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:18.471
<v Speaker 1>Less than a dollar a day isn't fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't believe that markets can</v>

169
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:23.040
<v Speaker 1>solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do believe they can create more wealth</v>

170
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:24.630
<v Speaker 1>to spread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help solve it.</v>

171
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.860
<v Speaker 1>But if we just allow markets unchecked</v>
<v Speaker 1>and somehow argued that will take care</v>

172
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:31.500
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen no data to indicate that</v>

173
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:34.860
<v Speaker 1>markets will know because they aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing.</v>

174
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:39.720
<v Speaker 1>They're allocating their generative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not loving.</v>

175
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Clearly the service sector is where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>excel on the US economy versus the</v>

176
00:09:47.521 --> 00:09:48.900
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

177
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 1>and so clearly that's going to be and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge based sectors because</v>

178
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:56.700
<v Speaker 1>that's where we have still have a leg up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world in higher education and</v>

179
00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:59.010
<v Speaker 1>people who come out with critical</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking skills.</v>

180
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.260
<v Speaker 1>So clearly those pieces are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead.</v>

181
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Finance is already playing a bigger role</v>
<v Speaker 1>than any of us thought it would,</v>

182
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.200
<v Speaker 1>but I personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of sort of hopes and dreams,</v>

183
00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:11.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that social enterprise is having</v>
<v Speaker 1>more on a small scale,</v>

184
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.150
<v Speaker 1>but there's more vigor in that than I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have guessed five or 10 years ago</v>

185
00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:20.151
<v Speaker 1>and that excites me</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the foreseeable future.</v>

186
00:10:21.271 --> 00:10:24.270
<v Speaker 1>The service sector has eclipsed</v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing and a lot of it's a simple</v>

187
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:28.470
<v Speaker 1>cost argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We cannot manufacturer as economically</v>

188
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.780
<v Speaker 1>in the United States as you can in</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing countries because all kinds</v>

189
00:10:33.781 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 1>of tax reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit reasons and things that we</v>

190
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.790
<v Speaker 1>require and are good for society.</v>

191
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.180
<v Speaker 1>The interesting thing about economics</v>
<v Speaker 1>and markets and the developing the</v>

192
00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:48.840
<v Speaker 1>developed world as we've never played</v>
<v Speaker 1>out this game before at a global scale.</v>

193
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.760
<v Speaker 1>We don't know if there is long term harm</v>
<v Speaker 1>to losing a manufacturing base.</v>

194
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Intuitively it feels very uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unclear where certain sectors of</v>

195
00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:00.780
<v Speaker 1>our society are going to continue to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find employment.</v>

196
00:11:00.781 --> 00:11:04.710
<v Speaker 1>When you drive through Detroit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely scary in some situations</v>

197
00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:08.220
<v Speaker 1>are cities like buffalo that used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have these manufacturing basis,</v>

198
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.010
<v Speaker 1>so I would argue we don't know the</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer to that,</v>

199
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:16.080
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not sure we can fix it right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>until people are willing to not look for</v>

200
00:11:16.081 --> 00:11:19.530
<v Speaker 1>the lowest cost on certain manufactured</v>
<v Speaker 1>goods.</v>

201
00:11:19.531 --> 00:11:24.000
<v Speaker 1>The developed world will win out or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing world as a job space for</v>

202
00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:28.830
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing will win out over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed world and in order for that to</v>

203
00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:32.310
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to change how we buy and how</v>

204
00:11:32.311 --> 00:11:36.450
<v Speaker 1>we consume and it's hard to foresee in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the near future how that's going to</v>

205
00:11:36.451 --> 00:11:37.284
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

206
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.240
<v Speaker 1>So in many ways I don't know that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a choice.</v>

207
00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:41.220
<v Speaker 1>We have to play it out and see what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

208
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.160
<v Speaker 1>The beautiful thing is the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

209
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.310
<v Speaker 1>we didn't even know about it 20 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

210
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.480
<v Speaker 1>even 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody thought it was going to circle</v>

211
00:11:48.481 --> 00:11:50.820
<v Speaker 1>the globe as fast as it did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many,</v>

212
00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where you get your hope and</v>

213
00:11:52.471 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 1>sense of surprise is there may well be</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are going to happen that we</v>

214
00:11:56.771 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 1>can't even imagine that make this</v>
<v Speaker 1>service dominated,</v>

215
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.230
<v Speaker 1>developed economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fondling.</v>

216
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Speaker 1>And what we have to do when I get back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to education is keep educating the</v>

217
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:10.660
<v Speaker 1>thinkers and the innovators and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>critiquers who will help those</v>

218
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:14.590
<v Speaker 1>breakthroughs come to bear because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only hope for human society.</v>

219
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Because at some point the developing</v>
<v Speaker 1>world will have played out this chain as</v>

220
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:19.130
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

221
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.910
<v Speaker 1>and we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have robots manufacturing</v>

222
00:12:21.911 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 1>everything basic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>

223
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 1>what is human life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then?</v>

224
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.460
<v Speaker 1>What is the marketplace?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then?</v>

225
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:31.480
<v Speaker 1>How do we find meaning and value and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>our needs met and feed our families.</v>
