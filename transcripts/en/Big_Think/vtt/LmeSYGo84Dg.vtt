00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.963
<v Speaker 1>My job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not partisan.</v>

3
00:00:06.321 --> 00:00:10.210
<v Speaker 1>So whether Obama was delivering it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not on leave to others or,</v>

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.810
<v Speaker 1>or my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my private thoughts,</v>

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any</v>

6
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.190
<v Speaker 2>buddy running for president and anybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>who serves as president has to do a</v>

7
00:00:18.531 --> 00:00:22.790
<v Speaker 2>variety of the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to call up the very basic,</v>

8
00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:27.440
<v Speaker 2>traditional American ideals and use them</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make an argument about our place in</v>

9
00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:30.230
<v Speaker 2>the world and about public policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.360
<v Speaker 2>certainly Obama has done that a lot and</v>
<v Speaker 2>very effectively in this campaign.</v>

11
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:40.361
<v Speaker 2>He places his campaign in this context</v>
<v Speaker 2>of American history and of American</v>

12
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:46.280
<v Speaker 2>ideals in our quest to live up to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideals in a way that all the greatest</v>

13
00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 2>presidential speeches have done from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln to Roosevelt to,</v>

14
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.580
<v Speaker 2>to Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

15
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:56.810
<v Speaker 2>and that's what you've got to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the John Mccain is not as proficient</v>

16
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.580
<v Speaker 2>a speaker from a prepared text.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has written books and when he's in a</v>

17
00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:03.890
<v Speaker 2>10 meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could talk the same way and make</v>

18
00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:06.590
<v Speaker 2>people really understand how the moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

19
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meets,</v>

20
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.600
<v Speaker 2>meets the moments where the country has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been courageous in the past.</v>

21
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

22
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.190
<v Speaker 1>For Mccain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

23
00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:16.970
<v Speaker 1>the challenge is going to be to step up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to him when he has to get the big formal</v>

24
00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:17.230
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
