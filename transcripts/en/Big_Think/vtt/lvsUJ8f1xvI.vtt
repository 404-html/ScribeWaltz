00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.410
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of funny cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the elections I was at this press</v>

2
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:19.461
<v Speaker 1>conference for Black Youth vote and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking about all the work that we</v>

3
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>did with our campaign powerboat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

4
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>so this article came out with in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Associated Press and basically I had</v>

5
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>said a statement that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>and this really happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:32.940
<v Speaker 1>after the elections,</v>

8
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Fox News and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and white people.</v>

9
00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:40.060
<v Speaker 1>I just knew we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah this is great.</v>

10
00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:42.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism is over now that we have a black</v>

11
00:00:42.191 --> 00:00:43.990
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

12
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.600
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your statement in of itself shows that</v>

13
00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:50.770
<v Speaker 1>racism isn't dead because if it was you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't acknowledge that he was black</v>

14
00:00:50.771 --> 00:00:52.420
<v Speaker 1>in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.150
<v Speaker 1>and so it gotten like 200 different</v>
<v Speaker 1>papers,</v>

16
00:00:58.151 --> 00:01:03.151
<v Speaker 1>like randomly who's like really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I got things like face,</v>

17
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.890
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these blogs,</v>

18
00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:08.350
<v Speaker 1>these conservative bloggers like</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking me.</v>

19
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.570
<v Speaker 1>And that was the first time it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

20
00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.130
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>googling my name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding images and putting it on blogs</v>

22
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:20.481
<v Speaker 1>so they could talk stuff about me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that with like crazy to me.</v>

23
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.953
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

24
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.620
<v Speaker 1>it was like they were upset cause I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audacity to say that no,</v>

25
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:32.670
<v Speaker 1>racism isn't dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even though we Obama won,</v>

26
00:01:32.671 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>we still have to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not just going to be up to</v>

27
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not a superhero.</v>

28
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 1>He is a super motivator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he is motivated our generation to</v>

29
00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:43.561
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

30
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Why not create change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not be the best generation we can</v>

31
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:47.490
<v Speaker 1>be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not,</v>

32
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up for what we believe in.</v>

33
00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Why not just be more successful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not just try harder?</v>

34
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Why not just advocate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not just go into Congress and to</v>

35
00:01:57.631 --> 00:01:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Capitol Hill and lobby our</v>
<v Speaker 1>congresspeople?</v>

36
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's done all that.</v>

37
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.930
<v Speaker 1>But like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not a superhero.</v>

38
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>And so it was funny to me because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were mad that I said racism isn't dead.</v>

39
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Speaker 1>But it was like in their statements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were racist to like,</v>

40
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>one was like niggers are still whining</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

41
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>you're only 23,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you know about racism or all</v>

43
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>these different things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

44
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.313
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

45
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.330
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

46
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:32.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even with Obama in office,</v>

47
00:02:32.581 --> 00:02:37.581
<v Speaker 1>we have a long road ahead of people of</v>
<v Speaker 1>having to just build intercultural</v>

48
00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>politics and intercultural communication</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

49
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 1>is more uplifting and uniting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that as a coalition energy</v>

50
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>action coalition has been working</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

51
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:54.690
<v Speaker 1>really hard to try and develop that as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>

52
00:02:54.691 --> 00:02:56.090
<v Speaker 1>as a true strategic goal.</v>
