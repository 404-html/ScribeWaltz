1
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.520
<v Speaker 1>The Reagan coalition was based on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>alliance between,</v>

2
00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:12.460
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small government,</v>

3
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro big business conservatives on the</v>

4
00:00:14.561 --> 00:00:17.830
<v Speaker 1>one hand and the kind of cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentments,</v>

5
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.320
<v Speaker 1>especially among white working class</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans on the other,</v>

6
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.580
<v Speaker 1>they held those together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very reliable way for the</v>

7
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Republican Party to retain national</v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

8
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.640
<v Speaker 1>I think that's common glued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's come unglued for a variety of</v>

9
00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:33.470
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>2008 being one of them and the</v>

10
00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Republicans had not much to offer their</v>
<v Speaker 1>working class,</v>

11
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>followers except what more tax cuts,</v>

12
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut social security.</v>

13
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean Donald Trump understood that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the reasons that he was</v>

14
00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:45.820
<v Speaker 1>able to come in and take the part tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nomination for himself.</v>

15
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.900
<v Speaker 1>He understood the class aspects of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this in a way that the republican</v>

16
00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 1>establishment just did not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were coming forward with the</v>

17
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:54.070
<v Speaker 1>all the old bromides.</v>

18
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he came along and said,</v>

19
00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:55.541
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

20
00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:56.171
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

21
00:00:56.171 --> 00:00:58.300
<v Speaker 1>the tax issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can even compromise the tax</v>

22
00:00:58.301 --> 00:00:59.200
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minimum wage.</v>

23
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not such a bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but free trade,</v>

24
00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:02.320
<v Speaker 1>free trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free trade.</v>

25
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be the man who can make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>deals now that is not the typical</v>

26
00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:09.610
<v Speaker 1>republican establishment or even the</v>
<v Speaker 1>typical republican line.</v>

27
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was able to look,</v>

28
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.120
<v Speaker 1>he was able to move to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

29
00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:14.980
<v Speaker 1>So he's on the left of the Republican</v>
<v Speaker 1>Party.</v>

30
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.420
<v Speaker 1>He's more like Bernie Sanders in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways on some issues than he is like the</v>

31
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Republican Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

32
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:21.580
<v Speaker 1>he's doing all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:22.900
<v Speaker 1>the xenophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the racism,</v>

34
00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:24.700
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where is the,</v>

35
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.830
<v Speaker 1>the center to all of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

36
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.600
<v Speaker 1>which is really what makes him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

37
00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:31.120
<v Speaker 1>and this is where the Clinton people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be very concerned.</v>

38
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.830
<v Speaker 1>It makes them a very unpredictable</v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate.</v>

39
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.180
<v Speaker 1>It makes it very difficult to gauge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of knew what you were getting</v>

40
00:01:37.181 --> 00:01:39.370
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly if Jeb Bush had gotten the</v>

41
00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:42.820
<v Speaker 1>nomination or if Ted Cruz had gotten the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nomination to very different people,</v>

42
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>you kind of knew what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

43
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 1>what was there with trump who cheat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who changed position that he held at</v>

44
00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:51.280
<v Speaker 1>nine o'clock in the morning with great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:54.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm great fervor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can change it all by four o'clock in</v>

46
00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:55.360
<v Speaker 1>the afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

47
00:01:55.361 --> 00:01:57.760
<v Speaker 1>this makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not dealing in a fact based</v>

48
00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:00.490
<v Speaker 1>universe here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're dealing in reality television.</v>

49
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.020
<v Speaker 1>It's something that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that no political consultant I think is</v>

50
00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:07.360
<v Speaker 1>quite figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he becomes president,</v>

51
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.270
<v Speaker 1>will he be able to do everything that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>says he's going to do?</v>

52
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do have still have a constitution.</v>

53
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.490
<v Speaker 1>If you suspends the Constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

54
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.250
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine and some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

55
00:02:18.251 --> 00:02:19.330
<v Speaker 1>some fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

56
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.210
<v Speaker 1>We were under great attack or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he suspends the Constitution.</v>

57
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Well then we have a crisis that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>never faced as a country before except</v>

58
00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:28.120
<v Speaker 1>possibly in the case of obsession in</v>
<v Speaker 1>1860,</v>

59
00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:29.330
<v Speaker 1>61,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

60
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.400
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.250
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a constitutional crisis that</v>

62
00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:37.030
<v Speaker 1>ended up with 750,000 military dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

63
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go through that again.</v>

64
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Can trump do whatever he wants as</v>
<v Speaker 1>president?</v>

65
00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Can he become a dictator only by</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspending the constitution of the</v>

66
00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:46.270
<v Speaker 1>United States under the constitution</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean that I'd say there are plenty of</v>

67
00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:48.490
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plenty of checks and balances on him.</v>

68
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Not as much as you might like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the military.</v>

69
00:02:51.311 --> 00:02:52.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is commander in chief.</v>

70
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.040
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.050
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be a crisis presidency.</v>

72
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you one of these movements</v>

73
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 1>and they've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

74
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>they've occurred before in American</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

75
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>There's always an argument that somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody has taken America away from</v>

76
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Americans and we're going to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it back,</v>

77
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 1>take it back from them and restore what</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

78
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened with the federalists in</v>

79
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>1800 of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural unnatural as immigrants.</v>

80
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>It happened in the 1850s with Irish</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants and you know,</v>

81
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Catholic immigrants and German Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Irish and German Catholic</v>

82
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's happening now.</v>

83
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something terrible has been taken away</v>

84
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>and they're trying to bring it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's appealing to people's fears.</v>

85
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>They're appealing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing to people's sense of,</v>

86
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

87
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>appealing to people's sense that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are no longer,</v>

88
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.920
<v Speaker 1>they no longer count,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

89
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.780
<v Speaker 1>these appealing to people's sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

90
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their resentments and grievances.</v>

91
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>But we've seen that before as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

92
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 1>this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing new about any of this.</v>

93
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually a sign or it's been a sign</v>

94
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 1>of a political party that's about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cracked up.</v>

95
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that certainly happened in 1800.</v>

96
00:03:58.841 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>It happened in the 1850s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1920s and thirties.</v>

97
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.140
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

98
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>the old guard and the Republican Party</v>
<v Speaker 1>that brought back the economics that led</v>

99
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:08.720
<v Speaker 1>to the Great Depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they too,</v>

100
00:04:08.721 --> 00:04:11.140
<v Speaker 1>are being bought up by a resurgence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nativism,</v>

101
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.590
<v Speaker 1>which led to a law in 1924 that grossly</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy restricted immigration from</v>

102
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 1>abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In all three cases,</v>

103
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>the parties either collect entirely or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were marginalized.</v>

104
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 1>The Republicans didn't elect a president</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Franklin Delano Roosevelt coming in</v>

105
00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 1>in 1932 until 30 years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

106
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.601
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

107
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:32.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president,</v>

108
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 1>they elected in 1952,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dwight Eisenhower basically ratified a</v>

109
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 1>new deal consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

110
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.320
<v Speaker 1>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this great,</v>

111
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm making America great again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually means that a party's about to</v>

112
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:45.370
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get under,</v>

113
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall under great pressure.</v>

114
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to,</v>

115
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 1>if not collapsing target,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least it's going to disintegrate or</v>

116
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 1>be pushed to the margins.</v>
