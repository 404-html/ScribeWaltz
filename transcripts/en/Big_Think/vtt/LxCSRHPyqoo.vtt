1
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.403
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a bad idea when people try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to design ways to create a public life,</v>

3
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 2>a public square that's free of religion</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the religion talk because there are</v>

4
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:19.260
<v Speaker 2>people from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how they're comfortable talking.</v>

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 2>Some people like Tom to economic theory</v>
<v Speaker 2>or some people have a historical view of</v>

6
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people have a view of the world</v>

7
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:29.430
<v Speaker 2>that comes from their faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People's views come all different</v>

8
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.290
<v Speaker 2>sources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important to have a public</v>

9
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:36.291
<v Speaker 2>square that embraces these different</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways of looking at the world and if</v>

10
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 2>there's something that I believe about</v>
<v Speaker 2>public life that's really it,</v>

11
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 2>that it ought to be open and we ought to</v>
<v Speaker 2>really try to have actual dialogue and</v>

12
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:48.741
<v Speaker 2>think about dialogue to make it real is</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to engage in listening with our</v>

13
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:52.370
<v Speaker 2>ears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we tend to do in America is listen</v>

14
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.213
<v Speaker 2>with our mouths.</v>

15
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 2>We tend to listen to the other fellows</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument for the sole purpose of</v>

16
00:00:56.761 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 2>spotting the errors so we can refute it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The absurdity that they call</v>

17
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 2>presidential debates in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are not debates at all,</v>

18
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 2>but joint press conference is run by and</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the media.</v>

19
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 2>I think candidates should avoid them</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the plague.</v>

20
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 2>They're horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that absurdity captures what I mean.</v>

21
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.910
<v Speaker 2>There's no time there for a measured</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

22
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 2>There's no time there to explain a</v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

23
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 2>All you have time do is lash out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call somebody's name,</v>

24
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 2>use the right buzzwords in it's somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>else's turn.</v>

25
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not democracy.</v>

26
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 2>That's a mockery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is simply a,</v>

27
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 2>an excuse for avoiding what we really</v>
<v Speaker 2>need,</v>

28
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 2>which is actual conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

29
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.680
<v Speaker 2>our differences instead of buzzwords and</v>
<v Speaker 2>name calling across our differences.</v>

30
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.120
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
