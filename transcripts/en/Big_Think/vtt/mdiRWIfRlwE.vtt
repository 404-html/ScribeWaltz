00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.850
<v Speaker 1>When I was a child growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I expected that we would have robots by</v>

2
00:00:03.851 --> 00:00:07.390
<v Speaker 1>this point c three Po and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we still don't,</v>

3
00:00:07.391 --> 00:00:11.170
<v Speaker 1>in fact the smartest thing that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the Roomba vacuum cleaner.</v>

4
00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>And so that means it's something went</v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly wrong with ai and,</v>

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.920
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it forces us to ask what went wrong</v>

6
00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:21.130
<v Speaker 1>because essentially we've been throwing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smartest people on the planet at</v>

7
00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:24.670
<v Speaker 1>that problem since the 60s and it's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>a failed problem.</v>

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer I think clearly is that we</v>

9
00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:30.640
<v Speaker 1>have to listen to what mother nature is</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

10
00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:33.070
<v Speaker 1>So since the 60s people have thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

11
00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:34.030
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all this wet,</v>

12
00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>biological gushy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's put that aside and just figuring</v>

13
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:41.380
<v Speaker 1>out what would intelligence take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we just do this from scratch?</v>

14
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.160
<v Speaker 1>And that hasn't gotten us anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The game now is shifting to saying,</v>

15
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.800
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is mother nature accomplishing it?</v>

16
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.850
<v Speaker 1>The reason ai got stuck is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>programmers have been saying,</v>

17
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.920
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we solve this part of the</v>

18
00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:57.340
<v Speaker 1>problem and then solve this little part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the problem and this part of the</v>

19
00:00:57.341 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

20
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.540
<v Speaker 1>if you have a robot and you want it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up wooden blocks and stack them,</v>

21
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.660
<v Speaker 1>programmers have traditionally tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

22
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:08.710
<v Speaker 1>let's solve the find the block problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then let's,</v>

23
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.470
<v Speaker 1>once we've done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine solve the pickup,</v>

24
00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:13.240
<v Speaker 1>the block problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the stack,</v>

25
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.160
<v Speaker 1>the block problem and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this sort of division of labor seems</v>

26
00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.830
<v Speaker 1>like a pretty good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's never really gotten us</v>

27
00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:23.230
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference with what Mother Nature</v>

28
00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:27.280
<v Speaker 1>does is she doesn't come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions to problems and then tick the</v>

29
00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:30.430
<v Speaker 1>box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The brain is a,</v>

30
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.980
<v Speaker 1>an end product of a chronic process of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinvention that,</v>

31
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 1>that Mother Nature always does.</v>

32
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.090
<v Speaker 1>So there's no single solution to</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

33
00:01:40.091 --> 00:01:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain is this collection of</v>

34
00:01:42.761 --> 00:01:47.761
<v Speaker 1>subpopulations that all solve problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>and overlapping ways.</v>

35
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.830
<v Speaker 1>There's no single solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

36
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the detection of motion by the visual</v>

37
00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:57.040
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not just one way that the brain</v>

38
00:01:57.041 --> 00:01:59.020
<v Speaker 1>does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are multiple ways that were</v>

39
00:01:59.021 --> 00:02:02.500
<v Speaker 1>invented at different points in</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary history and they all,</v>

40
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.070
<v Speaker 1>they all weigh in on the same problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>using different mechanisms.</v>

41
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Same with memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a single memory system.</v>

42
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.730
<v Speaker 1>There are lots of ways that memories get</v>
<v Speaker 1>written in the brain.</v>

43
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.790
<v Speaker 1>If we want to solve the AI problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to do at the same way that</v>

44
00:02:15.791 --> 00:02:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Mother Nature did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is build a machine that runs on</v>

45
00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:23.170
<v Speaker 1>conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that runs on reinventing solutions and</v>

46
00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>having overlapping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

47
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.050
<v Speaker 1>solutions of the problem space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

48
00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:34.051
<v Speaker 1>I think is our best hope for unlogged</v>
<v Speaker 1>jamming the field of artificial</v>

49
00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:34.780
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
