00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>I sat down to write this essay was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing I ever wrote that wasn't</v>

2
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.090
<v Speaker 1>preschool to make sense to myself of why</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so hard for women to say what</v>

3
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:28.020
<v Speaker 1>they felt or thought and be heard</v>
<v Speaker 1>without having it distorted and come</v>

4
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:31.800
<v Speaker 1>back to them in some way that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even sound like what they were</v>

5
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>trying to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also how come I hadn't seen the</v>

6
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>absence of women from the psychology I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was teaching,</v>

7
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I thought maybe my mother would read</v>

8
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>this book or people who worked on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same floor.</v>

9
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>I worked on it at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never occurred to me,</v>

10
00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:55.221
<v Speaker 1>but I wrote this paper and it started to</v>
<v Speaker 1>circulate like almost as a kind of</v>

11
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 1>underground thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was.</v>

12
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>That was a huge discovery for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just really huge.</v>

13
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:03.630
<v Speaker 1>I didn't expect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard press,</v>

14
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>when they publish the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they publish 3000 copies.</v>

15
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Nobody expected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's had a huge impact.</v>

16
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>It's had a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

17
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you would like one good</v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

18
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>which is women used to be seen as</v>
<v Speaker 1>unintelligent because we were set to be</v>

19
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.900
<v Speaker 1>emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

20
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>men were rational and women were</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional.</v>

21
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.920
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about,</v>

23
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous because men have</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings and women thing.</v>

24
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.800
<v Speaker 1>So now we have this I phrase emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and it's a big vaunted</v>

25
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 1>phrase because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>corporations are supposed to incorporate</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and people forget that.</v>

27
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Where that came from was this word</v>
<v Speaker 1>questioning this division between</v>

28
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>emotional women and intelligent humans</v>
<v Speaker 1>and saying,</v>

29
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.160
<v Speaker 1>when you joined these qualities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had been seen as women's qualities</v>

30
00:01:56.161 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>with human qualities there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are all human quality.</v>

31
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:03.831
<v Speaker 1>So we have emotional intelligence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>relational self and most recently the</v>

32
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 1>feeling brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that the whole paradigm.</v>
