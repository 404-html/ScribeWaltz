00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:05.791
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:06.530
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.410
<v Speaker 1>when I was at the paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.250
<v Speaker 1>I would let my assistant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arthur Bovino very good journalists,</v>

5
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and I would,</v>

6
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.680
<v Speaker 1>we had a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would both read the paper before we</v>

7
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 1>came to work and we would bet on what</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the mail going to be about,</v>

8
00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:20.660
<v Speaker 1>what were people going to be complaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

9
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.150
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within a couple of months we knew</v>

10
00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:24.860
<v Speaker 1>exactly what people would be complaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

11
00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:28.610
<v Speaker 1>We learned how the average times reader</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not even the average time sort of the</v>

12
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.430
<v Speaker 1>times readers in general responded to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the newspaper.</v>

13
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.880
<v Speaker 1>So I began to respond that way and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would see things that would irritate me</v>

14
00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:37.400
<v Speaker 1>that I might not have noticed at an</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier time.</v>

15
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I tried to stop doing that when I left</v>
<v Speaker 1>the paper.</v>

16
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:44.630
<v Speaker 1>And I've been pretty good about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only time that I really wanted to go</v>

17
00:00:44.631 --> 00:00:47.600
<v Speaker 1>and grab somebody around the neck was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Duke Lacrosse case.</v>

18
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.810
<v Speaker 1>And I'm happy to save it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud to say I gave a speech to the</v>

19
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.110
<v Speaker 1>journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalism fellows at Harvard,</v>

20
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while that was breaking barriers within</v>

21
00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:00.770
<v Speaker 1>the first month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

22
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This journalism is not good journalism</v>

23
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.380
<v Speaker 1>and this is something where a story is</v>
<v Speaker 1>being blown up to much larger scale than</v>

24
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 1>it deserves to be because it fits so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many preconceptions of so many of the</v>

25
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:15.410
<v Speaker 1>editors at the Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

26
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:17.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was white over black,</v>

27
00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:19.490
<v Speaker 1>it was rich over pour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was educated over an educated,</v>

28
00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:21.020
<v Speaker 1>it was male over female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aha,</v>

29
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.050
<v Speaker 1>let's go do something about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

30
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.110
<v Speaker 1>because the times did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that led to everybody else doing it.</v>

31
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.920
<v Speaker 1>So Newsweek does a cover story that</v>
<v Speaker 1>never would've happened had not,</v>

32
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.260
<v Speaker 1>the times has been putting it on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>front page for several days.</v>

33
00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:36.200
<v Speaker 1>So that was driving me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

34
00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:38.210
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't my job any longer to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cop.</v>

35
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:39.830
<v Speaker 1>So I left that to my successor.</v>

36
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest problems confronting the</v>

37
00:01:44.621 --> 00:01:46.270
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically we at the same problems as</v>

38
00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:49.000
<v Speaker 1>providing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confronting everybody in the news</v>

39
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:50.740
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that people don't seem to be</v>

40
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.280
<v Speaker 1>willing to pay for their news or let me</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn that around.</v>

41
00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:57.940
<v Speaker 1>I think the times it seems very</v>
<v Speaker 1>reluctant to charge people for the news,</v>

42
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.340
<v Speaker 1>although they have announced that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to begin charging,</v>

43
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>

44
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in early 2011.</v>

45
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still sense of trepidation and I wish</v>

46
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:08.050
<v Speaker 1>it were otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish they had more confidence.</v>

47
00:02:08.051 --> 00:02:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I think that it may be hard for this</v>
<v Speaker 1>regional paper,</v>

48
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.040
<v Speaker 1>that metropolitan paper or the small</v>
<v Speaker 1>town paper to charge for news,</v>

49
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.640
<v Speaker 1>but I think the times can get away with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because it is the,</v>

50
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.670
<v Speaker 1>for a large portion of the educated</v>
<v Speaker 1>populace,</v>

51
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.170
<v Speaker 1>it is the authoritative voice on what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in the world.</v>

52
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:27.551 --> 00:02:29.650
<v Speaker 1>there are something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many tens of,</v>

54
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it's now over 10 million people.</v>

55
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Let me restate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

56
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.090
<v Speaker 1>there are millions of people who go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that website every day,</v>

57
00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:40.510
<v Speaker 1>all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you started charging $10 a month,</v>

58
00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:41.830
<v Speaker 1>would a lot of them stop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

59
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Would all of them stop note would 50%</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop?</v>

60
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I did the math not long ago and I</v>

61
00:02:46.691 --> 00:02:49.900
<v Speaker 1>think that if 20% of them stayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would cover the cost of the</v>

62
00:02:49.901 --> 00:02:54.901
<v Speaker 1>newsroom and what the people in the news</v>
<v Speaker 1>business seem reluctant to realize is</v>

63
00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>that's the only thing that matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that it's the production of news</v>

64
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>being rewarded with revenue to cover the</v>
<v Speaker 1>costs and perhaps produce a profit.</v>

65
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>That's what counts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The making of a newspaper isn't what</v>

66
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 1>counts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you know,</v>

67
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.331
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

68
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody had gone to the newspaper</v>

69
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Publishers and magazine Publishers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>America 20 years ago and said,</v>

70
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>I have a new business model for you.</v>

71
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>No paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no ink,</v>

72
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.670
<v Speaker 1>no trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no teamsters,</v>

73
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>no pressman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no printer's Union,</v>

74
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>no newsstands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd say,</v>

75
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>give it to me tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is heaven.</v>

76
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>We just want to put our words and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures out there.</v>

77
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 1>But they were so intent on protecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the current revenue stream.</v>

78
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 1>The money that advertisers pay and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>money that individuals pay for the</v>

79
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 1>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they didn't see that this was a</v>

80
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>boon for them and they made the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake that the music business made in</v>

81
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 1>the music business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost control of their industry.</v>

82
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 1>They lost control of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Steve Jobs,</v>

83
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>because they want it to continue to sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>cds for $15 each.</v>

84
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the same thing's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in the print business.</v>

85
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to see that the times is</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving,</v>

86
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 1>and I think once the times moves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many other institutions will move as</v>

87
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charge people for your product if</v>

88
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 1>they're not willing to pay for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you've got a problem with your</v>

89
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:06.154
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

90
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
