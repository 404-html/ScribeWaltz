1
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I think that that dig is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very much,</v>

3
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing thing that is impossible to</v>

5
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>kind of wrap your head around in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know what's going to happen on</v>

6
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>the side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the things that</v>

7
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>brings a lot of people back to the side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think that when you take a look</v>

8
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I wake up in the morning,</v>

9
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same feeling in my gut that I</v>

10
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>three and a half years ago and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell's in the front page like I</v>

12
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 1>have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.060
<v Speaker 1>and it's that freaky kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.630
<v Speaker 1>you never know what you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get and it's always a,</v>

16
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>tends to be interesting and kind of gems</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you wouldn't find anywhere else.</v>

17
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's unique and what keeps</v>

18
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.100
<v Speaker 1>people coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

19
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.680
<v Speaker 1>To,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring people together and get them</v>

20
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>talking and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.990
<v Speaker 1>outside of the online community is a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal and it's something that we would</v>

22
00:01:04.991 --> 00:01:06.880
<v Speaker 1>like to continue to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

23
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important for the company,</v>

24
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to get users some face</v>

25
00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:14.440
<v Speaker 1>time with you so they can give you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>share their ideas,</v>

26
00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.690
<v Speaker 1>their feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

27
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.100
<v Speaker 1>it's so much better than just an email</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in.</v>

28
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's important as we kind of</v>

29
00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>evolve our side as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that we'll be</v>

31
00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>launching in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>is our stories suggest feature and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call it our recommendation engine and</v>

33
00:01:33.791 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a piece of software that analyzes</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the gigs that are happening in</v>

34
00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:41.410
<v Speaker 1>real time across the site and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>compares you to other users.</v>

35
00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:43.360
<v Speaker 1>So you may be dig number 3000 on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

36
00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:46.000
<v Speaker 1>but who were those other 2,999 people.</v>

37
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.730
<v Speaker 1>And what else are they finding that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might also find interesting?</v>

38
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.800
<v Speaker 1>So when we start to do these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can surface stories very early on</v>

39
00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>before they become popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

40
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.720
<v Speaker 1>that we can kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our own heads,</v>

41
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.480
<v Speaker 1>hopefully predict that they will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.600
<v Speaker 1>become very popular stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda this weird game,</v>

43
00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>this kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call it behind the scenes,</v>

44
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.320
<v Speaker 1>we call them like a pressure users,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like users,</v>

45
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:11.980
<v Speaker 1>they can predict the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tastemakers and news.</v>

46
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really interesting because as</v>

47
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:17.290
<v Speaker 1>we start to surface these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

48
00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:22.291
<v Speaker 1>we also are finding likeminded</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals and so in the future on dig,</v>

49
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.790
<v Speaker 1>not only we will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

50
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we realize you've been digging stories</v>

51
00:02:26.651 --> 00:02:30.160
<v Speaker 1>about a oolong tea in the R,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's some awesome stories that you</v>

52
00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:31.720
<v Speaker 1>might find interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

53
00:02:31.721 --> 00:02:35.410
<v Speaker 1>here's 10 other users that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly agreeing with that you had no</v>

54
00:02:35.411 --> 00:02:38.350
<v Speaker 1>idea you were agreeing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're gonna start making those</v>

55
00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:39.880
<v Speaker 1>introductions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

56
00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:42.100
<v Speaker 1>and once we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we want to have meetups and get</v>

57
00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:43.450
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's things where people can come out</v>

58
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:44.141
<v Speaker 1>and say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

59
00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:45.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoyed that story that you</v>

60
00:02:45.581 --> 00:02:47.200
<v Speaker 1>submitted and like make those</v>
<v Speaker 1>connections,</v>

61
00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:49.300
<v Speaker 1>those real world connections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

62
00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:50.380
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

63
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.320
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty cool and it's fun and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully we'll have that feature out in</v>

64
00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:54.220
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a few months.</v>

65
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>What it comes down to is the quality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>content and who's writing the articles.</v>

66
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that if,</v>

67
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>if dig has done anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really leveled the playing field,</v>

68
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for traditional media.</v>

69
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:07.721
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>a story can come from the New York Times</v>
<v Speaker 1>or from somebody whose blog that they</v>

71
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>run out of their basement and receive a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same amount of traffic,</v>

72
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

73
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

74
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>which is insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just wasn't possible a few years</v>

75
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

76
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>to think that there could be a story on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the front page of the New York Times</v>

77
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:26.880
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't get as much traffic as</v>

78
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 1>some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's blog that makes the front page</v>

79
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>of Digg is just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's great because really what it's</v>

80
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:37.141
<v Speaker 1>doing is it's saying it's really not</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the one destination so much as it</v>

81
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 1>is about the quality of the article and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story that's being presented right</v>

82
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 1>and what people want to read.</v>

83
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

84
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.120
<v Speaker 1>for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a lot of people in traditional</v>

86
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:49.940
<v Speaker 1>media writers that have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

87
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my blog is now popular enough to where</v>

88
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm receiving enough ad revenue where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could consider doing this full time.</v>

89
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:59.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can leave my nine to five and say,</v>

90
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my blog,</v>

91
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:03.600
<v Speaker 1>this is who I am as a writer and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

92
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's been several people malick</v>

93
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 1>who wrote for a business to Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left and started his own,</v>

94
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>a network of blog sites that are doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite well.</v>

95
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.750
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>I think it just gives people more</v>
<v Speaker 1>options in the future.</v>

97
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:19.550
<v Speaker 1>But I mean quality will always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always prevail.</v>

98
00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.150
<v Speaker 1>And I think that there's going to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 1>place in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in need for that and there's going to be</v>

100
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.700
<v Speaker 1>a need for people that do the deep dive</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to news and,</v>

101
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact checking and the people that</v>

102
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 1>they're still going to need to need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be teams around certain types of</v>

103
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

104
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 1>and that's always going to survive.</v>

105
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 1>The deep dive is being defined slightly</v>
<v Speaker 1>differently now than,</v>

106
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.560
<v Speaker 1>than it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

107
00:04:45.561 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think about the way that a</v>

108
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Speaker 1>traditional newspapers would do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have a team working on a</v>

109
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:53.140
<v Speaker 1>story that would follow that story</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout its lifespan.</v>

110
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do the follow ups,</v>

111
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 1>the fact checking and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now all of these users that are editors</v>

112
00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:00.060
<v Speaker 1>on dig and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

113
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 1>by editors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean registered users that submit</v>

114
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones that are doing the fact</v>

115
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:05.134
<v Speaker 1>checking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

116
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.240
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have stories every single day that</v>

117
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 1>are marked and flagged as an accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

118
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a story that submitted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hits the front page and the users,</v>

119
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.860
<v Speaker 1>they have different barry options and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go and they do the research and</v>

120
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've checked the different sites and</v>

121
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:16.781
<v Speaker 1>then say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

122
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't add up.</v>

123
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.550
<v Speaker 1>They'll submit it in the comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll oftentimes submit a followup</v>

124
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>story and the flag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the articles inaccurate and they'll say</v>

125
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:25.170
<v Speaker 1>that right at the top of the article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

126
00:05:25.171 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>that happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

127
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.821
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

128
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>

129
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.260
<v Speaker 1>it really comes down to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

130
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.051
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

131
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:33.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's going away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is,</v>

132
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:35.200
<v Speaker 1>it's slightly evolving when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>dig,</v>

133
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>but traditional websites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we'll still have that,</v>

134
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they need that for their own</v>

135
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:42.940
<v Speaker 1>kind of a set of stories in their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal site,</v>

136
00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:44.260
<v Speaker 1>their own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own branded site.</v>

137
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for us it's very much this living</v>

138
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 1>and breathing thing that happens on dig</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

139
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>store will come up and then there'll be</v>

140
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 1>a rebuttal to that story that comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 1>a few hours later and it's constant news</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just getting pushed down.</v>

142
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.840
<v Speaker 1>So it's just the way that we do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in discussions that we have with</v>

143
00:06:03.391 --> 00:06:05.070
<v Speaker 1>traditional media when they come in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

144
00:06:05.071 --> 00:06:06.750
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.480
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get phone calls and say,</v>

146
00:06:09.481 --> 00:06:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you meet with us?</v>

147
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.960
<v Speaker 1>We just want to sit down and have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation about where things are</v>

148
00:06:12.961 --> 00:06:14.760
<v Speaker 1>headed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

149
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.720
<v Speaker 1>we sit down and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

150
00:06:15.721 --> 00:06:18.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you guys have just exploded on</v>

151
00:06:18.121 --> 00:06:22.140
<v Speaker 1>the scene and now you're the second or</v>
<v Speaker 1>third highest a referral traffic to our</v>

152
00:06:22.141 --> 00:06:24.900
<v Speaker 1>site and we just want to know how can we</v>
<v Speaker 1>work with you better?</v>

153
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.310
<v Speaker 1>And I think that one of the things I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>dig will do in the future,</v>

154
00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:32.430
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of refined some of these tools</v>
<v Speaker 1>for these publisher sites and say,</v>

155
00:06:32.431 --> 00:06:34.470
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what type of information can we give</v>

156
00:06:34.471 --> 00:06:38.540
<v Speaker 1>them a tool to make to really inform</v>
<v Speaker 1>their writers and,</v>

157
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:39.131
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

158
00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:44.050
<v Speaker 1>and educate them about what the masses</v>
<v Speaker 1>are wanting and really shortening kind</v>

159
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.600
<v Speaker 1>of the feedback loop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.240
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really about the message that</v>

161
00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:52.200
<v Speaker 1>they're getting from their readers in</v>
<v Speaker 1>real time as opposed to printing</v>

162
00:06:52.201 --> 00:06:54.180
<v Speaker 1>something and just hoping people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to like it,</v>

163
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.940
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

164
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are tools that we're working</v>

165
00:06:58.051 --> 00:07:01.530
<v Speaker 1>on and stuff that we'll have out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

166
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.700
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't really say,</v>

167
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.630
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 more about that.</v>

168
00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:04.200
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
