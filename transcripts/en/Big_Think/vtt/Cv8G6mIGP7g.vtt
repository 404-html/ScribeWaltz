00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I think this is one of the major</v>
<v Speaker 1>unknowns about Obama.</v>

2
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.420
<v Speaker 1>He in some ways has to succeed within a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very traditional broadcast style of</v>

3
00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:24.951
<v Speaker 1>politics and governance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's also the outlines of the new</v>

4
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:32.250
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the new part is coming from</v>

5
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.700
<v Speaker 1>a fact that's actually even bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama and our preoccupations in</v>

6
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.180
<v Speaker 1>electoral politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the,</v>

7
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.460
<v Speaker 1>the falling costs for people with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same interest to share information and</v>

8
00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>collaborate and find each other in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>

9
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>That is what's changing the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the falling cost for likeminded people</v>

10
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 1>or locate each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>share information,</v>

11
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.600
<v Speaker 1>do something with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then tell the rest of the world.</v>

12
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.770
<v Speaker 1>And whether you are campaign recognizes</v>
<v Speaker 1>it or not,</v>

13
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 1>that is out there and it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's no doubt that an American</v>

14
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:20.091
<v Speaker 1>government realizing this shift could</v>
<v Speaker 1>operate in a different way than our</v>

15
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>government does now.</v>

16
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>And there are people who want to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>that transition happen,</v>

17
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:35.001
<v Speaker 1>who want to see the age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not an internet fundraising and</v>

18
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 1>organizing a campaign over the web,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something much more profound,</v>

19
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.800
<v Speaker 1>which would be government of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the people.</v>

20
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>And for the people in which the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually have the same information</v>

21
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>available to them that the government</v>
<v Speaker 1>has</v>

22
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.840
<v Speaker 1>and that kind of openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of transparency is certainly</v>

23
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:03.621
<v Speaker 1>going to change government eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we really don't know if the election</v>

24
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>of Obama would bring it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't really don't know at all if he</v>

25
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:13.941
<v Speaker 1>would govern any differently then Bill</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton or for that matter George Bush,</v>

26
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's there as a kind of a,</v>

27
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.390
<v Speaker 1>as a kind of a under tone</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as potential,</v>

28
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.080
<v Speaker 1>but the rest remains to be seen and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have this problem about talking about</v>

29
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:35.781
<v Speaker 1>change when it comes to technology and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these big shifts is we ask,</v>

30
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's going to be one or the</v>

31
00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Speaker 1>other where we ask it if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.740
<v Speaker 1>the Internet is taking over or really</v>
<v Speaker 1>not much of a factor at all is we have</v>

33
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>to have some more complex images here.</v>

34
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like they're still running</v>

35
00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>the old stadium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're building the new one writer,</v>

36
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right around it.</v>

37
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>And how we function in both worlds at</v>
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

38
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>The old broadcasting system is still</v>
<v Speaker 1>there for much of the country and much</v>

39
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>of the campaign is being run through it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then underneath it or around it,</v>

40
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>there's this new distributed system of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of many to many of the politics and</v>

41
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 1>media and it the two interact with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

42
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>So I think we're going to continue to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that.</v>
