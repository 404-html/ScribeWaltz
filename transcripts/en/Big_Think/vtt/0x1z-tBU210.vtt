1
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 1>One of the great things about the liver </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it regenerates,</v>

2
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:17.380
<v Speaker 1>so if you cut out somebody half of </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's liver,</v>

3
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.363
<v Speaker 1>it grows back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we can now not only use </v>

4
00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:22.550
<v Speaker 1>cadaver livers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can use,</v>

5
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.360
<v Speaker 1>we can use portions of living donors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.570
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

7
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's work being done in this area</v>

8
00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:32.344
<v Speaker 1>that in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a liver transplant will be no more than </v>

9
00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:36.574
<v Speaker 1>an injection of a number of cells that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will implant somewhere in the body and </v>

10
00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:42.124
<v Speaker 1>will grow and form an entire new liver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the whole area of stem cell </v>

11
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>transplantation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 1>and then I think the last area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.060
<v Speaker 1>and this is a fairly controversial area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think has great potential,</v>

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.801
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

15
00:00:56.801 --> 00:00:59.530
<v Speaker 1>and the background here is that as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>may be aware,</v>

16
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.800
<v Speaker 1>there are many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly with liver disease,</v>

17
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.580
<v Speaker 1>many more people that need livers than </v>
<v Speaker 1>we currently have livers for.</v>

18
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.463
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole area called </v>

19
00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:14.851
<v Speaker 1>xenotransplantation in which the idea is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we would take animals,</v>

20
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.903
<v Speaker 1>pigs big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>currently the preferred animal and be </v>

21
00:01:22.661 --> 00:01:23.494
<v Speaker 1>able to modify them genetically in such </v>
<v Speaker 1>a way that a human would not only not </v>

22
00:01:29.111 --> 00:01:29.944
<v Speaker 1>reject a pig liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that any potential diseases that </v>

23
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>would be unique to a animals would not </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to be contracted by a human.</v>

24
00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:45.020
<v Speaker 1>This is a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big concern right now that,</v>

25
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.560
<v Speaker 1>that you could envision 20 years from </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

26
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 1>everyone who needs a liver having access</v>
<v Speaker 1>to one because you would walk into,</v>

27
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just as,</v>

28
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm just imagine you walk into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>facility,</v>

29
00:01:56.171 --> 00:01:59.290
<v Speaker 1>you take out a pig and you'll use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pig liver for the,</v>

30
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.840
<v Speaker 1>for the patient or the pig pen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

31
00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I think technical advances in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

33
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.593
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leading to minimally increasingly </v>

34
00:02:10.121 --> 00:02:12.870
<v Speaker 1>minimally invasive surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.013
<v Speaker 1>a new drugs and ultimately a sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the immune system that </v>

36
00:02:20.201 --> 00:02:22.880
<v Speaker 1>no drugs would be necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.333
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the use of cells rather than whole </v>

38
00:02:26.651 --> 00:02:31.640
<v Speaker 1>organs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And potentially the use of animal organs</v>

39
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.483
<v Speaker 1>are probably the four areas of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future with when it comes to to solid </v>

40
00:02:37.961 --> 00:02:38.794
<v Speaker 1>organ trail.</v>
