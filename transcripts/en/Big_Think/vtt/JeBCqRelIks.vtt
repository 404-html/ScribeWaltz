00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Hi Bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is Sam.</v>

2
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>My question for you is why are we trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live on Mars and recreate earth there</v>

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.840
<v Speaker 1>by making it an atmosphere and soil and</v>
<v Speaker 1>water we can drink and such.</v>

4
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we take those ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation and directed at our own</v>

5
00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:24.970
<v Speaker 1>planet that we clearly need the help</v>
<v Speaker 1>with?</v>

6
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it easier to start fresh on</v>

7
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:29.830
<v Speaker 1>another planet that get people talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about our own?</v>

8
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam,</v>

9
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:35.630
<v Speaker 2>you are my man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam,</v>

10
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:37.760
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking as I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:39.110
<v Speaker 2>I meet a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

12
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:42.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm the CEO of the Planetary Society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We advanced based science and</v>

13
00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:46.910
<v Speaker 2>exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I encourage you to join and as I say</v>

14
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:51.320
<v Speaker 2>about the planetary society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are not crazy.</v>

15
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.610
<v Speaker 2>You meet a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I meet a lot of people who want to go to</v>

16
00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:59.840
<v Speaker 2>Mars and make it like earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just as you're the very idea that you're</v>

17
00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 2>questioning and I think people don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

18
00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 2>just don't grasp the scale of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a planet.</v>

19
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.570
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not</v>

20
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.300
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a wetland that you can reclaim</v>

21
00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:16.700
<v Speaker 2>and build a parking garage on top of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

22
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.010
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Furthermore,</v>

23
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:24.011
<v Speaker 2>this planet where you and I are from is</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly suited to us.</v>

24
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.410
<v Speaker 2>We our ancestors and their ancestors and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so on,</v>

25
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.360
<v Speaker 2>grew up here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tuned to these environments,</v>

26
00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:37.361
<v Speaker 2>to these climates that we have here on</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth and so people want to go to Mars</v>

27
00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:38.630
<v Speaker 2>and the spirit of adventure.</v>

28
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you may infer from my accent,</v>

29
00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:46.061
<v Speaker 2>I'm from the United States and my a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my ancestors came here from Denmark</v>

30
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.750
<v Speaker 2>and Europe and they set up shop and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the colony of Massachusetts and then</v>

31
00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:59.381
<v Speaker 2>they went all the way across North</v>
<v Speaker 2>America to a through Wyoming,</v>

32
00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:03.800
<v Speaker 2>the state of Wyoming and now to the west</v>
<v Speaker 2>coast to to Washington state and</v>

33
00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:05.750
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they did that in this great</v>

34
00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:09.140
<v Speaker 2>tradition of pioneering spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just keep going,</v>

35
00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:10.730
<v Speaker 2>keep expanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep spreading out,</v>

36
00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:12.170
<v Speaker 2>and human kind has done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

37
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:16.940
<v Speaker 2>everybody's from Africa or ancestors are</v>
<v Speaker 2>all from the continent of Africa and we</v>

38
00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:21.290
<v Speaker 2>spread all over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spread to Australia across open ocean.</v>

39
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 2>The polynesians in canoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh right,</v>

40
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.920
<v Speaker 2>we're spreading now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

41
00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:26.480
<v Speaker 2>We're going okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so people think,</v>

42
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.030
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's spread out and go to Mars.</v>

43
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole nother thing to go to Mars.</v>

44
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.750
<v Speaker 2>I tell people this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing.</v>

45
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.240
<v Speaker 2>There's hardly any water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a little bit.</v>

46
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.550
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no air,</v>

47
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 2>there's no air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

48
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.310
<v Speaker 2>We can build a bubble and you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving into cook the Martian rocks and</v>

49
00:02:49.311 --> 00:02:51.140
<v Speaker 2>get the oxygen out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

50
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Speaker 2>It's just not so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just as you asked them,</v>

51
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:57.230
<v Speaker 2>why don't we do that here on earth or do</v>
<v Speaker 2>use that same technology here on earth</v>

52
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 2>and this is part my little mission as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>

53
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not CEO of the planetary society is</v>

54
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 2>reminding everybody that we've got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of the earth in order for us</v>

55
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 2>all to live here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are seven point 3 billion people</v>

56
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 2>as we're recording right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By 2050,</v>

57
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:16.970
<v Speaker 2>there will be nine and maybe even 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion people by the middle of the</v>

58
00:03:16.971 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 2>century and they're all gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Want to eat something and drink</v>

59
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 2>something and water and wash and carry</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

60
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 2>and that's going to take us taking.</v>

61
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 2>It's going to require us to take much</v>
<v Speaker 2>better care of our own planet.</v>

62
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that said,</v>

63
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 2>I like to remind everybody also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although you don't want to go to Mars</v>

64
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 2>and have a permanent settlement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are colony.</v>

65
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.680
<v Speaker 2>You do want to have a base there just as</v>
<v Speaker 2>humankind has a base in the Antarctic</v>

66
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 2>where scientists go and study the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Antarctic,</v>

67
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 2>learn about the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn about our planet,</v>

68
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 2>learn about ice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the are the earth's history and the</v>

69
00:03:57.011 --> 00:04:00.150
<v Speaker 2>climate today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the greenhouse gases and the</v>

70
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.120
<v Speaker 2>effective industrial emissions and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

71
00:04:03.121 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 2>All of these discoveries are made in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Antarctica.</v>

72
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 2>If we were to discover evidence of life</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Mars,</v>

73
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 2>something that was once alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the equivalent of a what a</v>

74
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 2>geologist called stromatolites</v>
<v Speaker 2>fossilized bacteria that have turned to</v>

75
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 2>stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be astounding if we found</v>

76
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:26.851
<v Speaker 2>something still alive there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are these recurring slope linear,</v>

77
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.820
<v Speaker 2>which is geology expression.</v>

78
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 2>For what look like rivulets look like</v>
<v Speaker 2>little rivers.</v>

79
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 2>They may be just rockfalls turned over</v>
<v Speaker 2>gravel.</v>

80
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 2>That as a slightly different color than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the surrounding rock,</v>

81
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.710
<v Speaker 2>but everybody thinks right now that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

82
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:49.711
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's pretty sure by everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about people at the National</v>

83
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Aeronautics and Space Administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>NASA and European Space Agency,</v>

84
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.070
<v Speaker 2>Isa Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese aerospace,</v>

85
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:55.270
<v Speaker 2>exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roscosmos.</v>

86
00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Everybody believes that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>recurring flows of water every Martian</v>

87
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.870
<v Speaker 2>summer when what must be some</v>
<v Speaker 2>subterranean,</v>

88
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:09.871
<v Speaker 2>some under sand ice melts and if we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have liquid water anywhere on</v>

89
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:13.780
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something alive everywhere.</v>

90
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 2>There's liquid water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something alive.</v>

91
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 2>If there's something alive on Mars and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could prove it,</v>

92
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 2>show it to ourselves with our spacecraft</v>
<v Speaker 2>or with human explorers walking around,</v>

93
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.240
<v Speaker 2>I would change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be equivalent to the see the</v>

94
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.690
<v Speaker 2>discoveries that copernicus made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the earth goes around the so all</v>

95
00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 2>the planets go around the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the other way around,</v>

96
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 2>or Galileo.</v>

97
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.890
<v Speaker 2>We're not the only a body out in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cosmos.</v>

98
00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:40.450
<v Speaker 2>We got the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We in fact,</v>

99
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 2>Jupiter has its own moons and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>other discoveries that were so profound</v>

100
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we were to find life on another</v>

101
00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:47.950
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would.</v>

102
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.710
<v Speaker 2>It would change this one and there's one</v>
<v Speaker 2>more element that we at the of this that</v>

103
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 2>we at the planetary society celebrate</v>
<v Speaker 2>these discoveries.</v>

104
00:05:56.831 --> 00:06:01.800
<v Speaker 2>There's of life on Mars or on the moon</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Jupiter that is twice as much sea</v>

105
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 2>waters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth's called Europa.</v>

106
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.510
<v Speaker 2>You can see it with binoculars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

107
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 2>at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we make this discovery of life,</v>

108
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 2>it will not have been done by an</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>

109
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.030
<v Speaker 2>by Galileo or copernicus or Irene Curie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be done by a society who</v>

110
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 2>invested it's intellect and treasure in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this quest.</v>

111
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 2>Let's go see what's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's learn more about ourselves,</v>

112
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 2>our past and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we all want to know whether or not</v>

113
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 2>we're alone in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we look on these two worlds,</v>

114
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:40.850
<v Speaker 2>the earth and Mars and find life on both</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them that would suggest that life is</v>

115
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 2>very common in the cosmos and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

116
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 2>this would affect the way each and every</v>
