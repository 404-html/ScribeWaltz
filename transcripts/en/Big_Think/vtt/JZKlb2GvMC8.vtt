00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.810
<v Speaker 1>The global society in the landscape of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

2
00:00:01.811 --> 00:00:05.380
<v Speaker 1>of our global community is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing rapidly and there are trends</v>

3
00:00:05.381 --> 00:00:09.100
<v Speaker 1>that are developing that I think it</v>
<v Speaker 1>embraced and accelerated could have a</v>

4
00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:13.270
<v Speaker 1>profound positive effect on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trajectory of our global society.</v>

5
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.110
<v Speaker 1>And I think the open source movement and</v>
<v Speaker 1>data sharing I think is a very,</v>

6
00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:20.740
<v Speaker 1>very big part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important for organizations to have</v>

7
00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:22.540
<v Speaker 1>all the pieces of the puzzle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if these are development</v>

8
00:00:22.541 --> 00:00:25.540
<v Speaker 1>organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are crisis response organizations.</v>

9
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have not to date really had a</v>

10
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.730
<v Speaker 1>sufficient effective means to share</v>
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>

11
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.460
<v Speaker 1>And I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean we have technical barriers</v>

12
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.830
<v Speaker 1>to sharing data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have cultural barriers to sharing</v>

13
00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:39.860
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.750
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of organizations around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world including crisis response and</v>

15
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:46.780
<v Speaker 1>development and humanitarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations that are reluctant to</v>

16
00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:51.781
<v Speaker 1>share the real data that makes that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and enables true collaboration.</v>

17
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.450
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a mindset we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get around.</v>

18
00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:59.410
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is there's a difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>between providing data and providing</v>

19
00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:03.820
<v Speaker 1>data in a usable user friendly way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people could actually use for good.</v>

20
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.900
<v Speaker 1>And so there are a lot of efforts around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world to be able to take a</v>

21
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.090
<v Speaker 1>particularly big data and to put that</v>
<v Speaker 1>into bite size bits to put that in</v>

22
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.050
<v Speaker 1>something that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be used by the public used by</v>

23
00:01:17.051 --> 00:01:21.670
<v Speaker 1>citizen scientists used by governments</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create good.</v>

24
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.530
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a strong movement in that</v>

25
00:01:23.531 --> 00:01:25.510
<v Speaker 1>direction but we've got a long way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

26
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I think is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to affect our globe society is a,</v>

27
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.190
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that I think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to propel open source and</v>

28
00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:38.191
<v Speaker 1>transparency and data sharing is I</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that true open collaboration</v>

29
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:43.030
<v Speaker 1>which requires all those things is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a tremendous economic engine.</v>

30
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 1>And I think that those organizations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people and those governments that</v>

31
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.460
<v Speaker 1>deal in corruption deal and secretive</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing,</v>

32
00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:55.570
<v Speaker 1>those organizations that take an</v>
<v Speaker 1>exclusively proprietary mindset are</v>

33
00:01:55.571 --> 00:01:57.850
<v Speaker 1>going to see themselves being left</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind and they're going to have to</v>

34
00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:01.700
<v Speaker 1>adapt and evolve and take on a much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>collaborative and cooperative mountain</v>

35
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.750
<v Speaker 1>mindset to be able to keep up with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic growth.</v>

36
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.100
<v Speaker 1>That true open collaboration will bring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is a really significant</v>

37
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:09.401
<v Speaker 1>trend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

38
00:02:09.401 --> 00:02:12.160
<v Speaker 1>there's many problems that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we face as a global society.</v>

39
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.480
<v Speaker 1>No corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance.</v>

40
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:14.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we've had corruption</v>

41
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>probably since the first transaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.420
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think we're going to be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tackle that head on,</v>

43
00:02:19.421 --> 00:02:23.860
<v Speaker 1>but we can potentially make corruption</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsolete by making it a relevant,</v>

44
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.450
<v Speaker 1>by making it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.520
<v Speaker 1>be an ineffective way to do business.</v>

46
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
