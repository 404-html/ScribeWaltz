<v Speaker 1>My name is Jonathan Keats and I am an</v>
<v Speaker 1>experimental philosophers.</v>

2
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.900
<v Speaker 1>What that means is that I do things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>open a restaurant for plants.</v>

3
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I sell real estate in the extra</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of space.</v>

4
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>I choreograph ballets for honeybees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I build systems by which you can become</v>

5
00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:34.090
<v Speaker 1>married by a law of nature using quantum</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanics.</v>

6
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I even attempt to genetically engineer</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

7
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.640
<v Speaker 1>All of these are rather absurd on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>surface and me not seem especially</v>

8
00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>practical in your everyday life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

9
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I think that there are some basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>lessons that can be extracted from them</v>

10
00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>that at least for me are highly useful</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when I am not pursuing experimental</v>

11
00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:05.650
<v Speaker 1>philosophy even when I am simply trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get by in the world.</v>

12
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Basic ways in which an experimental</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher looks at the world.</v>

13
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>That can be divided perhaps into five</v>
<v Speaker 1>lessons and I'm going to go over these</v>

14
00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:17.704
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

15
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.270
<v Speaker 1>By way of example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at some of the projects that I</v>

16
00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:27.271
<v Speaker 1>have undertaken with the takeaway that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to apply these rules,</v>

17
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.090
<v Speaker 1>either to undertake your own experiment</v>
<v Speaker 1>in philosophy or simply that you can use</v>

18
00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:38.620
<v Speaker 1>these in your creative problem solving</v>
<v Speaker 1>at work or at home.</v>

19
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.660
<v Speaker 1>The lessons can be very briefly</v>
<v Speaker 1>summarized as follows,</v>

20
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.240
<v Speaker 1>ask naive questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>invert perceptions,</v>

21
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Speaker 1>combining compatible ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remix metaphors,</v>

22
00:01:53.891 --> 00:01:58.891
<v Speaker 1>and pursue paradox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By no means are these comprehensive and</v>

23
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.470
<v Speaker 1>the rather Glib.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet I think that if you take these as a</v>

24
00:02:04.751 --> 00:02:09.751
<v Speaker 1>point of departure as I sometimes do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that you get outside of</v>

25
00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:15.880
<v Speaker 1>yourself in terms of your routines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your education,</v>

26
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.210
<v Speaker 1>and your common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you start to look at the world in</v>

27
00:02:19.211 --> 00:02:24.130
<v Speaker 1>different ways that may lead you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that you never knew that you had.</v>

28
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>And so I would like to invite you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>join me in this workshop in experimental</v>

29
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:35.320
<v Speaker 1>philosophy here on Big Pink Mentor.</v>
