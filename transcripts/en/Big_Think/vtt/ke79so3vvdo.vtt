00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.950
<v Speaker 2>I want to tell you one story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the story came from the early 19</v>

3
00:00:07.951 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 2>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman named Wanda,</v>

4
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Ruth Lunsford,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the scientist in New York City</v>

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.300
<v Speaker 2>and she published one paper which turned</v>
<v Speaker 2>out to be our one paper in science,</v>

6
00:00:16.301 --> 00:00:19.950
<v Speaker 2>so we just actually push data science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What she did was she took an old rat in</v>

7
00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 2>a young rat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She put him to sleep and she tied their</v>

8
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:25.530
<v Speaker 2>skin together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So after about a day or so,</v>

9
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 2>their blood supplies joined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

10
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 2>several weeks later she looked in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>old rat.</v>

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 2>There were new neurons growing in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

12
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.890
<v Speaker 2>the heartbeat stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the muscles were bigger.</v>

13
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 2>The gray hair term brown again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she claimed she reversed aging.</v>

14
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.340
<v Speaker 2>People call her dracula or Frankenstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of crazy names.</v>

15
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier this year,</v>

16
00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 2>three separate laboratories at Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stanford University of California,</v>

17
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:53.040
<v Speaker 2>San Francisco repeated the experiment</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it worked,</v>

18
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.640
<v Speaker 2>and what they showed is at age 25,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you and I are stem cells go to sleep</v>

19
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:04.461
<v Speaker 2>and get turned off and proteins from</v>
<v Speaker 2>young mice in this case or young humans</v>

20
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.020
<v Speaker 2>can turn them back on again.</v>

21
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 2>And when these stem cells get turned</v>
<v Speaker 2>back on,</v>

22
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.820
<v Speaker 2>new neurons can be growed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>repair happens much quicker and tissue</v>

23
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 2>and tissue we all see read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our child breaks his leg.</v>

24
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:18.530
<v Speaker 2>He or she are back walking again a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of weeks.</v>

25
00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your grandmother breaks her leg and it</v>

26
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:23.790
<v Speaker 2>hits her quality life the rest of her</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

27
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 2>So there are clinical trials now using</v>
<v Speaker 2>proteins that were founding young</v>

28
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 2>individuals to try to stimulate bone</v>
<v Speaker 2>repair in the elderly who have</v>

29
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 2>fractures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so just like a diabetic requires a</v>

30
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 2>shot of insulin so that they can manage</v>
<v Speaker 2>their sugar going forward.</v>

31
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 2>If you break your leg in the elderly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we may just give you a shot of these</v>

32
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 2>proteins to turn back on your stem cells</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can repair quicker.</v>

33
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 2>We're trying it in cancer because cancer</v>
<v Speaker 2>in kids is about 90 percent curable.</v>

34
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Once you turn 25,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that same cancer turns incurable.</v>

35
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 2>So maybe if I can give it to the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's younger.</v>

36
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 2>I can have a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We as a science community can have a</v>

37
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:04.470
<v Speaker 2>bigger impact on cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I leave you with that bit of hope,</v>

38
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 2>that aging is something that may be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be reversed and not so we can live</v>

39
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 2>till I'm 150,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so that we can all live until our</v>

40
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:16.911
<v Speaker 2>ninth or 10th decade without there being</v>
<v Speaker 2>a decrease in quality in those last</v>

41
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that'd be the goal quality years</v>

42
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 2>till the end.</v>
