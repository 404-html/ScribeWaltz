1
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.870
<v Speaker 1>We have a band called racket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

2
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.793
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.960
<v Speaker 2>it's a rock and roll band and it was set</v>
<v Speaker 2>up by myself and a fellow called Nigel</v>

4
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Smith who's a scholar of English</v>
<v Speaker 2>literature in particular a marvel and</v>

5
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Milton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does some work and him used to teach</v>

6
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 2>at Oxford.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met him in Oxford actually when I was</v>

7
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:37.341
<v Speaker 2>a professor poetry at Oxford and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the head of the English department at</v>

8
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:41.440
<v Speaker 2>Oxford United Teachers at Princeton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He's,</v>

9
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.020
<v Speaker 2>he's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very</v>

10
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 2>serious scholar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but behind it all he's a rocker.</v>

11
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he and I got together and we started.</v>

12
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 2>I have always been interested in trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to write songs I just</v>

13
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.230
<v Speaker 2>would love to be able to do it was quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>a difficult thing to do also.</v>

14
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.280
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got together and we set up with a</v>

15
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 2>band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been a couple of versions of it,</v>

16
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:14.121
<v Speaker 2>but the present version of a great</v>
<v Speaker 2>guitarist and lead singer called Matthew</v>

17
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 2>as a music scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

18
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.500
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

19
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.373
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.990
<v Speaker 2>Steven Alan who's an entertainment</v>
<v Speaker 2>lawyer,</v>

21
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Speaker 2>but a trained musician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the Berkeley College of music.</v>

22
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.850
<v Speaker 2>And then our drummer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bobby Lewis as a also studied music at,</v>

23
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the College of New Jersey,</v>

24
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Trenton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're all,</v>

25
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.070
<v Speaker 2>they're all quite wonderful musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this bit's rock'n'roll.</v>

26
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 2>So rock and roll with the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hope you know,</v>

27
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.100
<v Speaker 2>Demi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sammy,</v>

28
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.370
<v Speaker 2>Tammy semi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

29
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.480
<v Speaker 2>Merrick's we're hoping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're hoping that's the idea.</v>

30
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.400
<v Speaker 2>So that combination and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.050
<v Speaker 2>we keep plugging away at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a</v>

32
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.370
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do it for fun to a large extent,</v>

33
00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:12.371
<v Speaker 2>but we also were somewhat areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in the sense that we're expected who</v>

34
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.940
<v Speaker 2>playing Madison Square Garden any day</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon though.</v>

35
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Mind you if there's anyone from Madison</v>
<v Speaker 2>Square Garden listening,</v>

36
00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:21.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should think about is um,</v>

37
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.810
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

38
00:02:22.811 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 2>we have to be realistic about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

39
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.930
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose that a fixed but 56 year old</v>

40
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 2>like myself shouldn't be cherishing even</v>
<v Speaker 2>the remotest notion of that.</v>

41
00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:38.860
<v Speaker 2>But then I think Mick Jagger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mick Jagger's in slightly better shape</v>

42
00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:41.920
<v Speaker 2>than I am as A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

43
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm back to the treadmill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write the lyrics.</v>

44
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.030
<v Speaker 2>That's my main role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write the lyrics and I play the odd</v>

45
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.500
<v Speaker 2>some sometimes ms dot calculated chord</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a guitar,</v>

46
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do so with Breo or certainly the</v>

47
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:04.411
<v Speaker 2>attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the attempt a of a Breo.</v>

48
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.660
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>

49
00:03:06.661 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 2>it's so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so much fun.</v>

50
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 2>And the band actually is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

51
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the standard one side.</v>

52
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.320
<v Speaker 2>We're praising myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd said they're quite brilliant</v>

53
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.750
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
