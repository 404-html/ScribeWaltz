1
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I frankly do feel that the,</v>

2
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Europeans have a much more mature</v>

3
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.993
<v Speaker 1>overall</v>

4
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 2>outlook on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 2>on this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.840
<v Speaker 2>most people that I know anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were brought up in Europe,</v>

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were brought up with a little bit of</v>

8
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 2>water blended with wine when they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their teens finally with a little bit</v>

9
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 2>of wine at the dinner table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

10
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 2>when they were in their late teens and</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time they hit 18,</v>

11
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 2>it's not a big deal anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really in countries that,</v>

12
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't have as mature and outlook on</v>

13
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 2>the issue that tend to have problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>with binge drinking,</v>

14
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

15
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.180
<v Speaker 2>there can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see good arguments on either side,</v>

16
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was responsible.</v>

17
00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went through this weird period where I</v>

18
00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 2>was 18 and I was legal and then I became</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal when they changed the,</v>

19
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they changed it to 21.</v>

20
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 2>And then I went back to being legal</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

21
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

22
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 2>two years later I was in this weird kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a limbo thing.</v>

23
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.051
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

24
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I think that I was responsible when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was younger,</v>

25
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

26
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 2>you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

27
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

28
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to bring up to sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 2>all the classic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

30
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

31
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 2>if you can go and fight in a war and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't have a beer,</v>

32
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 2>all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a complicated issue.</v>

33
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.620
<v Speaker 2>But I just do think that rather than</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at it from a historical point of</v>

34
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 2>view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is often the case that</v>

35
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 2>people take a calmer longview</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizing that,</v>

36
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the enjoyment of alcoholic</v>

37
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:46.120
<v Speaker 2>beverages is a part of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

38
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 2>human humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

39
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.270
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of what we're,</v>

40
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.190
<v Speaker 2>we're all about buying large as human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

41
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:53.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

42
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people believe that we went from a</v>

43
00:01:55.871 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 2>hunter gatherer existence to a settled</v>
<v Speaker 2>agricultural existence in order to have</v>

44
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 2>enough grain to make beer.</v>

45
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is central to the human experience</v>

46
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.820
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a,</v>

47
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

48
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 2>and it's healthy for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in moderation.</v>

49
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.840
<v Speaker 2>And it's better for you than not having</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

50
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.160
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

51
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 2>if you really want to bring people up</v>
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>

52
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teach them how to eat properly and teach</v>

53
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:21.410
<v Speaker 2>them how to drink properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

54
00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you wanna,</v>

55
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 2>if you want to ban something that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to,</v>

56
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

57
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 2>caused a lot of problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>

58
00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's band butter,</v>

59
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or let's ban.</v>

60
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:33.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to look at the overall</v>

61
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:35.390
<v Speaker 2>cost of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but better</v>

62
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.010
<v Speaker 1>I teach people how to cook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to eat and how to live well.</v>

63
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are alcoholics and you weren't</v>

64
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.203
<v Speaker 1>quite sure,</v>

65
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean unfortunately,</v>

66
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean alcoholism is a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a problem,</v>

67
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as overeating as a disease.</v>

68
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean beer essentially is food and</v>

69
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 2>people are going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

70
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.960
<v Speaker 2>are going to abuse all sorts of foods in</v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways and whether this involves</v>

71
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:10.864
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 2>eating this and that and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and growing to be,</v>

73
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 400 lbs and,</v>

74
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 2>and not being functional or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

75
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an alcohol problem.</v>

76
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 2>All of these things are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems across the board and society.</v>

77
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.880
<v Speaker 2>I think you can take a more mature</v>
<v Speaker 2>outlook on it as a society and not look</v>

78
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 2>at it as whether,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

79
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:34.421
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

80
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's eating or it's a alcohol.</v>

81
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Is it a moral problem or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it really teaching people how to</v>

82
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:47.671
<v Speaker 2>handle themselves in a world that my</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands everything to you on a platter and</v>

83
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

84
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 2>here it is for you to consume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>

85
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:52.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

86
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Europeans have a better outlook on</v>

87
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:56.010
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are by no means perfect.</v>

88
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

89
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say that I can answer a question</v>

90
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

91
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 2>so quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm reminded of a,</v>

92
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:09.420
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

93
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Francois Mitterrand last meal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think lasted about two days,</v>

94
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and had sort of every little,</v>

95
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>order lawns and,</v>

96
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.100
<v Speaker 2>and whatever else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of his friends around him.</v>

97
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

98
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:23.120
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

99
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the greatest,</v>

100
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the greatest risks that you can be</v>

101
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:26.171
<v Speaker 2>broad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

102
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:28.400
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had beers as old as 18,</v>

103
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 2>69,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are unbelievable.</v>

104
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.831
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

105
00:04:31.831 --> 00:04:35.010
<v Speaker 2>I would be gathering up things for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for years,</v>

106
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.990
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

107
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 2>for such an occasion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

108
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like me to,</v>

109
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.540
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would make it that meal last for like</v>

110
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 2>two or three days and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

111
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:47.270
<v Speaker 2>then that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a question I get a,</v>

112
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 2>I can answer quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can,</v>

113
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 2>I can assure you that it would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>awfully good.</v>
