00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 2>Britain had a real problem in the 1990s</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it basically allowed a number of</v>

3
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 2>radical clerics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for very key crap clerics to</v>

4
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 2>operate within the country.</v>

<v Speaker 2>to radicalize youngsters,</v>

9
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 2>to travel up and down the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>address thousands of followers and some</v>

10
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 2>of those followers then join up with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

<v Speaker 2>cause real problems to the British</v>

13
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 2>authorities in the period afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And certainly by either expelling some</v>

14
00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:54.201
<v Speaker 2>of them or imprisoning other others of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them that that problem has been reduced.</v>

15

<v Speaker 2>The radicals now being driven much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>underground in the United Kingdom at</v>

16
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.620
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which poses all sorts of other concerns,</v>

17
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:06.621
<v Speaker 2>but at least there isn't this a radical</v>
<v Speaker 2>message being put out in the open</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

24
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 2>and you're starting really to see a push</v>
<v Speaker 2>back against the radicals amongst,</v>

25
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>2005 alcaide or attack on the London</v>

<v Speaker 2>little bit of sympathy with what some of</v>

44
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 2>our Kyler was doing around the world.</v>

<v Speaker 2>some of them became a even more</v>

52
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.100
<v Speaker 2>fervently radicalized by that event,</v>
