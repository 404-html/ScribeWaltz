1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.821
<v Speaker 1>Trolling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:00.821 --> 00:00:05.821
<v Speaker 1>certainly the topic of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were having this conversation in</v>

3
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:09.870
<v Speaker 1>1995 for one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the screen would be about one 16th.</v>

4
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>The size and the video quality would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>much poorer,</v>

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>but it would be a very standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>configuration.</v>

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.660
<v Speaker 1>The story would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

7
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>there's now an internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can say anything.</v>

8
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it gets a little out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>control and maybe the government will</v>

9
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:29.001
<v Speaker 1>come in and try to regulate in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically the government is</v>

10
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 1>trying to stop illegal or really extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>things from happening and otherwise it's</v>

11
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.760
<v Speaker 1>just a free for all out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm away.</v>

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 1>We go fast forward 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

13
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:45.171
<v Speaker 1>20 years and we see an environment now</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which many many people want to</v>

14
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>participate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe have used.</v>

15
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>They want to share and if you stick your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head up out of the gopher hole and it</v>

16
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>happened to say something in temperate</v>
<v Speaker 1>or wrong or that others may disapprove</v>

17
00:00:58.171 --> 00:00:59.940
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might not just say,</v>

18
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>

19
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about this.</v>

20
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may decide to try to docs.</v>

21
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>You find out where you live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the names of the rest of your family to</v>

22
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>threaten you with the goal of making you</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel insecure.</v>

23
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>They might try to swat you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the police that there's something</v>

24
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>terrible going on in your house and</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you know it,</v>

25
00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:22.320
<v Speaker 1>there's blue and red lights outside your</v>
<v Speaker 1>window and people ready to kick in the</v>

26
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a strange state of affairs and</v>

27
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>it's one I think with multiple causes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that actually is susceptible to</v>

28
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>pretty sustained study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of which hasn't happened yet in the</v>

29
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.903
<v Speaker 1>next few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it will.</v>

30
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>That says what makes people want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>react that way.</v>

31
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.450
<v Speaker 1>My best cut on it at the most abstract</v>
<v Speaker 1>level is that when we are online,</v>

32
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>we may be undertaking very different</v>
<v Speaker 1>activities and the people that we're</v>

33
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:51.384
<v Speaker 1>talking to.</v>

34
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>One model for being online is I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertaining myself.</v>

35
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am in some form or another plane</v>

36
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that's the case,</v>

37
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>playing the game means picking aside and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very different model from.</v>

38
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm online because I really believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>earnestly and something and I want to</v>

39
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.630
<v Speaker 1>convince you of why I'm right or have</v>
<v Speaker 1>you maybe convince me or find people who</v>

40
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>are of like mind and we can talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategizing about the thing that we</v>

41
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>really care about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are totally different activities</v>

42
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:26.610
<v Speaker 1>and when you try to mix the two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like saying if there's going</v>

43
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:31.611
<v Speaker 1>to be a discussion between Seattle</v>
<v Speaker 1>seahawks fans and New England patriots</v>

44
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>fans ahead of a superbowl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't we just settle this with a</v>

45
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>discussion like can't we just earnestly</v>
<v Speaker 1>era our differences and come to some</v>

46
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:43.230
<v Speaker 1>compromise that the patriots should win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only by five points.</v>

47
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Like that's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of the conversation is sort</v>

48
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:52.641
<v Speaker 1>of just the chest thumping that comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the play of being a fan of a team</v>

49
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:55.280
<v Speaker 1>and trash talking to the other team and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

50
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:56.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you play the game.</v>

51
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.150
<v Speaker 1>I think that for a lot of trolling</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a sense that it's just not</v>

52
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:06.390
<v Speaker 1>impersonal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just out to have some fun.</v>

53
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Others have referred to this as four</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chan culture and uh,</v>

54
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>of course named after the site four Chan</v>
<v Speaker 1>for which this is the largely the</v>

55
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 1>culture figuring out I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to have people avoid category errors</v>

56
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.900
<v Speaker 1>might be a good way to relieve a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit the initial conditions that give</v>

57
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>rise to a situation that you fast</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward and somehow death or rape</v>

58
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>threats are being made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Personal information is getting</v>

59
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:39.931
<v Speaker 1>scattered everywhere and the parties</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind it still or just like think it's</v>

60
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 1>no big deal.</v>

61
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Like they just go to sleep at night and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow they'll find a new cause to get</v>

62
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 1>involved in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine we will also see some of these</v>

63
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>intermediary platforms that are commonly</v>
<v Speaker 1>used for many purposes like twitter.</v>

64
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.590
<v Speaker 1>They're going to start taking a heavier</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand at intervening when discussions get</v>

65
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 1>rough and it might be as simple as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.240
<v Speaker 1>being more willing to delete accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which let's be clear that's going to</v>

67
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>mean that others will be more willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to import tune twitter to delete</v>

68
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 1>accounts as part of the battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 1>between people who are arguing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something over the longer term.</v>

70
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.090
<v Speaker 1>I think we may see coming into view</v>
<v Speaker 1>something has been promised for awhile</v>

71
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be careful what you ask for.</v>

72
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say some form of singular or</v>

73
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:30.280
<v Speaker 1>multi-platform reputation systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think how different ones,</v>

74
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:32.590
<v Speaker 1>twitter or facebook experience might be.</v>

75
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.010
<v Speaker 1>If the feed is populated on the basis of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are known to participate with</v>

76
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 1>a bare minimum of civility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's define it easily as don't engage</v>

77
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 1>in serious imminent death threats and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>

78
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.630
<v Speaker 1>you might not have your account deleted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you will find that the way in which</v>

79
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:57.631
<v Speaker 1>you tweet will not have the same reach</v>
<v Speaker 1>as people who either through the twitter</v>

80
00:04:57.821 --> 00:05:02.821
<v Speaker 1>platform or through behavior on other</v>
<v Speaker 1>platforms that has been deemed a civil</v>

81
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:08.311
<v Speaker 1>and productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those will start to get reach to and I.</v>

82
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I will say that once people kind of know</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basis on which they're being graded</v>

83
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.990
<v Speaker 1>can have a really instant effect on</v>
<v Speaker 1>their behavior.</v>

84
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Some of us may remember the moment that</v>
<v Speaker 1>uber mistakenly made it easy for</v>

85
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:28.471
<v Speaker 1>somebody to find his or her own rating</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a passenger by drivers on Uber,</v>

86
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 1>drivers rate passengers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just the other way around,</v>

87
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 1>and people are much more self conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>now maybe about how they'll behave in an</v>

88
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.270
<v Speaker 1>uber if they want to retain a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>rating so that they will be more likely</v>

89
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 1>to be picked up when they need a cab or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ride in the future.</v>

90
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Those reputation systems both hold</v>
<v Speaker 1>promise as a way of having trolling the,</v>

91
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>if not punished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not rewarded,</v>

92
00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>good behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means is the eyes of the</v>

93
00:05:57.771 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 1>people rating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a rising you up in the scales and</v>

94
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>giving you more reach a and of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>also carries with it a whole host of new</v>

95
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>and difficult questions about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

96
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:12.090
<v Speaker 1>who runs this rating system?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the people writing me or</v>

97
00:06:12.091 --> 00:06:17.091
<v Speaker 1>raping me by criteria that are unfair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be based on the color of my</v>

98
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:22.781
<v Speaker 1>skin or my ethnicity or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that we could find rating systems</v>

99
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:27.230
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're just not exactly there yet.</v>

100
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have to see what are the solutions</v>

101
00:06:30.451 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 1>that will come about problems like</v>
<v Speaker 1>trolling and one of the problems that</v>

102
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 1>those solutions will raise.</v>
