1
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.280
<v Speaker 1>The question isn't about whether dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter exists or not.</v>

2
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>What's going on is when we measure</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity in the universe that the</v>

3
00:00:16.751 --> 00:00:19.810
<v Speaker 1>collective gravity of the stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planets,</v>

4
00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:21.250
<v Speaker 1>the moons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gas clouds,</v>

5
00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:25.420
<v Speaker 1>the black holes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole galaxies.</v>

6
00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:30.421
<v Speaker 1>When we do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>85% has no known origin.</v>

7
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a matter of whether dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter exists or not.</v>

8
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a measurement period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

9
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.070
<v Speaker 1>dark matter is not even what we should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be calling it cause that implies that</v>

10
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:50.620
<v Speaker 1>it's matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It implies we know something about it</v>

11
00:00:50.621 --> 00:00:55.621
<v Speaker 1>that we actually don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a more precise labeling for it would</v>

12
00:00:57.251 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>be dark gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if I call the dark gravity,</v>

13
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.610
<v Speaker 1>are you going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does dark gravity really exists?</v>

14
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

15
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.980
<v Speaker 1>it's 85% of the gravity has no known</v>
<v Speaker 1>origin.</v>

16
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.390
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's figure out what's causing it.</v>

17
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 1>The fact that the word matter got into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that word is forcing people to,</v>

18
00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:20.230
<v Speaker 1>I have another idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's not matter.</v>

19
00:01:20.231 --> 00:01:25.231
<v Speaker 1>It could be something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're overreacting to a label that</v>

20
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>overstates are actual insights or</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge into what it is we're</v>

21
00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:36.010
<v Speaker 1>describing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I just joke,</v>

22
00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:39.640
<v Speaker 1>we should just call it fred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fred or Wilma,</v>

23
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>something where there is no reference to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we think it is because in fact we</v>

24
00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:46.744
<v Speaker 1>have no idea.</v>

25
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.620
<v Speaker 1>So here's how you actually measure this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

26
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a galaxy,</v>

27
00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:58.270
<v Speaker 1>which was the smallest aggregation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter where dark matter manifests.</v>

28
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>So you look how fast it's rotating and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know from laws of gravity first laid</v>

29
00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:06.590
<v Speaker 1>down by Johann is Kepler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then modify,</v>

30
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>then enhanced and given further detail</v>
<v Speaker 1>in deeper understanding by Isaac Newton.</v>

31
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.110
<v Speaker 1>You write down these equations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

32
00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how fast it's rotating.</v>

33
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Invoke that rotation rate in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>equation and out the other side says how</v>

34
00:02:21.881 --> 00:02:24.880
<v Speaker 1>much gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much mass should be they're</v>

35
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.580
<v Speaker 1>attracting you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more mass that's there,</v>

36
00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:31.630
<v Speaker 1>the faster we expect you to be orbiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of makes sense.</v>

37
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 1>So when you do this calculation on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>galactic scale,</v>

38
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>we get vastly more mass attracting you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we actually can detect,</v>

39
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm adding up the stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gas clouds,</v>

40
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.760
<v Speaker 1>moons planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black holes,</v>

41
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.310
<v Speaker 1>add it all up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fraction of what we know is</v>

42
00:02:55.151 --> 00:03:00.151
<v Speaker 1>attracting you in this orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we cannot detect the rest and so we</v>

43
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:07.201
<v Speaker 1>handed this title dark matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understandably I suppose,</v>

44
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>but it implies that we know that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter but we don't,</v>

45
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>we know we can't detect it in any known</v>
<v Speaker 1>way</v>

46
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.150
<v Speaker 1>and we know it has gravity so it really</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be called dark gravity.</v>

47
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.030
<v Speaker 1>I think the over under on what dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter might be today.</v>

48
00:03:29.031 --> 00:03:34.031
<v Speaker 1>I think we're all kind of leaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards a family of particles,</v>

49
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>subatomic particles that have hardly any</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to interact with the particles</v>

50
00:03:44.811 --> 00:03:49.700
<v Speaker 1>we have come to know and love quote</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary matter and that would make it</v>

51
00:03:49.701 --> 00:03:52.790
<v Speaker 1>matter dark matter as we've all been</v>
<v Speaker 1>describing it</v>

52
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.900
<v Speaker 1>and it's not a weird thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could have a particle that doesn't</v>

53
00:03:56.901 --> 00:04:01.370
<v Speaker 1>interact with our particles within our</v>
<v Speaker 1>own family of particles.</v>

54
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Speaker 1>There are examples where the interaction</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very weak or nonexistence you</v>

55
00:04:07.701 --> 00:04:11.120
<v Speaker 1>might've heard of neutrinos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a ghost like particle that</v>

56
00:04:11.121 --> 00:04:16.121
<v Speaker 1>permeates the universe and hardly</v>
<v Speaker 1>interacts with familiar matter at all.</v>

57
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Yet it is part of our family of</v>
<v Speaker 1>particles that we know exist and that we</v>

58
00:04:21.141 --> 00:04:24.350
<v Speaker 1>can detect and interact with.</v>

59
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.700
<v Speaker 1>So if that can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can have an elusive particle</v>

60
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.460
<v Speaker 1>that's part of our own familiar family</v>
<v Speaker 1>of particles,</v>

61
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not much of a stretch to think of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole other category of particles were.</v>

62
00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:40.340
<v Speaker 1>None of them give a rat's ass about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of us and they just pass right</v>

63
00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:42.050
<v Speaker 1>through us as though we're not even</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

64
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Now here's what's interesting about dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

65
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 1>We know it doesn't interact with us</v>
<v Speaker 1>except the gravitational.</v>

66
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:53.060
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I mean by interact?</v>

67
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Does it bind and make atoms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules and solid objects?</v>

68
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does not interact with us in any</v>

69
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.720
<v Speaker 1>important known way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also doesn't interact with</v>

70
00:05:05.721 --> 00:05:08.720
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's interesting.</v>

71
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 1>So if it interacted with itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could imagine finding dark matter</v>

72
00:05:15.441 --> 00:05:17.930
<v Speaker 1>planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark matter galaxies.</v>

73
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Because to interact with yourself is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what allows you to accumulate and have a</v>

74
00:05:23.091 --> 00:05:26.360
<v Speaker 1>concentration of matter in one place</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus another.</v>

75
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.390
<v Speaker 1>These are the atomic bonds and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecular bonds that creates solid</v>

76
00:05:32.391 --> 00:05:37.391
<v Speaker 1>objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if particles do not interact with</v>

77
00:05:38.481 --> 00:05:39.890
<v Speaker 1>one another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just pass through.</v>

78
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.100
<v Speaker 1>You just have this zone of mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really doing anything interesting.</v>

79
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.660
<v Speaker 1>So dark matter not only doesn't interact</v>
<v Speaker 1>with us,</v>

80
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't interact with itself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why when we find dark matter</v>

81
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.250
<v Speaker 1>across the universe is very diffusely</v>
<v Speaker 1>spread out.</v>

82
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like over here,</v>

83
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 1>it's not in this one spot and look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this concentration.</v>

84
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not how that works.</v>

85
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>An example of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what is a rock?</v>

86
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 1>It's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a collection of atoms and molecules</v>

87
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.310
<v Speaker 1>that are stuck together by</v>
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetic forces.</v>

88
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>We don't think of them that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just think of them as rocks,</v>

89
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.700
<v Speaker 1>but they are held together by forces on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the atomic and molecular scale and they</v>

90
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 1>bind together and then we get what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>call the solid object called a rock.</v>

91
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>If those forces did not work on you as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particle,</v>

92
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 1>you have no occasion to bind with any</v>
<v Speaker 1>other particle.</v>

93
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.570
<v Speaker 1>You have no occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no ambitions of ever becoming a</v>

94
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:58.571
<v Speaker 1>solid object</v>
<v Speaker 1>to different kind of world.</v>

95
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.700
<v Speaker 1>That would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would not expect that world to have</v>

96
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:09.701
<v Speaker 1>life as we know it because life requires</v>
<v Speaker 1>and assembly of molecules to turn it</v>

97
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 1>into some separate entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinct from everything else.</v>

98
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.810
<v Speaker 1>That then has fascinating chemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>properties that we call life.</v>
