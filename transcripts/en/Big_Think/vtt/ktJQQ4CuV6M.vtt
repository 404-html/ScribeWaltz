1
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 1>I committed myself in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my book Keynes,</v>

2
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:16.530
<v Speaker 1>the return of the master to the view</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the blame lies chiefly with the</v>

3
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:19.470
<v Speaker 1>economists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I because of my,</v>

4
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conviction that ideas matter and that</v>

5
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not just puppets of ideas,</v>

6
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.050
<v Speaker 1>but what's what goes on in their heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they think about the world is</v>

7
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:35.960
<v Speaker 1>really provided by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 1>the thinkers and in this case the</v>
<v Speaker 1>economist.</v>

9
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>And that shapes their actions to an</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary degree.</v>

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not enough to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

11
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.130
<v Speaker 1>bankers were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

12
00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>were immensely greedy and that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed lots of frauds.</v>

13
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's not that they were set</v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

14
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:58.101
<v Speaker 1>That sort of particular proclivity in</v>
<v Speaker 1>human nature was set free to do its best</v>

15
00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>and its worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well who set it free?</v>

16
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously regulators and</v>
<v Speaker 1>governments,</v>

17
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>but politicians and regulators or</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumers of ideas,</v>

18
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 1>they never have any ideas of their own.</v>

19
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it take too much,</v>

20
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 1>too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hard work to develop ideas or you</v>

21
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 1>get them on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get them off menus and you pick the</v>

22
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>ones that suit you and say they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

23
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 1>so there was this chain and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the important thing.</v>

24
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.520
<v Speaker 1>If you like financial intermediation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial services was set free to go</v>

25
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>beyond their rightful place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A place by which they had been</v>

26
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:39.270
<v Speaker 1>restrained in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think in the periods when they</v>

27
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:42.020
<v Speaker 1>were restrained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economies were much more stable and</v>

28
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

29
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.290
<v Speaker 1>they became later on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's my basic answer.</v>

30
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 1>It's the ideas that are important.</v>

31
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>By the time you're in a hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the crisis remember came on very,</v>

32
00:01:56.581 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 1>very suddenly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say it had been germinating</v>

33
00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>for the previous year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course people were alert to things</v>

34
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>even in 2007 but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then hit with a thunder clap.</v>

35
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.030
<v Speaker 1>And within a month it was as though the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole of the western banking system was</v>

36
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:15.360
<v Speaker 1>about to be wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when they came in very,</v>

37
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:17.600
<v Speaker 1>very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Governments and,</v>

38
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.141
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

39
00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:18.601
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

40
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>and central banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after that they have to say,</v>

41
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:24.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're in this whole,</v>

42
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.960
<v Speaker 1>how do we sort of nudge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nudge economies out of it?</v>

43
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Because economies with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by this time,</v>

44
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.940
<v Speaker 1>our life support system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the banks are on life support system and</v>

45
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>the real economy was starting to be on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>life support system.</v>

46
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 1>So Keynes I think would have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have actually approved of most of</v>

47
00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:39.390
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

48
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 1>I think some things he would have done</v>
<v Speaker 1>in different way.</v>

49
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 1>But do they go back to the old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old question?</v>

50
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

51
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.730
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost no use asking what would he</v>

52
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:51.540
<v Speaker 1>have done in detail because things have</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>

53
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>But it's the spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

55
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Speaker 1>his analysis and the spirit in which he</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have tackled these problems that</v>

56
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>are important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think he would have been on the</v>

57
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:04.260
<v Speaker 1>side of expanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're sliding down a rather than a</v>

59
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>buttoning up your coats and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

60
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and saying,</v>

61
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:12.731
<v Speaker 1>we must,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must,</v>

62
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>we must tighten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tighten our belts.</v>

63
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think he would have thought that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have brought to us,</v>

64
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.790
<v Speaker 1>bring us even lower than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

65
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>than we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than we've gone</v>

66
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.520
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
