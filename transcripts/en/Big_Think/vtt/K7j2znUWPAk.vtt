1
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Don't use that example and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly it's a challenge to complete the</v>

2
00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:21.520
<v Speaker 1>whole a bicycle wheel around that happen</v>

3
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>in the upper west side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the,</v>

4
00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:28.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially to the north,</v>

5
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>you necessarily to work a lot to</v>
<v Speaker 1>complete the uh,</v>

6
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>pedestrian and bicycle walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We buy the water side.</v>

7
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.240
<v Speaker 1>There are many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many streets were protected bicycle way</v>

8
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>needed because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some even seems to be,</v>

9
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean some were painted initially and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they seem to be getting rid of them</v>

10
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>like intense three days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>it's like getting a race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that was painted so clearly.</v>

12
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Clearly there is a space in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the real issue is the parking</v>

13
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 1>space for cars in the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

14
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>the United States constitution has as</v>
<v Speaker 1>many rights people in the United States</v>

15
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 1>have a right to live without fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without crime.</v>

16
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.300
<v Speaker 1>They have a right to free education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a right to,</v>

17
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.870
<v Speaker 1>to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have many rights,</v>

18
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>but they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parking is not a constitutional right,</v>

19
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:30.723
<v Speaker 1>eh?</v>

20
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be questioned more</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

21
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>whether it's how to use this space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has now been taken by cars,</v>

22
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:43.941
<v Speaker 1>parking by the curb side is that small</v>
<v Speaker 1>minority of people who are taking up</v>

23
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:49.251
<v Speaker 1>these extremely valuable space in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>streets of New York to park and I think</v>

24
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>in many streets do you call the red</v>
<v Speaker 1>guard rail parking and make some much</v>

25
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>bigger side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just make some fantastic protected</v>

26
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>bicycle ways in all directions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some regulations I think also have to be</v>

27
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:07.730
<v Speaker 1>enacted so that people can walk in with</v>
<v Speaker 1>bicycles into,</v>

28
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.660
<v Speaker 1>into the elevators and into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hallways.</v>

29
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

30
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>if people can go with dogs or we shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a,</v>

31
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>into a hallway or in a little later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not go with a bicycle,</v>

32
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>but this New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Manhattan in particular is the</v>

33
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:29.631
<v Speaker 1>perfect city to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for everybody to move by bicycle and</v>

34
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:32.690
<v Speaker 1>even in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the winter is possible in most of the</v>

35
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:33.381
<v Speaker 1>winter with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:34.250
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.873
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.550
<v Speaker 1>coats</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go by bicycle level</v>

39
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.150
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
