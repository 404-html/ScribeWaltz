00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.680
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt that the Internet is</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating what is called an intelligent</v>

2
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the skin of the planet earth is</v>

3
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:12.240
<v Speaker 1>becoming a network by which intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures communicate with each other,</v>

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>but that's just the first step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people think that the next step in</v>

5
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>the coming decades is not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the internet.</v>

6
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:23.700
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be brain net because we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the point now where we can actually</v>

7
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>connect computers to the living mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

8
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I was just at Berkeley a few weeks ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I had a demonstration of this.</v>

9
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>We can actually create videos of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>

10
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 1>These videos are not perfectly accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I saw a demonstration a at a</v>

11
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>laboratory at Berkeley where you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually see in a video screen what</v>

12
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>people are thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with electrodes perhaps or eeg</v>

13
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>sensors in a helmet connected to our</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

14
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>perhaps one day we'll be able to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain to brain communication and that</v>

15
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>gives us the possibility of brain net.</v>

16
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the leading neurologists doing</v>

17
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>these experiments have sear released to</v>
<v Speaker 1>propose a braid net whereby you would</v>

18
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:10.641
<v Speaker 1>exchange not just information like</v>
<v Speaker 1>typing but also emotions,</v>

19
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.250
<v Speaker 1>feelings because these are also part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fabric of our thoughts and then what</v>

20
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>comes beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well of course,</v>

21
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>beyond that is science fiction and</v>
<v Speaker 1>science fiction gives us all sorts of</v>

22
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:28.290
<v Speaker 1>horror stories of things like skynet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe one day the Internet will become</v>

23
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>sentient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe one day the Internet will think</v>

24
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:36.240
<v Speaker 1>that humans are in the way and perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet will take over just like in</v>

25
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>the terminator series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is simply a way in which</v>

27
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 1>minds can communicate with other minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see no self awareness in the</v>

28
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now some people say,</v>

29
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about some kind of collective</v>

30
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that arises by an emergent</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon?</v>

31
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of Gobbledygook.</v>

32
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of nice words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

33
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's pure speculation at the present</v>

34
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in the laboratory with our finest</v>

35
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>instruments and the latest developments</v>
<v Speaker 1>in artificial intelligence,</v>

36
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>we cannot make a computer become self</v>
<v Speaker 1>aware.</v>

37
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>You realize that one of our most</v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced computers,</v>

38
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the IBM Computer Watson,</v>

39
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 1>which defeated two humans on the the</v>
<v Speaker 1>program jeopardy.</v>

40
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.460
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many pundits said,</v>

41
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end is near.</v>

42
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.210
<v Speaker 1>The robots are going to put us in zoos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to throw a peanut status,</v>

43
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:36.360
<v Speaker 1>make us dance behind bars when they take</v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

44
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Just like we make bear's dance behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>bars today.</v>

45
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just remember that once,</v>

46
00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:44.100
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how fast it is,</v>

47
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>was so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't congratulate it.</v>

48
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.480
<v Speaker 1>You can't go up to Watson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slap it's transitions and say,</v>

49
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>good boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just be two humans on jeopardy.</v>

50
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 1>You made history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's drink to it.</v>

51
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watson is an adding machine,</v>

52
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>a very sophisticated adding machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has billings of times faster than the</v>

53
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 1>human brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's all it is.</v>

54
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 1>It's what it's called an expert system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It deals with formalized inputs,</v>

55
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>formalized outputs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talk to an expert system every time</v>

56
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 1>you're on the telephone and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>telephone says,</v>

57
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>please hit button one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please hit number two for the next</v>

58
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's called an expert system.</v>

59
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>It's basically a sophisticated adding</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>

60
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like it's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

61
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>It's simply using a formalized logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you hit one,</v>

62
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 1>then you go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he had to,</v>

63
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.840
<v Speaker 1>you go someplace else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Watson,</v>

64
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a very,</v>

65
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 1>very sophisticated level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I personally think that we don't have</v>

66
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>to worry that the Internet is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become sentient.</v>

67
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
