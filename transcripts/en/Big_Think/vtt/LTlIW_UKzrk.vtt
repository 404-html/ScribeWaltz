1
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 2>I first and foremost a Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that means not only that I draw my</v>

3
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:14.700
<v Speaker 2>inspiration from the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also for me.</v>

4
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm an Orthodox Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's also from the great creed,</v>

5
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 2>the apostles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creed,</v>

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 2>creed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is a bedrock for my life.</v>

8
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.320
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wouldn't say that I'm a great</v>

9
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Christian in the sense that I can always</v>
<v Speaker 2>do what I think are what to do,</v>

10
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 2>but I tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I once read a book,</v>

11
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by an episcopal done.</v>

12
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are fiscal sponsor and what</v>

13
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.260
<v Speaker 2>triggered what sort of government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>episcopal nun who said that,</v>

14
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't see the future and it's,</v>

15
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 2>you can't tell what God wants to do five</v>
<v Speaker 2>years from now,</v>

16
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:48.160
<v Speaker 2>but if you look carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we take the time to get general,</v>

17
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 2>tell what you're supposed to do right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

18
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I try to think of things that way.</v>

19
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 2>I try to think about what I should do</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

20
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I tend to be a thoughtful person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend to be someone.</v>

21
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't make snap judgments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to take time to think things</v>

22
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.160
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

23
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 2>and then want to make decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend to stick to them but they tend to</v>

24
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 2>be social.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made over a period of time.</v>

25
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 2>We live in a world that encourages snap</v>
<v Speaker 2>judgments,</v>

26
00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:11.870
<v Speaker 2>that rewards thinking fast and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that makes for very good decision.</v>

27
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 2>Making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife I should say is also a great</v>

28
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 2>inspiration to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

29
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife is not only a Christian but</v>

30
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 2>someone who tries to live our faith and</v>
<v Speaker 2>really thinks very hard about the right</v>

31
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 2>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She currently is involved in issues that</v>

32
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 2>I think are of great importance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's apprentice lawyer as I am.</v>

33
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 2>She's working with Jones defense one as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well as being corporate law.</v>

34
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Before that she now affiliated with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of think tanks and she's</v>

35
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:36.620
<v Speaker 2>interested in the future of mothering</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

36
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 2>in America and in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's interested in the</v>

37
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:42.390
<v Speaker 2>commodification of children in two</v>
<v Speaker 2>senses.</v>

38
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Both the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

39
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 2>the sense in which we might say the</v>
<v Speaker 2>commercialization of childhood</v>

40
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 2>advertising aimed at children trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create little consumers and also</v>

41
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 2>commodification of different sense of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the notion of designer babies.</v>

42
00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:55.410
<v Speaker 2>And what does that say about humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about us,</v>

43
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:58.320
<v Speaker 2>and about our future?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't go into these things as a</v>

44
00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 2>shrill advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes to these things to try to</v>

45
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 2>understand the direction we're moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to try to encourage conversations</v>

46
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:07.530
<v Speaker 2>about these directions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I like about her approach is</v>

47
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:10.290
<v Speaker 2>exactly that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she wants to encourage conversation</v>

48
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 2>when she wants to do is create a world</v>
<v Speaker 2>which people think about issues and then</v>

49
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.710
<v Speaker 2>talk about them as opposed to go on</v>
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>

50
00:02:17.711 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 2>You rant and rave about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the kind of work that I</v>

51
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:24.050
<v Speaker 2>wish more advocates would do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of work that I used to</v>

52
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.900
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
