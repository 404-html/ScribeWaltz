1
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.340
<v Speaker 1>James Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a Jesuit priest and author of</v>

2
00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:12.341
<v Speaker 1>the Jesuit Guide to almost everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a jesuit.</v>

3
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:14.810
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a long process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.420
<v Speaker 1>you start a as a jesuit novice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is two years,</v>

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a place called the Novitiate,</v>

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>and you do a combination of prayer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>and working with the poor in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all that,</v>

8
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:26.491
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years,</v>

9
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:28.980
<v Speaker 1>you'd do a 30 day silent retreat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.730
<v Speaker 1>based on what are known as the spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercises of sending Nicholas Loyola,</v>

11
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of an imaginative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>placing yourself in the gospel scenes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of accompanying Jesus through</v>

13
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:40.710
<v Speaker 1>the Gospel scenes imaginative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the Novitiate,</v>

15
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>you take a what are called your simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>vows of poverty,</v>

16
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:47.930
<v Speaker 1>chastity and obedience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

17
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 1>after that you do what's called first</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies,</v>

18
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 1>which is a combination of a philosophy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and theology.</v>

19
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then following that you do three</v>

20
00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 1>years of full time work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called in the Jesuits,</v>

21
00:00:58.531 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>a regency.</v>

22
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most jesuits like to,</v>

23
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach.</v>

24
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>They'll teach in a high school</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

25
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 1>I worked a overseas at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Jesuit refugee service helping</v>

26
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>refugees in east Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start small businesses for themselves.</v>

27
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>So after that three years has done a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to theology studies and a you</v>

28
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 1>three or four years of theology studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're a priest,</v>

29
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get ordained at the end.</v>

30
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>There's Jesuit brothers as well on</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are jesuits but are not a</v>

31
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>call to the priesthood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

32
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Speaker 1>and then after ordination you work full</v>
<v Speaker 1>time for a couple of years.</v>

33
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm working in a Catholic magazine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally,</v>

34
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of probably five or six years</v>

35
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take what are called your final</v>

36
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 1>vows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the whole process is pretty long.</v>

37
00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>It took me a 21 years to become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>jesuit,</v>

38
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:46.644
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a little too long for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>taste.</v>

40
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty average.</v>

41
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:52.380
<v Speaker 1>It takes about 20 years to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.610
<v Speaker 1>to become a full fledged jesuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

43
00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>I like to say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like being a made man in the mafia</v>
<v Speaker 1>or getting tenure at a university or a</v>

45
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>becoming a partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

46
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>you've been in for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

47
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.380
<v Speaker 1>but you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're finally finally fully accepted.</v>

48
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>So it's a pretty long process.</v>

49
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Poverty is one of the three vows that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>take.</v>

50
00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:15.580
<v Speaker 1>We take a vow of poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chastity,</v>

51
00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:16.750
<v Speaker 1>and obedience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

52
00:02:16.751 --> 00:02:17.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:19.780
<v Speaker 1>initially stand Ignatius Loyola,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:22.030
<v Speaker 1>when he had his conversion experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

55
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was injured in a battle,</v>

56
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and was taken home to recuperate and</v>

57
00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:29.800
<v Speaker 1>started to think about doing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>else with his life.</v>

58
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.020
<v Speaker 1>He became very aesthetical and gave up</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and really live like a</v>

59
00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:36.820
<v Speaker 1>hermit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lived in a cave,</v>

60
00:02:36.821 --> 00:02:39.550
<v Speaker 1>let his fingernails grow long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hair grow long.</v>

61
00:02:39.551 --> 00:02:43.990
<v Speaker 1>And ultimately he realized that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't really doing her much good and he</v>

62
00:02:43.991 --> 00:02:46.120
<v Speaker 1>needed to moderate some of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

63
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.340
<v Speaker 1>he ended up going back to school to</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>

64
00:02:48.341 --> 00:02:49.270
<v Speaker 1>And so he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

65
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.720
<v Speaker 1>jesuits should be free of material</v>
<v Speaker 1>possessions,</v>

66
00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:54.380
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.890
<v Speaker 1>like they're hermits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're living in a cave and eating</v>

68
00:02:56.891 --> 00:02:58.150
<v Speaker 1>twigs and things like that.</v>

69
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a complete poverty.</v>

70
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>So Jesuit poverty is really about</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

71
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 1>It's about the freedom of not owning</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

72
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>It's about the freedom of living simply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

73
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>and it's also about the freedom to not</v>
<v Speaker 1>let anything,</v>

74
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>any possessions come in between you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

75
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>

76
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to help us identify with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor,</v>

77
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we do a lot of work with the poor.</v>

78
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

79
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 1>we're supposed to try to live as close</v>
<v Speaker 1>as possible to,</v>

80
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's indignation is calls a,</v>

81
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 1>a family of slender means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 1>people who don't have a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>

83
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to model Christ.</v>

84
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.791
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

85
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he lived on the earth was living</v>

86
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>very simply as a very simple man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those are the three things.</v>

87
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>It frees us up for service that it makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it so we don't have a lot of</v>

88
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 1>possessions to kind of like tie us down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

89
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.640
<v Speaker 1>it helps us identify with the poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

90
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>and it's an imitation of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really trying to follow Christ in</v>

91
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:53.884
<v Speaker 1>more closely.</v>

92
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chasse that he's the most difficult</v>

93
00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 1>thing to explain about religious life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

94
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>most people think it's crazy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy or a natural,</v>

95
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sex abuse crisis,</v>

96
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:09.010
<v Speaker 1>people think that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sex abuse crisis came from jazz city</v>

97
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>or from celibacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

98
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 1>but it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I see it,</v>

99
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>a different way to love a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not for everybody.</v>

100
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly,</v>

101
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people are called to romantic love</v>

102
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:20.180
<v Speaker 1>and married lives and having children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

103
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.290
<v Speaker 1>but for some of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

104
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>it works and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really what it is,</v>

105
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a loving many people freely and</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply.</v>

106
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>You're not attached to just one person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have an exclusive</v>

107
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're free to love many people,</v>

108
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 1>which is not to say the people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>married or are in a romantic</v>

109
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't love many people.</v>

110
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 1>It's just to say that this is what works</v>
<v Speaker 1>best for people in religious orders.</v>

111
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>And I find it very freeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

112
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 1>I find people can be freer with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

113
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:47.081
<v Speaker 1>in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

114
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:48.970
<v Speaker 1>when I become close friends with</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

115
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.360
<v Speaker 1>they're not wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he becoming friends because of sex?</v>

116
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does he have an ulterior motive?</v>

117
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

118
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 1>men and women can feel comfortable with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

119
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:58.701
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really a,</v>

120
00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:00.160
<v Speaker 1>in a practical level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

121
00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>it makes you a lot more mobile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

122
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 1>you're not in a sense worried about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife or husband,</v>

123
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be thinking about.</v>

124
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>You're moving or taking a new job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it can be very freeing,</v>

125
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 1>but it really freaks people out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me chastity really,</v>

126
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a culture that values sex,</v>

127
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:17.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rightly,</v>

128
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much.</v>

129
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really disturbs people,</v>

130
00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

131
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those,</v>

132
00:05:24.521 --> 00:05:26.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are called to it,</v>

133
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 1>it can work very well if you live at in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a healthy way,</v>

134
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 1>meaning if you have friends and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy work and healthy prayer life.</v>

135
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm all for it,</v>

136
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:34.670
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

137
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.710
<v Speaker 1>it's not for everybody.</v>

138
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.220
<v Speaker 1>I worked for GE for six years and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

139
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I had studied the Wharton School of</v>
<v Speaker 1>business beforehand,</v>

140
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before entering Ge.</v>

141
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

142
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.490
<v Speaker 1>after about six years I started to</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that this really wasn't for me.</v>

143
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.301
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:55.750
<v Speaker 1>business was a real vocation as it were</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of my friends.</v>

145
00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:56.321
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

146
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 1>I just got more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more miserable,</v>

147
00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the workload got,</v>

148
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more difficult as anyone who works in</v>

149
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>the corporate world knows it can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>really stressful.</v>

150
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.510
<v Speaker 1>And I saw some friends of mine really</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoying the work a while.</v>

151
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 1>I just seem to get bored by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

152
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>at the same time I was getting all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>stomach problems and,</v>

153
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of stress related illnesses.</v>

154
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.320
<v Speaker 1>One night I came home dead tired after</v>
<v Speaker 1>this long day of work and I sort of</v>

155
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 1>plopped down on our couch and turn on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the TV.</v>

156
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 1>And there was this pbs documentary about</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy named Thomas Merton who was a</v>

157
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:30.920
<v Speaker 1>trappist monk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cloistered monk,</v>

158
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had never heard of him.</v>

159
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 1>And the documentary really just</v>
<v Speaker 1>captivated me.</v>

160
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the look on his face,</v>

161
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

162
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:39.960
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

163
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.280
<v Speaker 1>spoke this great sense of joy and peace</v>
<v Speaker 1>and calm and consolation.</v>

164
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 1>And it really called out to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

165
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was so interesting,</v>

166
00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 1>that one documentary that I went out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>purchased his autobiography,</v>

167
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:53.950
<v Speaker 1>the Seventh Story Mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

168
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty well known in Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 1>circles.</v>

169
00:06:56.301 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>I'd never heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I devoured it.</v>

170
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 1>I read it in a couple of nights and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

171
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I really couldn't get it out of my mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's what I wanted to do.</v>

172
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Something like what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

173
00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:08.390
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't particularly religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

174
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.430
<v Speaker 1>I was Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't Super Catholic.</v>

175
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 1>I never thought of anything like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

176
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.640
<v Speaker 1>And I read a lot about Thomas Merton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one day I went up to my parish</v>

177
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:18.290
<v Speaker 1>priest and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd be interested in being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>priest,</v>

179
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:24.140
<v Speaker 1>which was kind of weird because he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>never even met me before.</v>

180
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.461
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

181
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:28.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should talk to the local diocese.</v>

182
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might want to talk to the</v>

183
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:34.040
<v Speaker 1>jesuits who were up the street at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fairfield University in Connecticut.</v>

184
00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:36.020
<v Speaker 1>That was the only connection I had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jesuits.</v>

185
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.980
<v Speaker 1>So I visited the jesuits at Fairfield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gave me some,</v>

186
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:40.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

187
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.210
<v Speaker 1>vocational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

188
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of promotional literature about the</v>

189
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:47.150
<v Speaker 1>jesuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I read it and I thought,</v>

190
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:48.860
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

191
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.470
<v Speaker 1>actually ripped it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>threw it away and thought,</v>

192
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:52.880
<v Speaker 1>this is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

193
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.680
<v Speaker 1>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not who I am,</v>

194
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.211
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

195
00:07:56.211 --> 00:07:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I read some more and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and continued to read.</v>

196
00:07:58.401 --> 00:08:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the same time I started to go to</v>

197
00:08:00.951 --> 00:08:04.460
<v Speaker 1>a psychologist because of all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress related stomach problems as a</v>

198
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:08.690
<v Speaker 1>result of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm reading and thinking and</v>

199
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 1>going to the psychologist at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

200
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Speaker 1>And finally one day he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

201
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:14.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in this,</v>

202
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>business world and you don't seem very</v>

203
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what would you do if you could do</v>

204
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:21.230
<v Speaker 1>anything you wanted to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought for a moment,</v>

205
00:08:21.231 --> 00:08:21.801
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

206
00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:24.670
<v Speaker 1>I'd be a Jesuit priest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

207
00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:25.161
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

208
00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:27.290
<v Speaker 1>why don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

209
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't I so,</v>

210
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it made sense.</v>

211
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:33.170
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

212
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:35.870
<v Speaker 1>this is really something that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually interested in.</v>

213
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Why am I doing something that I dislike?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

214
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.490
<v Speaker 1>So I called the jesuits and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

215
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.800
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know who I was and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready to enter.</v>

216
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:43.783
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

217
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.990
<v Speaker 1>they were nice enough to sort of start</v>
<v Speaker 1>me on the application process,</v>

218
00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 1>which took a couple months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a couple of months later I was in,</v>

219
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 1>so it was pretty rushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

220
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.430
<v Speaker 1>but I just say looking back on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably,</v>

221
00:08:56.431 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the best decision I've ever made.</v>

222
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say St Ignatius Loyola,</v>

223
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:08.511
<v Speaker 1>the founder of the Jesuits who lived</v>
<v Speaker 1>from 1491 to 1556,</v>

224
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

225
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:12.420
<v Speaker 1>his spirituality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can be summarized as finding God</v>

226
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:13.810
<v Speaker 1>in all things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

227
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 1>or being a contemplative in action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person who is,</v>

228
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:21.930
<v Speaker 1>has a sense of awareness in the midst of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very busy world has really changed the</v>

229
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:23.350
<v Speaker 1>way I live my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

230
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.121
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

231
00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in Ignatius's is kind of the model</v>

232
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:28.260
<v Speaker 1>for all jesuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

233
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.580
<v Speaker 1>but I don't just like Jesuit saints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also like a saint therese of Lisieux</v>

234
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:37.050
<v Speaker 1>who was a 19th century Carmelite nun who</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived,</v>

235
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what she called her little way,</v>

236
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 1>which was basically doing small things</v>
<v Speaker 1>with great love for God.</v>

237
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

238
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blessed blessing John the 23rd,</v>

239
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was pope from 1958 to 1963.</v>

240
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it was so funny.</v>

241
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

242
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 1>one joke from John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 23rd,</v>

243
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:58.830
<v Speaker 1>a journalist asked him once how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people work in the Vatican and he said</v>

244
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.750
<v Speaker 1>about half of them going know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

245
00:10:00.751 --> 00:10:03.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he shows you can be someone with a sense</v>

246
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:04.340
<v Speaker 1>of humor and be a saint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

247
00:10:04.341 --> 00:10:08.180
<v Speaker 1>and then finally Thomas Merton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the a fellow whose book I read who Kinda</v>

248
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.810
<v Speaker 1>got him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started on religious life.</v>

249
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:12.120
<v Speaker 1>So those are my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say top four.</v>

250
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to believe in God to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>his insights useful.</v>

251
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helps to understand the totality of</v>

252
00:10:20.581 --> 00:10:24.990
<v Speaker 1>his message because a jesuit</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirituality without God or without</v>

253
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

254
00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:29.820
<v Speaker 1>we'll only make partial sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that being said,</v>

255
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saint Ignatius knew that people were on</v>

256
00:10:31.771 --> 00:10:33.170
<v Speaker 1>different paths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

257
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.820
<v Speaker 1>in their life to God and different paths</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general.</v>

258
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:40.440
<v Speaker 1>And so many of the insights are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful to people who are,</v>

259
00:10:40.441 --> 00:10:42.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only devout believers,</v>

260
00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:45.870
<v Speaker 1>but even doubtful seekers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are agnostic or atheist</v>

261
00:10:45.871 --> 00:10:46.704
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

262
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.980
<v Speaker 1>he talks about how to make decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

263
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.630
<v Speaker 1>living freely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

264
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.410
<v Speaker 1>how to be a good friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

265
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.360
<v Speaker 1>how to work well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

266
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.890
<v Speaker 1>how to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

267
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.520
<v Speaker 1>in a healthy relationship with somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of things that you can</v>

268
00:10:59.521 --> 00:11:01.980
<v Speaker 1>take from the way of sand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignatius,</v>

269
00:11:01.981 --> 00:11:04.130
<v Speaker 1>that are applicable to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

270
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.510
<v Speaker 1>but it really to understand it in its</v>
<v Speaker 1>totality,</v>

271
00:11:06.511 --> 00:11:08.730
<v Speaker 1>you have to see it as sort of a path to</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

272
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:11.160
<v Speaker 1>So I like to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

273
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.800
<v Speaker 1>anyone can benefit from the way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>setting niches,</v>

274
00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:18.570
<v Speaker 1>but to get to the final and you really</v>
<v Speaker 1>do have to keep your eyes focused on</v>

275
00:11:18.571 --> 00:11:19.404
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

276
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.150
<v Speaker 1>A lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

277
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.350
<v Speaker 1>ignation spirituality talks about</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire.</v>

278
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's sort of a,</v>

279
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 1>a bad word and some spiritual circles</v>
<v Speaker 1>because some people equate it with just</v>

280
00:11:30.631 --> 00:11:31.790
<v Speaker 1>selfish wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

281
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a new car,</v>

282
00:11:32.821 --> 00:11:35.100
<v Speaker 1>I want a new iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a new pc,</v>

283
00:11:35.101 --> 00:11:36.320
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

284
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.850
<v Speaker 1>or they think of it as sexual desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

285
00:11:38.851 --> 00:11:39.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my Gosh,</v>

286
00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:41.550
<v Speaker 1>God forbid we should talk about sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire.</v>

287
00:11:41.551 --> 00:11:41.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

288
00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.020
<v Speaker 1>that's healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

289
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.560
<v Speaker 1>But desire on an even deeper level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

290
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.690
<v Speaker 1>is the desire that we have to be who we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are to be our true selves and the desire</v>

291
00:11:51.691 --> 00:11:52.790
<v Speaker 1>for God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

292
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.080
<v Speaker 1>and there's also desires that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

293
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>lead us to our vocations and what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do in life.</v>

294
00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.590
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

295
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a married couple might discover their</v>

296
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:06.370
<v Speaker 1>vocations through desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the desire for sexual intimacy,</v>

297
00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>for uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional intimacy,</v>

298
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a,</v>

299
00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:13.930
<v Speaker 1>a sort of connectedness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that brings them together.</v>

300
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.030
<v Speaker 1>People understand that in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire,</v>

301
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.750
<v Speaker 1>desire works the same way in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our jobs and our vocations.</v>

302
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

303
00:12:20.861 --> 00:12:24.730
<v Speaker 1>someone who was interested in a video</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be interested in it because they</v>

304
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:26.680
<v Speaker 1>feel this attraction to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>

305
00:12:26.681 --> 00:12:30.250
<v Speaker 1>They feel this desire for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone who's a doctor might find,</v>

306
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about medicine and the body</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things like that,</v>

307
00:12:33.881 --> 00:12:35.140
<v Speaker 1>just really attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

308
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.640
<v Speaker 1>so desires is really important thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to and ultimately our</v>

309
00:12:39.641 --> 00:12:40.530
<v Speaker 1>desires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

310
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:41.483
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

311
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.570
<v Speaker 1>our deepest desires are God's desires</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us really and,</v>

312
00:12:45.571 --> 00:12:48.130
<v Speaker 1>and the deepest desires we have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>our true self,</v>

313
00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:51.790
<v Speaker 1>to really live out who we're meant to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what we're meant to do are the ways</v>

314
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:56.590
<v Speaker 1>that God has of drawing us to happiness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also the ways that God has of</v>

315
00:12:56.591 --> 00:12:57.371
<v Speaker 1>drawing us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

316
00:12:57.371 --> 00:12:59.680
<v Speaker 1>to fulfill God's desires for the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

317
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we should be too hard on</v>

318
00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:05.170
<v Speaker 1>desire and the spiritual life or in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of life.</v>

319
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we can find true</v>

320
00:13:10.031 --> 00:13:11.310
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

321
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this side of life.</v>

322
00:13:13.061 --> 00:13:14.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always going to be certain</v>

323
00:13:14.201 --> 00:13:16.840
<v Speaker 1>suffering and struggles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has problems in their life.</v>

324
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:17.703
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>

325
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can attain a great sense of joy and</v>

326
00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:24.670
<v Speaker 1>peace if your life is centered on God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that sounds really cheesy,</v>

327
00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:26.410
<v Speaker 1>which does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means,</v>

328
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the ignition,</v>

329
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.490
<v Speaker 1>a way of looking at things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jesuit way of looking at things,</v>

330
00:13:30.491 --> 00:13:34.090
<v Speaker 1>a lot of freedom and detachment from</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that keep you from being</v>

331
00:13:34.091 --> 00:13:37.300
<v Speaker 1>connected to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that being grateful for the</v>

332
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:39.440
<v Speaker 1>things that are blessings in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

333
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.300
<v Speaker 1>it means as a contemplative in action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being aware of all the blessings you</v>

334
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.910
<v Speaker 1>have in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a certain amount of suffering is</v>

335
00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:48.790
<v Speaker 1>inevitable in anyone's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think any religion,</v>

336
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:51.310
<v Speaker 1>any really healthy religion will tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you that.</v>

337
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.173
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

338
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full joy I think is only achieved with</v>

339
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:55.780
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

340
00:13:55.781 --> 00:13:56.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the afterlife,</v>

341
00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:57.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God willing.</v>

342
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.590
<v Speaker 1>But I think you can experience a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>joy in your life today on earth.</v>

343
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.083
<v Speaker 1>Thank God.</v>

344
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes your own shows where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are aggressive or confrontational.</v>

345
00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:15.010
<v Speaker 1>And it's a important to remember always</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be charitable because,</v>

346
00:14:15.011 --> 00:14:15.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm talking,</v>

347
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:19.060
<v Speaker 1>it's not just representing me or talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about my book.</v>

348
00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm also for better or worse</v>
<v Speaker 1>representing the church.</v>

349
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.900
<v Speaker 1>And so if I come off as being</v>
<v Speaker 1>argumentative or mean or snappish or</v>

350
00:14:25.901 --> 00:14:27.160
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people will say,</v>

351
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:27.431
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

352
00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:28.450
<v Speaker 1>the Catholic church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

353
00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:29.710
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

354
00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:30.910
<v Speaker 1>they're being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

355
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.150
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So charities,</v>

356
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:34.570
<v Speaker 1>the first thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

357
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.520
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

358
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:38.740
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes get nervous about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

359
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.870
<v Speaker 1>the topics that people choose to bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

360
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:42.220
<v Speaker 1>You never know what they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring up.</v>

361
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on Kobe or it's a lot of fun.</v>

362
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.733
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

363
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.260
<v Speaker 1>he himself as a Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I know that he understands what I'm</v>

364
00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:48.200
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

365
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.660
<v Speaker 1>he's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

366
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 1>one of the great challenges of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>that chose just not laughing.</v>

367
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so outrageous sometimes and so</v>

368
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:59.900
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable that the things he says</v>
<v Speaker 1>just make me laugh.</v>

369
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:01.390
<v Speaker 1>One time I was on and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

370
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.590
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about the recession and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

371
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.640
<v Speaker 1>how people find God in the midst of</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult times.</v>

372
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:09.140
<v Speaker 1>And I said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

373
00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:12.080
<v Speaker 1>were sometimes more open to God's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

374
00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:14.510
<v Speaker 1>activity in our lives when we're more</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable,</v>

375
00:15:14.511 --> 00:15:16.070
<v Speaker 1>which is true because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

376
00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:19.340
<v Speaker 1>when our defenses are down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can let God and more easily,</v>

377
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.440
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which happens when people are sick or</v>

378
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:23.870
<v Speaker 1>when they're going through difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

379
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

380
00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:28.100
<v Speaker 1>you make God sound like an opportunistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>

381
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.070
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I do,</v>

382
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.260
<v Speaker 1>but it was hard not to laugh because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was so silly.</v>

383
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.191
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

384
00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:35.750
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoy being on the show.</v>

385
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand are people who say that</v>

386
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Anti Catholicism is just as bad as</v>
<v Speaker 1>antisemitism or homophobia or racism.</v>

387
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as virulent and not as</v>

388
00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:51.320
<v Speaker 1>prevalent on the other end are people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that say it doesn't exist at all.</v>

389
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:52.221
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

390
00:15:52.221 --> 00:15:53.860
<v Speaker 1>but it does basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

391
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.930
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of portrayals of nuns and</v>
<v Speaker 1>priests,</v>

392
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on TV and in the movies or</v>

393
00:15:58.881 --> 00:16:00.560
<v Speaker 1>stereotypical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

394
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>post sex abuse crisis frequently when</v>

395
00:16:03.021 --> 00:16:06.710
<v Speaker 1>you see a pre show up on a TV cop show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

396
00:16:06.711 --> 00:16:09.950
<v Speaker 1>he's usually a pedophile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A nuns are usually portrayed as like</v>

397
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.350
<v Speaker 1>ninnies basically are stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

398
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here are women who kind of built the</v>

399
00:16:14.601 --> 00:16:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Catholic healthcare system in the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States and ran universities and,</v>

400
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:19.420
<v Speaker 1>but when they come on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

401
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.500
<v Speaker 1>they're portrayed as being idiots</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

402
00:16:21.501 --> 00:16:24.380
<v Speaker 1>So there some subtle Antica phalluses</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that,</v>

403
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:25.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

404
00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:27.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:31.640
<v Speaker 1>you hear people taking pot shots at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>priest for being celibate or being</v>

406
00:16:31.641 --> 00:16:34.520
<v Speaker 1>pedophiles are being insane or whatever.</v>

407
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.250
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's a lot of stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>slides by,</v>

408
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

409
00:16:38.841 --> 00:16:43.100
<v Speaker 1>on TV and in the movies that would never</v>
<v Speaker 1>be allowed to happen with other groups.</v>

410
00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:44.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you portrayed it rabbi or an</v>

411
00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:48.470
<v Speaker 1>email like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would rightfully complained.</v>

412
00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:51.290
<v Speaker 1>But in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because we live in a largely</v>

413
00:16:51.291 --> 00:16:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Protestant culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

414
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.730
<v Speaker 1>I think because of the sex abuse crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think because of,</v>

415
00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:56.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

416
00:16:56.751 --> 00:17:01.220
<v Speaker 1>some suspicion about the Vatican and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholic theology in a sense anti</v>

417
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism is more acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

418
00:17:03.531 --> 00:17:06.140
<v Speaker 1>one person once called it the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable prejudice.</v>

419
00:17:06.141 --> 00:17:08.120
<v Speaker 1>So it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

420
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:12.590
<v Speaker 1>but I think we need to keep in sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>context exactly what that means.</v>

421
00:17:12.591 --> 00:17:15.380
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as virulent as it as some other</v>

422
00:17:15.381 --> 00:17:17.390
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is present.</v>

423
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it's gotten worse because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex abuse crisis.</v>

424
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:24.171
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

425
00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:27.260
<v Speaker 1>I think things are said about priests</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Celibacy,</v>

426
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are,</v>

427
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes basically.</v>

428
00:17:29.961 --> 00:17:33.770
<v Speaker 1>So you take a very small population of</v>
<v Speaker 1>priests who have committed these crimes,</v>

429
00:17:33.771 --> 00:17:35.240
<v Speaker 1>then you magnify it and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

430
00:17:35.241 --> 00:17:37.430
<v Speaker 1>that applies to all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Praise then and,</v>

431
00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:37.731
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

432
00:17:37.731 --> 00:17:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I reached out in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

433
00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream newspapers and on tv and you</v>

434
00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:44.240
<v Speaker 1>hear jokes and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

435
00:17:44.241 --> 00:17:45.470
<v Speaker 1>as a priest myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

436
00:17:45.471 --> 00:17:47.050
<v Speaker 1>who keeps his valves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

437
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>it's offensive basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I often say to people,</v>

438
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:51.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you say this about rabbis?</v>

439
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you say this about the moms?</v>

440
00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:56.670
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But somehow people think,</v>

441
00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the sex abuse crisis,</v>

442
00:17:59.701 --> 00:18:01.830
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to stereotype all Catholics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

443
00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:03.030
<v Speaker 1>all Catholics are like this.</v>

444
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.000
<v Speaker 1>All bishops are like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all priests are like this and which</v>

445
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:07.790
<v Speaker 1>would never fly for any other religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>

446
00:18:07.791 --> 00:18:12.791
<v Speaker 1>So I just think it's a basically unfair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's really started to do some</v>

447
00:18:15.631 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 1>really important things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is meeting with the victims,</v>

448
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during his visit to Deanna to the United</v>

449
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.730
<v Speaker 1>States was a historic and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented.</v>

450
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think though that there's always more</v>

451
00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:29.850
<v Speaker 1>that can be done for the sex abuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis in 2002,</v>

452
00:18:29.851 --> 00:18:31.810
<v Speaker 1>the US bishops met in Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

453
00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 1>to formulate their a zero tolerance</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy,</v>

454
00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:36.630
<v Speaker 1>which I think was necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

455
00:18:36.631 --> 00:18:37.920
<v Speaker 1>but I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

456
00:18:37.921 --> 00:18:41.130
<v Speaker 1>the clerical culture that gave rise to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a sex abuse crisis,</v>

457
00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:42.900
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

458
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:45.370
<v Speaker 1>a few very sick men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

459
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.460
<v Speaker 1>who were moved around from parish to</v>
<v Speaker 1>parish,</v>

460
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.271
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

461
00:18:48.271 --> 00:18:49.680
<v Speaker 1>by some bishops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

462
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for fear of quote unquote causing</v>

463
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:54.930
<v Speaker 1>scandal that that's more of a cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>type thing.</v>

464
00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that needs to be addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think what the church needs to do</v>

465
00:18:57.481 --> 00:19:00.420
<v Speaker 1>is to have a culture of much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>transparency.</v>

466
00:19:00.421 --> 00:19:01.171
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and frankly,</v>

467
00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:03.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when these guys do these things,</v>

468
00:19:03.661 --> 00:19:05.820
<v Speaker 1>they need to be kicked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in the United States,</v>

469
00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:07.100
<v Speaker 1>that's already happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

470
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.720
<v Speaker 1>so I don't think you'll see it in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

471
00:19:09.721 --> 00:19:12.630
<v Speaker 1>You might hear reports of ones that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

472
00:19:12.631 --> 00:19:14.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe in the sixties and seventies.</v>

473
00:19:14.281 --> 00:19:15.300
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

474
00:19:15.301 --> 00:19:18.000
<v Speaker 1>going ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is the zero tolerance policy.</v>

475
00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think other countries are starting to</v>

476
00:19:20.131 --> 00:19:21.340
<v Speaker 1>realize that now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

477
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.210
<v Speaker 1>what needs to be done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really needs to be just sort of taken</v>

478
00:19:24.211 --> 00:19:27.000
<v Speaker 1>out root and branch and blamed on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right sources.</v>

479
00:19:27.001 --> 00:19:30.150
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with celibacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has nothing to do with,</v>

480
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:30.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

481
00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:32.460
<v Speaker 1>gay clergy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

482
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Neither of those two things lead to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pedophilia.</v>

483
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.330
<v Speaker 1>It has to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think with this culture of secrecy and</v>

484
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.180
<v Speaker 1>the wrong headed notion that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't quote unquote cause scandal by</v>

485
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:43.790
<v Speaker 1>revealing some of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

486
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.380
<v Speaker 1>so I hope the Catholic Church really</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes the lead,</v>

487
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in showing other organizations about</v>

488
00:19:49.531 --> 00:19:51.120
<v Speaker 1>this because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

489
00:19:51.121 --> 00:19:53.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean most sex abuse takes place in</v>
<v Speaker 1>families,</v>

490
00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their sex abuse in schools or sex abuse</v>

491
00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:59.280
<v Speaker 1>in children's organizations like the boy</v>
<v Speaker 1>scouts and the girl scouts.</v>

492
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.850
<v Speaker 1>So I think that the Catholic Church has</v>
<v Speaker 1>an opportunity here to really take the</v>

493
00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:07.440
<v Speaker 1>lead and be in the vanguard of</v>
<v Speaker 1>preventing children from being abused.</v>

494
00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Glenn Beck's comment really betrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a fundamental misunderstanding</v>

495
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:16.320
<v Speaker 1>of the Gospel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

496
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

497
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Jesus in the 25th Chapter of the Gospel</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Matthew basically says that the</v>

498
00:20:22.501 --> 00:20:26.550
<v Speaker 1>litmus test for how we're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>judged at the end of our lives is not</v>

499
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.340
<v Speaker 1>what church we pray in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we pray,</v>

500
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.100
<v Speaker 1>even how often we'd go to church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how we treat the poor.</v>

501
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty cut and dried.</v>

502
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to enter into heaven,</v>

503
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.070
<v Speaker 1>treat the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

504
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

505
00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice is a way of looking at</v>

506
00:20:42.511 --> 00:20:44.310
<v Speaker 1>what keeps people poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

507
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:48.020
<v Speaker 1>and as the church and its 2000 year</v>
<v Speaker 1>history has reflected on Jesus's</v>

508
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.500
<v Speaker 1>commandment to serve the poor and love</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor,</v>

509
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.710
<v Speaker 1>it's realized that we need to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>what keeps them poor.</v>

510
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not enough to just give someone a</v>

511
00:20:55.481 --> 00:20:57.550
<v Speaker 1>handout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As important as that is,</v>

512
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.250
<v Speaker 1>it's important to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at what keeps the people poor.</v>

513
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.030
<v Speaker 1>So someone told me the other day the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gospel story of the,</v>

514
00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:04.751
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

515
00:21:04.751 --> 00:21:08.770
<v Speaker 1>the Good Samaritan where the guy sees</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone by the side of the road who has</v>

516
00:21:08.771 --> 00:21:12.250
<v Speaker 1>been beaten and he takes care of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He brings it back to an end.</v>

517
00:21:12.251 --> 00:21:14.890
<v Speaker 1>He dresses his wounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gives him money for the,</v>

518
00:21:14.891 --> 00:21:16.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for staying overnight.</v>

519
00:21:16.061 --> 00:21:17.330
<v Speaker 1>In the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

520
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.650
<v Speaker 1>someone said to me today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd also be looking at why that road is</v>

521
00:21:20.651 --> 00:21:22.240
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

522
00:21:22.241 --> 00:21:24.040
<v Speaker 1>what is it that makes that road</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous?</v>

523
00:21:24.041 --> 00:21:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we fix the situations that lead</v>

524
00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:29.080
<v Speaker 1>for crime and things like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

525
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.050
<v Speaker 1>so that's what social justices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basically working for justice</v>

526
00:21:32.051 --> 00:21:33.430
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

527
00:21:33.431 --> 00:21:35.710
<v Speaker 1>how anybody can be against that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond me,</v>

528
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.100
<v Speaker 1>frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He compared to people who support social</v>

529
00:21:39.101 --> 00:21:42.490
<v Speaker 1>justice to Stalin and Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

530
00:21:42.491 --> 00:21:44.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just found that,</v>

531
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.760
<v Speaker 1>frankly outrageous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there've been people other than me that</v>

532
00:21:48.761 --> 00:21:49.540
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

533
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.400
<v Speaker 1>talked about this and he's responded by</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

534
00:21:51.401 --> 00:21:52.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean this.</v>

535
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.570
<v Speaker 1>I what I meant was this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I meant that charities,</v>

536
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.630
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's not,</v>

537
00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.341
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

538
00:21:57.341 --> 00:21:59.260
<v Speaker 1>a sponsored by the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

539
00:21:59.290 --> 00:21:59.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>

540
00:21:59.951 --> 00:22:03.160
<v Speaker 1>how else does the community respond?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

541
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.140
<v Speaker 1>socially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than through governmental</v>

542
00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:05.771
<v Speaker 1>policies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

543
00:22:05.771 --> 00:22:09.220
<v Speaker 1>you can do things individually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do things in church,</v>

544
00:22:09.221 --> 00:22:10.600
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

545
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.550
<v Speaker 1>we have all sorts of public works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

546
00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:16.210
<v Speaker 1>in terms of social security and Medicare</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Medicaid and,</v>

547
00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:18.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even like public transportation.</v>

548
00:22:18.011 --> 00:22:19.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in a sense is providing for the</v>

549
00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:21.490
<v Speaker 1>common good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

550
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.280
<v Speaker 1>so I still think he basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

551
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:28.000
<v Speaker 1>just doesn't like the idea of helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor.</v>

552
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:28.520
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

553
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I think oftentimes this critique of</v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice is really just a thinly</v>

554
00:22:32.591 --> 00:22:35.590
<v Speaker 1>veiled excuse for not wanting to deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the poor.</v>

555
00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:37.390
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people find the poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

556
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.210
<v Speaker 1>as Pope John Paul said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>irksome intruders,</v>

557
00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into our comfortable life.</v>

558
00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.830
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what good is the gospel if it doesn't</v>

559
00:22:44.831 --> 00:22:47.260
<v Speaker 1>disturb you as supposed to disturb you?</v>

560
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hip to be spiritual but not</v>

561
00:22:52.751 --> 00:22:53.830
<v Speaker 1>religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

562
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.080
<v Speaker 1>almost everybody I know says their</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual now.</v>

563
00:22:56.081 --> 00:22:57.130
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

564
00:22:57.131 --> 00:22:59.350
<v Speaker 1>spiritual is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spiritual means the,</v>

565
00:22:59.351 --> 00:23:02.110
<v Speaker 1>you have a relationship with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spiritual means that you,</v>

566
00:23:02.111 --> 00:23:05.020
<v Speaker 1>you connect with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That a spirituality is an important part</v>

567
00:23:05.021 --> 00:23:06.730
<v Speaker 1>of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you try to lead a good life.</v>

568
00:23:06.731 --> 00:23:11.380
<v Speaker 1>He try to be in concert with a what your</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with God tells you,</v>

569
00:23:11.381 --> 00:23:12.600
<v Speaker 1>which is terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>

570
00:23:12.601 --> 00:23:14.070
<v Speaker 1>you have to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

571
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.710
<v Speaker 1>religious on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

572
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.350
<v Speaker 1>in current parlance is bad because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to say that,</v>

573
00:23:20.351 --> 00:23:21.700
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in this,</v>

574
00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:23.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization that has all these</v>

575
00:23:23.621 --> 00:23:27.010
<v Speaker 1>hidebound dogmas and beliefs and I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>never be able to,</v>

576
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>belong to an organization that tells me</v>

577
00:23:29.411 --> 00:23:30.730
<v Speaker 1>what to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like that.</v>

578
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with being spiritual but not</v>

579
00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:36.820
<v Speaker 1>religious is that you're not part of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>community in a sense.</v>

580
00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's no one to sort of bump up</v>

581
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:41.470
<v Speaker 1>against to tell you when you might be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little off track,</v>

582
00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

583
00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not really able to connect,</v>

584
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your spiritual life with other</v>

585
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:50.750
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a great saying from Isaac</v>

586
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Hecker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was the 19th century,</v>

587
00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American priest and he said,</v>

588
00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:56.110
<v Speaker 1>religion enables us to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

589
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.420
<v Speaker 1>connect and correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we connect with other people were</v>

590
00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:00.890
<v Speaker 1>naturally social animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

591
00:24:00.891 --> 00:24:03.110
<v Speaker 1>And we like to worship in common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

592
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.210
<v Speaker 1>We connect with one another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

593
00:24:05.211 --> 00:24:06.740
<v Speaker 1>and were corrected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

594
00:24:06.741 --> 00:24:07.574
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

595
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I have a direct line to God,</v>

596
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that by definition,</v>

597
00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:13.970
<v Speaker 1>anything I think or say is from God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

598
00:24:13.971 --> 00:24:18.770
<v Speaker 1>And that's as we know a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So being spiritual without being</v>

599
00:24:18.771 --> 00:24:21.620
<v Speaker 1>religious means that you're lacking kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the wisdom of the community,</v>

600
00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:23.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as the support of the community.</v>

601
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:24.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

602
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.000
<v Speaker 1>when you're sort of struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

603
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.030
<v Speaker 1>being religious without being spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just as bad.</v>

604
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Being religious without being spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>just means all you're doing is following</v>

605
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:34.190
<v Speaker 1>the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just following the rules.</v>

606
00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.760
<v Speaker 1>You're just listening to the community</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet you're not reflecting on things,</v>

607
00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:38.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

608
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:43.570
<v Speaker 1>So the one thing is what Jesus was</v>
<v Speaker 1>warning against being religious without</v>

609
00:24:43.671 --> 00:24:44.810
<v Speaker 1>being spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

610
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.820
<v Speaker 1>does some of the religious authorities</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his day when I'm warning against,</v>

611
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.450
<v Speaker 1>is being spiritual without being</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious,</v>

612
00:24:50.451 --> 00:24:54.020
<v Speaker 1>which is much more common today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's not an either or.</v>

613
00:24:54.021 --> 00:24:55.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a both end.</v>

614
00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:03.240
<v Speaker 1>The worst career advice I've ever had</v>
<v Speaker 1>was when I was at the Wharton School,</v>

615
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>studying business.</v>

616
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:05.663
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

617
00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I went to my faculty advisor and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

618
00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wharton students are supposed to be</v>

619
00:25:11.431 --> 00:25:15.300
<v Speaker 1>focused really on the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said that I would be interested in</v>

620
00:25:15.301 --> 00:25:18.840
<v Speaker 1>taking an American poetry class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said that the stupidest thing</v>

621
00:25:18.841 --> 00:25:20.400
<v Speaker 1>I've ever heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

622
00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.130
<v Speaker 1>don't take an American poetry class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a waste of time.</v>

623
00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:27.630
<v Speaker 1>No one will care if you ever studied</v>
<v Speaker 1>American poetry when you want to get a</v>

624
00:25:27.631 --> 00:25:31.020
<v Speaker 1>job at ge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would strongly advise you not to do</v>

625
00:25:31.021 --> 00:25:33.150
<v Speaker 1>that unless you want to be thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

626
00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not serious about your job.</v>

627
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.240
<v Speaker 1>So fortunately I didn't take his advice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's one of the few courses I</v>

628
00:25:39.241 --> 00:25:42.030
<v Speaker 1>remember very well from school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

629
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.680
<v Speaker 1>the best career advice I've ever gotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>was from that psychologist who said,</v>

630
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:47.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you do if you could do</v>

631
00:25:47.821 --> 00:25:48.750
<v Speaker 1>anything you wanted to do?</v>

632
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.050
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a question I ask a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and it's very clarifying for</v>

633
00:25:52.051 --> 00:25:56.760
<v Speaker 1>people because frequently have these</v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations put on us by family,</v>

634
00:25:56.761 --> 00:25:58.500
<v Speaker 1>by friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what you should do.</v>

635
00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.830
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine called that a shooting</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over yourself.</v>

636
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.410
<v Speaker 1>S h o u.</v>
<v Speaker 1>L.</v>

637
00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:04.410
<v Speaker 1>D.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

638
00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:04.410
<v Speaker 1>N.</v>
<v Speaker 1>G.</v>

639
00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than saying,</v>

640
00:26:05.581 --> 00:26:06.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are my desires?</v>

641
00:26:06.571 --> 00:26:08.700
<v Speaker 1>What do I like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What gets me excited?</v>

642
00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I tend to think that,</v>

643
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:14.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will do better at things that you're</v>

644
00:26:14.821 --> 00:26:17.310
<v Speaker 1>really interested in because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to spend more time with that.</v>

645
00:26:17.311 --> 00:26:20.700
<v Speaker 1>You're going to read about it outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>work and you'll be enthusiastic about</v>

646
00:26:20.701 --> 00:26:22.410
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I was at,</v>

647
00:26:22.411 --> 00:26:23.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Ge,</v>

648
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working in business,</v>

649
00:26:25.171 --> 00:26:27.270
<v Speaker 1>I realized that the people who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do well,</v>

650
00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.980
<v Speaker 1>where the people who loved it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

651
00:26:28.981 --> 00:26:31.020
<v Speaker 1>my friends would read the Wall Street</v>
<v Speaker 1>Journal and say,</v>

652
00:26:31.021 --> 00:26:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fascinating.</v>

653
00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.140
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you read that stuff?</v>

654
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.771
<v Speaker 1>You can say it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

655
00:26:34.771 --> 00:26:36.510
<v Speaker 1>this is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you not read it?</v>

656
00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:38.830
<v Speaker 1>And so this notion of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

657
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.220
<v Speaker 1>following your desires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is really important.</v>

658
00:26:41.221 --> 00:26:41.701
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

659
00:26:41.701 --> 00:26:44.610
<v Speaker 1>what would you do if you could do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything you wanted to do is probably</v>

660
00:26:44.611 --> 00:26:48.000
<v Speaker 1>the best career advice or the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>question I've ever been asked about my</v>

661
00:26:48.001 --> 00:26:48.420
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>
