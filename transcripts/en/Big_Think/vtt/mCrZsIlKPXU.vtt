<v Speaker 1>Sebastian copeland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I a photographer,</v>

2
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.360
<v Speaker 1>a lecturer and an environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>advocate,</v>

3
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>jokingly referring to the age old</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict between England and France.</v>

4
00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:27.424
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.290
<v Speaker 1>and my parents decided to challenge that</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition and we're not very successful</v>

6
00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:33.580
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

7
00:00:33.581 --> 00:00:34.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

8
00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:37.150
<v Speaker 1>my mother's British and my father's</v>
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>

9
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.980
<v Speaker 1>they separated and fairly early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but luckily they've remained friends.</v>

11
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.900
<v Speaker 1>It was dysfunctional at first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

12
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:48.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's challenging at times for a child,</v>

13
00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I think to be a bicultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.090
<v Speaker 1>but it pays off in spades later on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

15
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.770
<v Speaker 1>And so it has given me some tools to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with a,</v>

16
00:00:56.771 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 1>with a variety and discrepancies between</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures and,</v>

17
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.340
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.710
<v Speaker 1>and as it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I consider myself to be,</v>

19
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:06.510
<v Speaker 1>try cultural because I've lived in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America for a,</v>

20
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>an excessive 25 years with nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:13.250
<v Speaker 1>25 years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just,</v>

22
00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:15.230
<v Speaker 1>it's great to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

23
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm bilingual and helps and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 1>then try cultural in the sense that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can navigate between these different</v>

25
00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:24.890
<v Speaker 1>countries and feel I'm either not</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely at home,</v>

26
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:26.780
<v Speaker 1>but certainly not completely a foreign</v>
<v Speaker 1>island.</v>

27
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.030
<v Speaker 1>My father is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

28
00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:31.700
<v Speaker 1>is a classical conductor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

29
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:36.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a long family lineage in that,</v>

30
00:01:36.051 --> 00:01:38.600
<v Speaker 1>a discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My great uncle was a,</v>

31
00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:41.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a very famous pianist who was</v>

32
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Toscanini's favorite pianist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was brought up in,</v>

33
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:48.860
<v Speaker 1>in an environment of classical music</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

34
00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which translated later on in jazz.</v>

35
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:53.390
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through my rebellious stage,</v>

36
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:55.490
<v Speaker 1>I translated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.140
<v Speaker 1>not surprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

38
00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:58.640
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in punk rock.</v>

39
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.110
<v Speaker 1>So I had a sort of a fairly broad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a range of,</v>

40
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>musical exposure and a,</v>

41
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.980
<v Speaker 1>until this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I consider music to come any into two</v>

42
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:11.170
<v Speaker 1>jars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is</v>

43
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.570
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
