00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the political philosophers</v>
<v Speaker 1>have any,</v>

2
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>have any special insight into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.050
<v Speaker 1>into everyday politics as I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I suggested before,</v>

4
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>most political philosophers are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in philosophy than in</v>

5
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that doesn't give them any,</v>

6
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any handle on what's going on in the</v>

7
00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my experience in the academic world</v>

8
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:37.050
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that academics are not much more</v>

9
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>intelligent about everyday issues then</v>
<v Speaker 1>than ordinary citizens.</v>

10
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are more knowledgeable.</v>

11
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:47.820
<v Speaker 1>They can call up historical references,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean they get things</v>

12
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>right here and hearing now.</v>

13
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Hose John Edwards was the candidate most</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed to an organized campaign to</v>

14
00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 1>reduce any qualities in American</v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.060
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't get very far this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.770
<v Speaker 1>this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

17
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.590
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

18
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose I,</v>

19
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I think that Hillary Clinton is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>is of the remaining to the most like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>European social democratic politician,</v>

21
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.560
<v Speaker 1>a policy wonky with a lot of ideas about</v>
<v Speaker 1>concretely what ought to be done.</v>

22
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with all the compromises that social</v>

23
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.600
<v Speaker 1>democratic politicians always ended up</v>
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>

24
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Obama is,</v>

25
00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:45.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is from my perspective,</v>

26
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.380
<v Speaker 1>a relatively unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>

28
00:01:50.661 --> 00:01:51.620
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.910
<v Speaker 1>I suppose he is a centrist Democrat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

30
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.660
<v Speaker 1>any Democrat centrist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right or left is going to,</v>

31
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to change the way America has</v>

32
00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:08.681
<v Speaker 1>been moving in the last eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe in the last 40 years.</v>

33
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how,</v>

34
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.490
<v Speaker 1>how committed he is to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he's committed to the rhetoric of</v>

35
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:19.610
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how committed he is to actual</v>

36
00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:24.611
<v Speaker 1>concrete change on the ground and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>prepared he is to fight the necessary</v>

37
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:28.400
<v Speaker 1>fights which will be very partisan and</v>
<v Speaker 1>very ugly in.</v>

38
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:33.401
<v Speaker 1>Won't permit him to ride above partisan</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict the way he has been doing in</v>

39
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:35.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the campaign.</v>

40
00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:37.040
<v Speaker 1>How prepared he is for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

41
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
