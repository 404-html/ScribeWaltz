00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his epitaph may very well be.</v>

2
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.220
<v Speaker 1>He went for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.220
<v Speaker 1>mind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went for something completely</v>

5
00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>different than he said he was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go for.</v>

6
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone seems to have forgotten that</v>

7
00:00:22.661 --> 00:00:25.450
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole decrying of nation building.</v>

8
00:00:25.451 --> 00:00:29.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird that everyone just sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgot that that nine slash 11,</v>

9
00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:31.990
<v Speaker 1>as terrible as it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would completely switch around your</v>

10
00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:34.060
<v Speaker 1>philosophical underpinnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

11
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really make sense to me,</v>

12
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

13
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.210
<v Speaker 1>so I wouldn't go so far as to say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Bush definitely has a core and</v>

14
00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:45.370
<v Speaker 1>knows who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>
