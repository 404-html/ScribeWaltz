00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.460
<v Speaker 1>I must say I've come to it very much as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a human rights issue because when I've</v>

2
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>been in African countries doing my</v>
<v Speaker 1>current work on health,</v>

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.950
<v Speaker 1>on decent work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on women's leadership,</v>

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>people would sort of change the subjects</v>
<v Speaker 1>they but what can we do?</v>

5
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:17.490
<v Speaker 1>We've no seasons anymore and our farming</v>
<v Speaker 1>is destroyed.</v>

6
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Farmers don't have winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's undermining everything and then</v>

7
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:26.031
<v Speaker 1>I realized that in fact the reality is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that our carbon based lifestyles</v>

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>creating these greenhouse gas emissions</v>
<v Speaker 1>are already affecting the poorest and in</v>

9
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 1>a way I think that's not the way we hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>about climate change.</v>

10
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.110
<v Speaker 1>We hear it from scientists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentalist and economists and they</v>

11
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>have important things to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're talking statistics and a</v>

12
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:48.100
<v Speaker 1>polar bear on a melting ice floe and</v>
<v Speaker 1>glaciers melting people's earlier</v>

13
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>started going to be a problem in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future for many,</v>

14
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:51.390
<v Speaker 1>many poor people.</v>

15
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem now and it's undermining</v>
<v Speaker 1>their poor life chances and it could</v>

16
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>lead to conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have water stress,</v>

17
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>when you have people migrating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they estimate that by 2050 we could have</v>

18
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>more than $200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million environmental climate change.</v>

19
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Migrants who've had to move either</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the countries are very often</v>

20
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>across borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of them will want to come to</v>

21
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to come from,</v>

22
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South America more to the United States</v>

23
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.330
<v Speaker 1>if they find arid conditions where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't continue to where they live,</v>

24
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>other flooded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these are unfortunately the threats.</v>

25
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>So we need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

26
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>a developmental approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need,</v>

27
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ensure that we mitigate our own</v>

28
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>carbon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can all do more about that,</v>

29
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>including me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I travel on airplanes a lot.</v>

30
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think how to video more</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to be able to be more energy</v>

31
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 1>efficient in our home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

32
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.420
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.390
<v Speaker 1>also we need to help countries that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in poor parts of the world where they</v>

34
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:52.160
<v Speaker 1>suffer much more from any slight change</v>
<v Speaker 1>in climbers.</v>

35
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>They have no insurance and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>devastated.</v>

36
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Look at what's happening in Pakistan at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment.</v>
