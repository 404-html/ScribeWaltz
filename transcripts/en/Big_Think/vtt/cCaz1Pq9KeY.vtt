1
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.930
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly neat.</v>

2
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.190
<v Speaker 1>It's both the head of state and the head</v>
<v Speaker 1>of government.</v>

3
00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:14.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty rare.</v>

4
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the head of the government,</v>

5
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 2>the head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the head of government,</v>

6
00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:21.891
<v Speaker 2>we expect to fulfill a litany of duties</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we get in there and do a,</v>

7
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:23.791
<v Speaker 2>b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>c,</v>

8
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 2>d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>e,</v>

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.620
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

10
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 2>how to stay is special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The head of state is,</v>

11
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is ideally a reflection of our better</v>

12
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 2>selves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A heightened version of the common man</v>

13
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 2>or a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This person that kind of embodies all</v>

14
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 2>that America should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

15
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 2>to George Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to his credit,</v>

16
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:48.381
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't stint on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on who he is.</v>

17
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he puts it out there to be embraced or</v>

18
00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 2>rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

19
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:55.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

20
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.650
<v Speaker 2>and that's what's so weird is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the Bush administration,</v>

21
00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:03.850
<v Speaker 2>this is a side point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

22
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

23
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.110
<v Speaker 2>The Bush administration is visionary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

24
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:13.760
<v Speaker 2>no one can ever claim that there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything incremental about this</v>

25
00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 2>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

26
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.730
<v Speaker 2>it's been a visionary administration</v>
<v Speaker 2>with terrible eyesight.</v>
