00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I think the fact that there can be this</v>
<v Speaker 1>exponential warping and it has this</v>

2
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.430
<v Speaker 1>really dramatic implications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty important.</v>

3
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.820
<v Speaker 1>It's important for the reason that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just said which is that it might explain</v>

4
00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:20.480
<v Speaker 1>why mass gales are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be relevant for other places</v>

5
00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:23.480
<v Speaker 1>where you'd want different math skills</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as inflationary cosmology,</v>

6
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.920
<v Speaker 1>but we also found something else that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was very interesting that you could</v>

7
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:32.921
<v Speaker 1>actually have an infinite dimension of</v>
<v Speaker 1>space that's an extra dimension of</v>

8
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>fourth measure of space that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>see and this was really radical in a</v>

9
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:40.940
<v Speaker 1>sense that since the basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>physicists always thought that if you</v>

10
00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>head extra dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to be tiny because we don't see</v>

11
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:44.960
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty intuitive.</v>

12
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.820
<v Speaker 1>If something's really small you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it,</v>

13
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.020
<v Speaker 1>and so the idea that you had very curled</v>
<v Speaker 1>up or finite sized extra dimensions and</v>

14
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:54.290
<v Speaker 1>that was basically what people thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>was essential for us not to see them.</v>

15
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.150
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that this strong warping</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we discovered could also mean that</v>

16
00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:02.690
<v Speaker 1>gravity is so concentrated that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't see it an extra dimension of</v>

17
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:05.300
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that could have radical implications.</v>

18
00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Obviously for it.</v>
