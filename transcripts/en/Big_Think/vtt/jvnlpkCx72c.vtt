1
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I guess my personal philosophy</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost always has to do with,</v>

2
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.770
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the most important way with the need</v>

3
00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:26.771
<v Speaker 1>that I feel everyone has for an artistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>element in their lives and it doesn't</v>

4
00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:31.450
<v Speaker 1>matter what their profession or their</v>
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>

5
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.390
<v Speaker 1>I think that I heard once that everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in the world has written a</v>

6
00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:39.680
<v Speaker 1>poem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether that's true,</v>

7
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>but it should be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must,</v>

8
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:44.210
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be true because I don't think</v>

9
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:49.211
<v Speaker 1>anyone lacks what we would call an</v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic impulse and what I feel more</v>

10
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.650
<v Speaker 1>than sort of political causes that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be interested in.</v>

11
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cause that I would embrace is the</v>

12
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:04.031
<v Speaker 1>idea that people might be encouraged to</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience even for a few moments in a</v>

13
00:01:07.941 --> 00:01:10.250
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that,</v>

14
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the imagination is ruling their,</v>

15
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.700
<v Speaker 1>their life for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.780
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be my prime cause in spite of</v>

17
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:21.700
<v Speaker 1>the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.640
<v Speaker 1>I have occasionally I have written</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces with very frankly political</v>

19
00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:28.010
<v Speaker 1>subjects and I've spent moments in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

20
00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:29.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

21
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:30.380
<v Speaker 1>64.</v>

22
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.580
<v Speaker 1>I went with all of the freedom summer</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks to Mississippi and with a group</v>

23
00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:35.630
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from here,</v>

24
00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:39.740
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we definitely experienced an amazing</v>

25
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker 1>moment in the politics of this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I've addressed things like that</v>

26
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.770
<v Speaker 1>in my music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been much more because it's part of</v>

27
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.700
<v Speaker 1>a whole emotional complex for myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that I want to convert we're or</v>

28
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.600
<v Speaker 1>influence opinion because unfortunately</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience for such a piece usually</v>

29
00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:08.150
<v Speaker 1>agrees</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>

30
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:10.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if one were really to be serious about</v>

31
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 1>the prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about moving people through the arts</v>

32
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.150
<v Speaker 1>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to almost find a,</v>

33
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.200
<v Speaker 1>select your way into an audience that</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't like what you're saying,</v>

34
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And very seldom of course,</v>

35
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:24.234
<v Speaker 1>do we ever do that?</v>

36
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably the hardest thing for me</v>

37
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:34.341
<v Speaker 1>to articulate because most of my life as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a performer deals with forms of</v>

38
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:36.850
<v Speaker 1>religious music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

39
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.380
<v Speaker 1>and I certainly feel that when I conduct</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Bach Cantata that I am a absolutely</v>

40
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.660
<v Speaker 1>engaged by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in an abstract way at all by the</v>

41
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:54.840
<v Speaker 1>issues and by the stories and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

42
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't,</v>

43
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>I can't find a formal structure for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

44
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I write a religious text,</v>

45
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:14.371
<v Speaker 1>I would have to say that I am as gripped</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the ancient and the sound of the</v>

46
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:22.200
<v Speaker 1>words and the feeling that they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying significance,</v>

47
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>a almost that has been a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>gradually attached to them.</v>

48
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm over centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

49
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.320
<v Speaker 1>I would like to feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all of the assertions were things I</v>

50
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>can assert and that's not really how I</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel.</v>

51
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.610
<v Speaker 1>But the King James Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've come back to so often for texts and</v>

52
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really translated at a moment</v>

53
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 1>where the English language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had an extraordinary rhythmic and</v>

54
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 1>verbal variety.</v>

55
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>It's Shakespeare's era and I find</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the passage,</v>

56
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>this passage that attracts me has</v>
<v Speaker 1>unusual words or rhythms that I just</v>

57
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:09.780
<v Speaker 1>find absolutely irresistible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

58
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 1>in addition to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it's,</v>

59
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.430
<v Speaker 1>it's accumulated significance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's as much just a,</v>

60
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 1>a deep affection for a text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a love for a text as it is the whole</v>

61
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 1>world of doctrine from which it merges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

62
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of people who are dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with church music.</v>

63
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>And actually work as a church musician</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the time,</v>

64
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.420
<v Speaker 1>it's terribly unsettling to have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>contemplate how much of the conflict in</v>

65
00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>the world to this day is generated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious groups,</v>

66
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.450
<v Speaker 1>by people who are fired up about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrine.</v>

67
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.890
<v Speaker 1>And it's difficult for someone like</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself to embrace the institutional</v>

68
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:06.340
<v Speaker 1>issues having from a semi historian's</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view,</v>

69
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>a pretty firm idea that they often lead</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people fighting each other about it.</v>

70
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.620
<v Speaker 1>The hardest things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 1>compassion and forgiveness and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerance,</v>

72
00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:29.580
<v Speaker 1>which is also a really a hard one</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

73
00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:30.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those,</v>

74
00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:33.300
<v Speaker 1>some of the major issues in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

75
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>race.</v>

76
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.030
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

77
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to even say a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual tolerance.</v>

78
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:46.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm very bothered that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

79
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.150
<v Speaker 1>many groups in this country are</v>
<v Speaker 1>dismissive of other groups because they</v>

80
00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:53.640
<v Speaker 1>feel they're not as cultured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as educated.</v>

81
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 1>I think we have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tremendous attraction to</v>

82
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:05.171
<v Speaker 1>intolerance almost bred into the early</v>
<v Speaker 1>life of this country.</v>

83
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.073
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

84
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would consider those,</v>

85
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>my</v>
<v Speaker 1>major virtues.</v>

86
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:12.350
<v Speaker 1>And also it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:17.351
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>to apologize for things and I'm always</v>

88
00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:21.610
<v Speaker 1>impressed by people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

89
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 1>when they've done something really</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

90
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.210
<v Speaker 1>don't do the standard thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to make it worse and</v>

91
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.640
<v Speaker 1>ostracized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually go the whole way and try to</v>

92
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.290
<v Speaker 1>reengage the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

93
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 1>and in our profession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our music profession,</v>

94
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.170
<v Speaker 1>there are constant tests of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.540
<v Speaker 1>of those issues.</v>
