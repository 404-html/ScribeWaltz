00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Being a standup comedian is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardest jobs in the entertainment</v>

2
00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:10.900
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not the hardest job in the</v>

3
00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:14.380
<v Speaker 1>entertainment industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it takes a special skill and a</v>

4
00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:18.430
<v Speaker 1>special talent to be able to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be up there on a stage,</v>

5
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 1>just you and a microphone and a stool</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be able to be so open and</v>

6
00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:26.494
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable,</v>

7
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear stories.</v>

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm comedians are more depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have more substance abuse,</v>

9
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:37.150
<v Speaker 1>they have more of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of that and you know,</v>

10
00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:38.830
<v Speaker 1>they're just a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really troubled</v>

11
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.200
<v Speaker 1>population and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think they're more</v>

12
00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:48.310
<v Speaker 1>trouble than anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lifestyle of a standup comedian</v>

13
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.830
<v Speaker 1>breeds the depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.740
<v Speaker 1>or it can exacerbate something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>preexisting,</v>

15
00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:58.270
<v Speaker 1>like a bipolar disorder or substance</v>
<v Speaker 1>abuse because what happens is that they</v>

16
00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:03.271
<v Speaker 1>are out on the road and they are by</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and they're traveling</v>

17
00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:08.281
<v Speaker 1>sometimes to these areas that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>very popular and aren't very pretty and</v>

18
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.750
<v Speaker 1>working in these dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dank clubs and then going back to a</v>

19
00:01:13.751 --> 00:01:14.590
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dank</v>

20
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.850
<v Speaker 1>hotel room and it gets very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very lonely.</v>

21
00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:23.650
<v Speaker 1>They don't have their support system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have much of anything.</v>

22
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.170
<v Speaker 1>They're there by themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you're bored,</v>

23
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertain yourself with like alcohol or</v>

24
00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:31.000
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

25
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:34.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when the problems start to</v>

26
00:01:34.151 --> 00:01:37.390
<v Speaker 1>persist and then it goes on and on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>on from there.</v>

27
00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until they get treatment,</v>

28
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.740
<v Speaker 1>comedians do see comedy as a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>self treatment.</v>

29
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.590
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times they think of it as their</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy.</v>

30
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.010
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that being onstage and performing and</v>

31
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:54.170
<v Speaker 1>doing your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your standup a,</v>

32
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:56.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is definitely therapeutic,</v>

33
00:01:56.721 --> 00:02:01.721
<v Speaker 1>but it is not therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is that a thought that</v>

34
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.520
<v Speaker 1>if you are successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you make more money,</v>

35
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 1>if you are admired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.360
<v Speaker 1>if you're recognized out on the street</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all your problems are going to go</v>

37
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:17.090
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not true.</v>

38
00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:18.980
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we saw with Robin Williams,</v>

39
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.540
<v Speaker 1>his problems did not go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

40
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>your problems just become different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>they become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.790
<v Speaker 1>different levels of stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different levels of depression,</v>

43
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.020
<v Speaker 1>and it's across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't deal with your mental</v>

44
00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:34.210
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.530
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to go away.</v>

46
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.950
<v Speaker 1>There is a stigma across the board still</v>
<v Speaker 1>with mental health.</v>

47
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think that,</v>

48
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't solve our own problems and if</v>

49
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:50.850
<v Speaker 1>we go seek help by talking to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapist,</v>

50
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:52.250
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist,</v>

51
00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:56.510
<v Speaker 1>any other mental health worker that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a problem with us that there</v>

52
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.760
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were crazy or something like that.</v>

53
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>So I think we'll end can be a useful</v>
<v Speaker 1>resource in terms of,</v>

54
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching the world about mental health</v>

55
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:15.901
<v Speaker 1>issues when you come out publicly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with any sort of issue on a certain</v>

56
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:19.130
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 1>and talk about it as if it is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that is not stigmatized,</v>

58
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>then we won't look at it as something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is bad or evil.</v>

59
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>I think what we need to start doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>really looking at mental health as any</v>

60
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>other medical condition that we all</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

61
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a pain in our knee,</v>

62
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 1>pain in our back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have diabetes,</v>

63
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>we have a heart condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go to a doctor or take medication,</v>

64
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 1>eat right exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do what we need to do,</v>

65
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.780
<v Speaker 1>follow through with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

66
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 1>and we start getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>

67
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the same thing with mental</v>

68
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>
