00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Aesthetic evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals are agents in their own</v>

2
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is it through their choices,</v>

3
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.040
<v Speaker 1>they ended up shaping their own species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the implications of this idea is</v>

4
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:24.591
<v Speaker 1>a new perspective on what happens when</v>
<v Speaker 1>mate choice is infringed or violated by</v>

5
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>sexual violence or by a coercion in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.600
<v Speaker 1>in animal species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

7
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 1>one prominent example of this from our</v>
<v Speaker 1>own research is on duck sex.</v>

8
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.420
<v Speaker 1>A ducks are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unusual among birds in having both a,</v>

10
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.520
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

11
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.220
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

12
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.220
<v Speaker 1>a typical mate choice situation where</v>
<v Speaker 1>male and females pair up on the basis of</v>

13
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>display and preferences and</v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously other individuals that</v>

14
00:00:55.051 --> 00:01:00.051
<v Speaker 1>forced copulations on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a female docs as the approach</v>

15
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that,</v>

16
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the eggs were being laid,</v>

17
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:10.821
<v Speaker 1>females have to defend themselves from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>forced copulations by males.</v>

18
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forced population is the word that</v>

19
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 1>biologists use now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but force over a century.</v>

20
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>A biologist used the word rape in</v>
<v Speaker 1>biology.</v>

21
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Now that was abandoned back in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies in response to the feminist</v>

22
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Susan Brown Miller and her work a</v>

23
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.110
<v Speaker 1>against our will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.190
<v Speaker 1>proposing and articulating a</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically a social context for a rape</v>

25
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.660
<v Speaker 1>in humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This led to the creation of a euphemism</v>

26
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>forced copulation in biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

27
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>articulating a sexual violence in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal world with these euphemistic</v>

28
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:58.701
<v Speaker 1>terms has led to scientists losing track</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fact that forced copulation is</v>

29
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 1>against the will of the ducks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by taking the aesthetic perspective</v>

30
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>and trying to understand what it is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual females in this case,</v>

31
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 1>stocks want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

32
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>we have arrived at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new perspective on what it means when</v>

33
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 1>they don't get what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

34
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.490
<v Speaker 1>So in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using,</v>

36
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially sensitive euphemisms has led to</v>

37
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.370
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a precision or fuzziness in,</v>

38
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.290
<v Speaker 1>in the science.</v>

39
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>In the case of ducks x.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we find is that males can force</v>

40
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:39.090
<v Speaker 1>themselves on females because they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>among the few birds that still have a</v>

41
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>penis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

42
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.410
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we find in docs is the,</v>

44
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.250
<v Speaker 1>as a result of a female resistance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>male sexual violence,</v>

45
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.880
<v Speaker 1>we find a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

46
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>a coevolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a arms race between male,</v>

47
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>a capacity to force and female</v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance.</v>

48
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes place in the form of a genital</v>

49
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>arms race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The males evolve,</v>

50
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>a more elaborate and more elaborately</v>
<v Speaker 1>armed penises.</v>

51
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>And the females evolve convoluted</v>
<v Speaker 1>vaginal morphologies that exclude the</v>

52
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>penis during forced copulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

53
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among the many weird things that a duck</v>

54
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.090
<v Speaker 1>penis is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they're counterclockwise,</v>

55
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>coiled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the female,</v>

57
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 1>a vagina in ducks that have a high rates</v>
<v Speaker 1>of resistance actually coils in the</v>

58
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.480
<v Speaker 1>opposite direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have literally evolved in it</v>

59
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.250
<v Speaker 1>screwed device,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>in their vaginal track that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ubs a,</v>

61
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 1>obstructs the intermission of the penis</v>
<v Speaker 1>during forced copulation.</v>

62
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means is that the,</v>

63
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that tea party,</v>

64
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Senator Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Todd Akin from Missouri said,</v>

65
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

66
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women have a way of shutting that whole</v>

67
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 1>thing down in reference to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to rape is actually true of ducks.</v>

68
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 1>But in a way that exposes something</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally new and interesting about</v>

69
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that sexual autonomy matters to</v>

70
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freedom of choice is not merely a</v>

71
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:14.461
<v Speaker 1>political concept in discovered by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffragettes and feminists in the 19th</v>

72
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 1>and 20th centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually an evolved feature of</v>

73
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 1>the social and sexual lives of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>species,</v>

74
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 1>especially in docs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does this work?</v>

75
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the female mates with the male she</v>

76
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:30.310
<v Speaker 1>prefers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is she gets the green had in the</v>

77
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:30.821
<v Speaker 1>quack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quack,</v>

78
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:34.270
<v Speaker 1>quack that she likes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then her male offspring will share</v>

79
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 1>that those traits and be sexually</v>
<v Speaker 1>preferred by other female docs who have</v>

80
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 1>coevolved those same aesthetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>preferences.</v>

81
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 1>But if she's forcibly fertilized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then her male offspring will either</v>

82
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 1>inherit a random trade or one that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically rejected,</v>

83
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 1>which means that her offspring will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>less attractive to other females.</v>

84
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>So anything that female duck can do to</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent force fertilization through</v>

85
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:04.291
<v Speaker 1>physical resistance or behavior will</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolve because she will be rewarded with</v>

86
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>more grandkids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

87
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 1>So what this means is that a aesthetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>norms,</v>

88
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>these shared ideas about what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful among ducks gives female ducks</v>

89
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.910
<v Speaker 1>the evolutionary leverage to advance</v>
<v Speaker 1>their freedom of choice in the</v>

90
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>environment of persistent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sexual coercion and sexual violence,</v>

91
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

92
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.680
<v Speaker 1>this is really stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

93
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:34.681
<v Speaker 1>we know these ducks are so successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in species were 40 or 50 percent</v>

94
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:40.231
<v Speaker 1>of the populations are forced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only two to five percent of the eggs in</v>

95
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:45.160
<v Speaker 1>the nest are fathered by males who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the social partner.</v>

96
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>What that means is that females have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>98 percent a successful,</v>

97
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>birth control device.</v>

98
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.230
<v Speaker 1>That is a behavior of Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deployable in the vaginal tract in</v>

99
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 1>response to sexual violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

100
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 1>That's like FDA approvable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

101
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.590
<v Speaker 1>And what that shows is the power of</v>
<v Speaker 1>female choice to advance,</v>

102
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sexual autonomy of individual</v>

103
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>females.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the interesting things we learned</v>

104
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

105
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 1>examining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

106
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual conflict in docs is that,</v>

107
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the genital arms race between males and</v>

108
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 1>females is not really a fair fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

109
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the advances in feet in male coercive</v>

110
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.960
<v Speaker 1>capacity are really about control over a</v>
<v Speaker 1>female outcomes,</v>

111
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are about controlling,</v>

112
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:46.940
<v Speaker 1>physically controlling a fertilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

113
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:51.941
<v Speaker 1>the countermeasures that females evolve</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not actually about power or control.</v>

114
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.750
<v Speaker 1>They merely reestablish a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

115
00:06:55.751 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

116
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.030
<v Speaker 1>the freedom of choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>

117
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 1>the flat playing field in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals are free to choose who they</v>

118
00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 1>like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

119
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.150
<v Speaker 1>this sexual autonomy is not actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a control or control over other</v>

120
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 1>people's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

121
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.610
<v Speaker 1>or over other individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

122
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:17.444
<v Speaker 1>sexual outcomes.</v>

123
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.560
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating because this is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cemetery between,</v>

124
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a male,</v>

125
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.460
<v Speaker 1>male coercion and female resistance in</v>
<v Speaker 1>duck sex,</v>

126
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has really fascinating parallels to a,</v>

127
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a patriarchy and feminism in cultures</v>

128
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:36.200
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

129
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.180
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a patriarchy is historically and even in</v>

130
00:07:40.181 --> 00:07:43.640
<v Speaker 1>a modern sense about coercive control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

131
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.810
<v Speaker 1>over female reproductive autonomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

132
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.940
<v Speaker 1>whereas feminism is a really an ideology</v>
<v Speaker 1>of freedom of choice,</v>

133
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's so that same cemetery between</v>

134
00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:56.380
<v Speaker 1>male power and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

135
00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 1>and freedom of choice a is elaborate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>present today.</v>

136
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:05.330
<v Speaker 1>And we can see this explicitly because</v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy and a men's rights,</v>

137
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:09.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in cell a movements all articulate</v>

138
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:14.291
<v Speaker 1>feminism as a countervailing force have</v>
<v Speaker 1>control over a male reproductive</v>

139
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:15.630
<v Speaker 1>outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

140
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.270
<v Speaker 1>but that's a fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

141
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

142
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:24.410
<v Speaker 1>the sexual autonomy includes the freedom</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be rejected at which,</v>

143
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

144
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.900
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

145
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.720
<v Speaker 1>a lesson that we learned from duck sex.</v>
