00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>The reason I put so much time and effort</v>
<v Speaker 1>into creating teslow was,</v>

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

4
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:10.960
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.540
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has always seemed to me that the,</v>

6
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:13.190
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

7
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.190
<v Speaker 1>that transportation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

8
00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:16.960
<v Speaker 1>we'll go electric and should go</v>
<v Speaker 1>electric,</v>

9
00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:19.630
<v Speaker 1>but we have an unpriced externality in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

10
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.240
<v Speaker 1>negative effects of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

11
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.090
<v Speaker 1>of gasoline and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.000
<v Speaker 1>on the environment and also in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:30.260
<v Speaker 1>the wars that we fight and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.050
<v Speaker 1>national security and that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

15
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you have an unpriced</v>
<v Speaker 1>externality,</v>

16
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 1>you can't quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't quite rely on the market to,</v>

17
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:41.590
<v Speaker 1>to do the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in order to have electric vehicles</v>

18
00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:44.470
<v Speaker 1>come sooner than they otherwise would it</v>
<v Speaker 1>electric vehicles,</v>

19
00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:44.740
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

20
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.300
<v Speaker 1>we're always going to be the long term</v>
<v Speaker 1>transportation mechanism.</v>

21
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to make that day come sooner,</v>

22
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to bridge the gap with</v>

23
00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:55.570
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Petrus,</v>

24
00:00:55.571 --> 00:01:00.571
<v Speaker 1>the goal with Tesla is to try to serve</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a catalyst to accelerate the day,</v>

25
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.630
<v Speaker 1>the day of electric vehicles.</v>

27
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.583
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

28
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when all said and done,</v>

30
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm hopeful that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.630
<v Speaker 1>historians will look back on Tesla and</v>
<v Speaker 1>saint a tesla advanced that by,</v>

32
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least 10 years,</v>

33
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.900
<v Speaker 1>which at that that would be a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>victory in my,</v>

34
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.440
<v Speaker 1>in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And solar city of course is on the</v>

35
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.020
<v Speaker 1>assault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is on the energy production side of</v>

36
00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:27.220
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't help if we have</v>

38
00:01:29.351 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>sustainable consumption of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

39
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:34.030
<v Speaker 1>but then that energy isn't produced in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable way.</v>

40
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.820
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel quite strongly that solar power</v>

41
00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:40.150
<v Speaker 1>will be the single largest source of</v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity generation,</v>

42
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the midpoint of the century.</v>

43
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

44
00:01:43.631 --> 00:01:46.190
<v Speaker 1>it just a simple extrapolation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth of solar power would,</v>

45
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:47.680
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would show that that's obviously going</v>

46
00:01:47.681 --> 00:01:50.110
<v Speaker 1>to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also when you consider that the</v>

47
00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:52.060
<v Speaker 1>earth is almost entirely solar powered</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

48
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.010
<v Speaker 1>and that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

49
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.930
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we're not a frozen ice</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball at say four degrees Calvin and,</v>

50
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is just due to the son and the whole</v>

51
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:07.120
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem is powered by the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just an anybody amount of energy</v>

52
00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:10.900
<v Speaker 1>that we need to do complicated human</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

53
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.860
<v Speaker 1>This is a tiny amount of energy really</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to what the son puts on the</v>

54
00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:17.320
<v Speaker 1>earth every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we just need to capture a little bit</v>

55
00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:20.230
<v Speaker 1>of that and turn it into electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

56
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.290
<v Speaker 1>so we have to try to accelerate that</v>
<v Speaker 1>with innovation.</v>

57
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's what soldiers things about.</v>
