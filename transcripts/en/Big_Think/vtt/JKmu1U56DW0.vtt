00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.890
<v Speaker 1>From New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan,</v>

2
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.083
<v Speaker 1>midtown.</v>

3
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up near the United Nations.</v>

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 2>And how has it shaped me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.690
<v Speaker 2>I think it's given me an urban</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensibility,</v>

6
00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:28.880
<v Speaker 2>if you can say such a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

7
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.720
<v Speaker 2>which means that I feel really</v>
<v Speaker 2>disoriented and uncomfortable in the</v>

8
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:39.821
<v Speaker 2>countryside and much more comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cities and m would rather go to a</v>

9
00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:48.131
<v Speaker 2>second or third tier New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I wander out in the wilderness for</v>

10
00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:53.240
<v Speaker 2>a long time because then I would get</v>
<v Speaker 2>scared.</v>

11
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.610
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

12
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of those city people that is</v>

13
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:03.341
<v Speaker 2>comforted by the sounds of the city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like ambulances and a car alarms,</v>

14
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.420
<v Speaker 2>people screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

15
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.390
<v Speaker 2>crazy people screaming in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the night.</v>

16
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.553
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

17
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do love,</v>

18
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.090
<v Speaker 2>I actually do love going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

19
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.660
<v Speaker 2>I spent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to sleep away camp in Maine and</v>

20
00:01:19.661 --> 00:01:21.230
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was really an ideal like time for</v>

21
00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:22.490
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

22
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.370
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I tend to go back and forth between</v>

23
00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:27.580
<v Speaker 2>both extremes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now I'm in there.</v>

24
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 2>pretty scattered often when I'm in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>city in New York.</v>

26
00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:43.244
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

27
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.713
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm,</v>

28
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm constantly moving around and doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

29
00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:53.951
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot more difficult to find time</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think and concentrate and have any</v>

30
00:01:54.741 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Speaker 2>kind of sustained thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

31
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.780
<v Speaker 2>so ideally I guess I'd like to go live</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and live between the city and</v>

32
00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:05.610
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never have really done that.</v>

33
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:07.910
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes went to friend's country</v>

34
00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:10.040
<v Speaker 2>houses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I was growing up,</v>

35
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.700
<v Speaker 2>but I never had one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

36
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.350
<v Speaker 2>but I guess it makes me pretty scattered</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a have a bad memory and prone to</v>

37
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:19.940
<v Speaker 2>speaking and articulately.</v>

38
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>He's a main contributions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the city.</v>

39
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.180
<v Speaker 1>I love living in Brooklyn and</v>

40
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.370
<v Speaker 2>most of my friends were there and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a sense of neighborhood.</v>

41
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.230
<v Speaker 2>I live in Cobble Hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do you see people on the street that</v>

42
00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:43.470
<v Speaker 2>he recognize?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

43
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 2>and don't talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause that would be weird,</v>

44
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.910
<v Speaker 2>but did you recognize them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

45
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:49.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

46
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 2>it has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really like feeling,</v>

47
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being part of a neighborhood with some</v>

48
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 2>history and the part of New York where</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm from in midtown has been,</v>

49
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>torn up and,</v>

50
00:03:03.591 --> 00:03:05.120
<v Speaker 2>and mixed around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

51
00:03:05.121 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 2>and the people who live there are people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who weren't there when I was there when</v>

52
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 2>I grew up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

53
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the buildings have totally changed the</v>

54
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 2>level of magnitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

55
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 2>when we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I grew up,</v>

56
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Speaker 2>it was a lot of buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the neighborhood I live in now,</v>

57
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four story buildings.</v>

58
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 2>And now there are 90 story residential</v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment buildings.</v>

59
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

60
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 2>it's not a friendly place and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a much more comfortable,</v>

61
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.960
<v Speaker 1>uh.</v>
