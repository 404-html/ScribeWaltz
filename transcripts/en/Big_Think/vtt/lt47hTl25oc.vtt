00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.241
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2
00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:11.030
<v Speaker 1>I always love working with which</v>
<v Speaker 1>scorsese because,</v>

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.620
<v Speaker 1>he had the confidence to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike a lot of directors,</v>

5
00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:19.010
<v Speaker 1>he had the confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know exactly what he wanted and he</v>

6
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:19.431
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

7
00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:20.750
<v Speaker 1>you're the writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me this.</v>

8
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.350
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't fret over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just went off and,</v>

9
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set up his shots and,</v>

10
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of trusted me to deliver the</v>

11
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:33.230
<v Speaker 1>goods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys are like so anxious that</v>

12
00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:35.720
<v Speaker 1>they never know what they want and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get caught in the middle.</v>

13
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get into power plays between actors</v>

14
00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:40.630
<v Speaker 1>and directors and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fit,</v>

15
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:40.970
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.130
<v Speaker 1>you feel like a secretary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a dog collar on.</v>

17
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never,</v>

18
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which Scorsese,</v>

19
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:47.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

20
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:51.170
<v Speaker 1>he just knew exactly what he wanted and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:52.760
<v Speaker 1>it was a breeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

22
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>it's never easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was relatively,</v>

23
00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:56.000
<v Speaker 1>it was a breeze.</v>

24
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Other people I worked with that I really</v>
<v Speaker 1>liked is a David Simon and,</v>

25
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.770
<v Speaker 1>and the crew around the wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

26
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 1>the only reason to do that show other</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you sure don't do it for the money.</v>

27
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:09.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you open up the envelope and um,</v>

28
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moths fly out.</v>

29
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.083
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

30
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 1>you do it cause it's the wire and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

31
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.140
<v Speaker 1>it seemed like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a group of peers,</v>

32
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.550
<v Speaker 1>although it wasn't cause Simon was to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create her,</v>

33
00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:20.810
<v Speaker 1>he and Ed Burns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:21.371
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

35
00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>they were the writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>producer,</v>

36
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.110
<v Speaker 1>creator is always the guy that rewrites</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and is in control.</v>

37
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.530
<v Speaker 1>But given that there was none of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Games,</v>

38
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was me and Pelicano Pelecanos and</v>

39
00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Lehane and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Ed Burns and David Simon.</v>

40
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.120
<v Speaker 1>And I felt like when we were all</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

41
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

42
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.060
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sobriety,</v>

43
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of purpose,</v>

44
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

45
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.080
<v Speaker 1>and a mutual sympathy and respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 1>for each other's work that I rarely find</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

47
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

48
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.320
<v Speaker 1>in group situations like movie making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was just a great show.</v>

49
00:01:58.321 --> 00:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I frankly,</v>

50
00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:01.700
<v Speaker 1>it was so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even understand my own scripts</v>

51
00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:02.840
<v Speaker 1>most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

52
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

53
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did what I was told,</v>

54
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then some.</v>

55
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.550
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.710
<v Speaker 1>I was just really proud to be part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

57
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.270
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
