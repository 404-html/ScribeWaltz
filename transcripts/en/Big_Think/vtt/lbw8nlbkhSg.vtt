1
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.120
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do tell parents this has just</v>

2
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:08.400
<v Speaker 1>figure out what it is that their kid is</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in.</v>

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also what are the kinds of things</v>

4
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:14.850
<v Speaker 1>that they may be struggling with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if there's a child that is,</v>

5
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:18.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm struggling with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 1>a certain way of conceiving of complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

7
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>So maybe they're struggling in math a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

8
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.660
<v Speaker 1>There is a lot of different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>games that give kids practice in a</v>

9
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>ordering certain kinds of problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>working through kinds of certain</v>

10
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.920
<v Speaker 1>sequences of logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a kid that has a passion</v>

11
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>around sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sports Games are a great opportunity for</v>

12
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 1>them to get in there and play with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

13
00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 1>but also gained some facility around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

14
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it mostly has to do with trying</v>

15
00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>to match an interest that their child</v>
<v Speaker 1>might have with,</v>

16
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one a game might be offering,</v>

17
00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>not just in terms of content but also in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the type of game.</v>

18
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a kid that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

19
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>really interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll go back to the math and</v>

20
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole genre of games about</v>

21
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:10.770
<v Speaker 1>building stuff that might be a great job</v>
<v Speaker 1>of game for that kid.</v>

22
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there may be a kid that's really</v>

23
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 1>interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very detail oriented type a personality</v>

24
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:20.790
<v Speaker 1>kid a real time strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Games are a great genera of games for</v>

25
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>those kids and those are games where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are managing complex sets of resources</v>

26
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>in a simulation environment and try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>advance toward a particular kind of</v>

27
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you have a kid that's really</v>

28
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 1>creative and interested in more open</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended kind of exploration.</v>

29
00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:35.910
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole genre of adventure</v>
<v Speaker 1>games,</v>

30
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be really good for that</v>

31
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>particular kind of child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>so just really has to do with what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation is.</v>

33
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important thing we know from a</v>

34
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>learning perspective is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>

35
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.370
<v Speaker 1>So kids that grow up in households where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have an opportunity to talk</v>

36
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>with parents about what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.830
<v Speaker 1>the kids tend to struggle in many ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they haven't again,</v>

38
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.960
<v Speaker 1>been given the opportunity to practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the language,</v>

39
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.650
<v Speaker 1>with using words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with putting together a complex ideas</v>

40
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.950
<v Speaker 1>with creating arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

41
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>the simplest and biggest thing a parent</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do with a child is sit down and play</v>

42
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play the game with them,</v>

43
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>talked to them about what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prompt them,</v>

44
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 1>ask them questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A kids love it when the parent asks them</v>

45
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:28.110
<v Speaker 1>to show that the kid will show the</v>
<v Speaker 1>parent how to do something.</v>

46
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.521
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

47
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a program at the Institute of play</v>

48
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:36.270
<v Speaker 1>called play force where we bring in kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>from third grade up until college and</v>

49
00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:38.900
<v Speaker 1>they play test games for us and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

50
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>tell us what they think are valuable</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the games and what we found is</v>

51
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 1>with some of the younger kids that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moms started coming in with the kids and</v>

52
00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:48.060
<v Speaker 1>they would sit next to him and start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>

53
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 1>And there was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a radical change in the relationship</v>

54
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.080
<v Speaker 1>between the parents understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what their kids were learning from these</v>

55
00:02:55.081 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>games and be just in the relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>between that parent and child as the</v>

56
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>child became an expert in explaining to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mom what they were doing,</v>

57
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>what they were learning how to play the</v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

58
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's a really powerful role</v>

59
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>that you can put your child in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

60
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>is letting them be the teacher and</v>
<v Speaker 1>letting them share with you what it is</v>

61
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>that they find so interesting about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that they're doing.</v>

62
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>And it has consequences in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their potential for future learning.</v>
