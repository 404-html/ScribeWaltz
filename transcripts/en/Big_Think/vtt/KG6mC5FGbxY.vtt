1
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.480
<v Speaker 1>You liked with monster is a big</v>

2
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.110
<v Speaker 2>that was created by a whole bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>caricaturists.</v>

3
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.150
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting that virtually</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody,</v>

4
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.150
<v Speaker 2>unless they're a professionalist story</v>
<v Speaker 2>and writing about the enlightenment,</v>

5
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.200
<v Speaker 2>anybody throwing out discussions about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the enlightenment,</v>

6
00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:22.750
<v Speaker 2>whether it be Robert Kagan on the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

7
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gee,</v>

8
00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:27.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who on the left Fuko on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

9
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever it is,</v>

10
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sees the enlightenment as an isoline</v>

11
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.890
<v Speaker 2>cold being who is sublimated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

12
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.540
<v Speaker 2>passion to reason who believes that</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason is instrumental and calculating</v>

13
00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:45.310
<v Speaker 2>and a matter of technology who has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>blind faith in progress and thinks that</v>

14
00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.250
<v Speaker 2>the world is inexhaustibly going forth</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the better.</v>

15
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.533
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

16
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.980
<v Speaker 2>what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the features of the</v>

17
00:00:50.981 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment monster?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

18
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.930
<v Speaker 2>those are the crucial ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't actually fit anyone,</v>

19
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.260
<v Speaker 2>which is why I called them the</v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment monster in the book.</v>

20
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Because if you look at the enlightenment</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

21
00:01:03.011 --> 00:01:06.010
<v Speaker 2>and you don't need to be a historian and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to dig into the archives,</v>

22
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 2>all you need to do is read candide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was written in 1759 that is in the</v>

23
00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:14.470
<v Speaker 2>middle of the enlightenment by Voltaire.</v>

24
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.060
<v Speaker 2>You see a critique of this very</v>
<v Speaker 2>simplistic enlightenment attitude from</v>

25
00:01:19.061 --> 00:01:22.450
<v Speaker 2>the heart of the enlightenment itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the enlightenment itself knew</v>

26
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.130
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

27
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.180
<v Speaker 2>progress wasn't necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only thought it was possible.</v>

28
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.230
<v Speaker 2>They knew that other things besides</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason were important.</v>

29
00:01:32.231 --> 00:01:35.260
<v Speaker 2>They spend at least as much time talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the emotions as they did about</v>

30
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

31
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.900
<v Speaker 2>and they weren't interested in reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were icu or because they</v>

32
00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:45.901
<v Speaker 2>were merely technological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because reason was a democratic</v>

33
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.210
<v Speaker 2>instrument against superstition and</v>
<v Speaker 2>authority reason as opposed not to</v>

34
00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:55.150
<v Speaker 2>passion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to somebody intuition,</v>

35
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just as well.</v>

36
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.070
<v Speaker 2>God told me to invade another countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a private intuition and</v>

37
00:02:00.071 --> 00:02:02.350
<v Speaker 2>there's no way that I can explain it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

38
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:03.830
<v Speaker 2>but I just know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

39
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 2>it's one way of not using reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another way of not using reason is,</v>

40
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to simply use rhetoric to simply use</v>

41
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.320
<v Speaker 2>soundbites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play the same sound bites over and over</v>

42
00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:20.350
<v Speaker 2>without looking at an entire speech in</v>
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>

43
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to create superstition and fear.</v>

44
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.400
<v Speaker 2>And the enlightenment was attempting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>use reason,</v>

45
00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:30.070
<v Speaker 2>which is a faculty we all have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can all develop.</v>

46
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we can all debate about,</v>

47
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 2>as I gather you're doing with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>program rather than a appealing to</v>

48
00:02:38.621 --> 00:02:42.640
<v Speaker 2>authority or superstition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all of those,</v>

49
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of his criticism of the</v>

50
00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:47.650
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment occurred within the</v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment itself.</v>

51
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea,</v>

52
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.300
<v Speaker 2>the other feature of the enlightenment</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course is that people think it was</v>

53
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.470
<v Speaker 2>totally irreverent and anti religious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not irreverent.</v>

54
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.020
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most members of the,</v>

55
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.370
<v Speaker 2>there's some who were sheer atheists and</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I even would call irreverent,</v>

56
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 2>lacking a sense of reverence that I do</v>
<v Speaker 2>think is terribly important.</v>

57
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.250
<v Speaker 2>But most of them thought that science</v>
<v Speaker 2>would lead to a greater appreciation of</v>

58
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 2>the glories of creation and gratitude</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the fact that we live in a marvelous</v>

59
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was how they soil science as,</v>

60
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 2>as a contributing to human progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not simply,</v>

61
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 2>although these are important enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>helping to eradicate disease and poverty</v>

62
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:32.224
<v Speaker 2>and prejudice,</v>

63
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.940
<v Speaker 3>but also in creating a sense of wonder</v>
<v Speaker 3>and gratitude</v>

64
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.180
<v Speaker 3>for enlightenment values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I don't,</v>

65
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 2>we think that there's one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that when people</v>

66
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 2>associate something positive with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment,</v>

67
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.130
<v Speaker 2>which unfortunately is rare enough these</v>
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>

68
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talk about tolerance.</v>

69
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 2>Tolerance is fine as far as it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you already believe in something,</v>

70
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's deeply wimpy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

71
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.840
<v Speaker 2>in the sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

72
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.360
<v Speaker 2>you might conceivably get somebody to</v>
<v Speaker 2>refrain from doing something in the name</v>

73
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 2>of tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will have a very hard time getting</v>

74
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 2>them to do anything for something in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>name of tolerance because,</v>

75
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a value that has a lot of</v>

76
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 2>content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead I've asked that we look at</v>

77
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 2>four different enlightenment values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One I named two already,</v>

78
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 2>which is reason the other is reverence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I also discussed.</v>

79
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Third,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we've come to take for granted is</v>

80
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 2>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very easy for</v>

81
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalist to look at American</v>
<v Speaker 2>consumerist culture and we've seen a</v>

82
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 2>terrorist do that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

83
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.420
<v Speaker 2>This is not my idea of the meaning of</v>
<v Speaker 2>life of society that's consumed with,</v>

84
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever dies with the most toys wins as</v>

85
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:02.510
<v Speaker 2>a bumper sticker in the 90s used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

86
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 2>there's something revolting about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a sense of value.</v>

87
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.870
<v Speaker 2>That's not what the enlightenment was</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

88
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.110
<v Speaker 2>about sheer materialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The enlightenment was talking about a</v>

89
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:16.111
<v Speaker 2>right to happiness as distinguished from</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever fee you got stuck with.</v>

90
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 2>I started my chapter on happiness with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book of job,</v>

91
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.030
<v Speaker 2>which may seem like a counter intuitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>place to start.</v>

92
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 2>And I started that way because the book</v>
<v Speaker 2>of job is the most read book of the</v>

93
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 2>Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But until the enlightenment,</v>

94
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.570
<v Speaker 2>everyone who read job read him the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>job's friends did that his job had it</v>

95
00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:43.741
<v Speaker 2>coming okay and they went to crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>lengths to try and construct a story</v>

96
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.380
<v Speaker 2>such that Joe deserve whatever it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he got in the enlightenment,</v>

97
00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:53.500
<v Speaker 2>you suddenly began to have a notion that</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

98
00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 2>actually it would be possible for bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>things to happen to good people and good</v>

99
00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 2>things to happen to bad people.</v>

100
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.020
<v Speaker 2>This is not what God has ordained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is if bad things</v>

101
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 2>happen to good people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world people in the world have a</v>

102
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:14.501
<v Speaker 2>right to step up and try to change them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said before you have that idea if</v>

103
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 2>people were sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you know,</v>

104
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 2>it was probably God's will if people</v>
<v Speaker 2>were poor.</v>

105
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was certainly God's will.</v>

106
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.570
<v Speaker 2>So until you have the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness is not something in a last</v>

107
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:31.010
<v Speaker 2>golden age or something that you might</v>
<v Speaker 2>look forward to in heaven,</v>

108
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 2>but something that if you fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 2>do what you should do,</v>

109
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 2>you have a right to on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Until you have that idea,</v>

110
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.240
<v Speaker 2>you don't get a sense of justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the third enlightenment value.</v>

111
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 2>When the final one is the value of hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very different from optimism.</v>

112
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people in the enlightenment,</v>

113
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.300
<v Speaker 2>we're not sunny.</v>

114
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 2>They knew how bad things could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you read some of these pieces,</v>

115
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 2>you'll be amazed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sounded like they could be written</v>

116
00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:01.400
<v Speaker 2>in the late 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as far as their understanding of</v>

117
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:06.200
<v Speaker 2>just how dark human beings could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they don't believe that human beings</v>

118
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 2>are perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just don't believe that they're</v>

119
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 2>committed to original sin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And interestingly enough,</v>

120
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:16.570
<v Speaker 2>I think both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

121
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:22.090
<v Speaker 2>a lot of traditional Christians as well</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a lot of secular postmodernists,</v>

122
00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:29.570
<v Speaker 2>and this is very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone likes Sukkot is actually talking</v>

123
00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:34.430
<v Speaker 2>or he doesn't talk about it of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually giving us as a</v>

124
00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:39.431
<v Speaker 2>foundation and notion of original sin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what ever one tries to do to improve on</v>

125
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.810
<v Speaker 2>the world is doomed to futility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in fact,</v>

126
00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:52.811
<v Speaker 2>we're all driven by nothing but power</v>
<v Speaker 2>and whatever looks like an alleviation</v>

127
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:57.200
<v Speaker 2>of injustice is in fact going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>refinement of certain techniques of</v>

128
00:07:57.201 --> 00:07:58.034
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

129
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:03.190
<v Speaker 2>So when the enlightenment does a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>with those kinds of ideas of original</v>

130
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:04.430
<v Speaker 2>sin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

131
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.070
<v Speaker 2>that's a postmodern return to original</v>
<v Speaker 2>sin.</v>

132
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.200
<v Speaker 2>They're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

133
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 2>things can get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

134
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

135
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.710
<v Speaker 2>our own time has seen so many clear</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

136
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:23.940
<v Speaker 2>So somebody clear examples of ways in</v>
<v Speaker 2>which the world has been changed by</v>

137
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:27.290
<v Speaker 2>ideals for the better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not necessarily.</v>

138
00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Torture is a very good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think about the fact that 300</v>

139
00:08:31.281 --> 00:08:32.660
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

140
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.980
<v Speaker 2>scenes that would turn your stomach to</v>
<v Speaker 2>read about are things you would have</v>

141
00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:39.830
<v Speaker 2>taken your kids to watch on a Saturday</v>
<v Speaker 2>afternoon,</v>

142
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:41.930
<v Speaker 2>and you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

143
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 2>that was in the heart of civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've abolished that now,</v>

144
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we've seen in the last five years,</v>

145
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.530
<v Speaker 2>this is not necessary progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can turn the clock back.</v>

146
00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:58.950
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that has to happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>to restore America's moral authority is</v>

147
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:03.630
<v Speaker 2>for us to take a resoundingly stand</v>
<v Speaker 2>again against torture and for the</v>

148
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is a kind of progress.</v>

149
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 2>It happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

150
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:11.580
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't happen necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can happen</v>

151
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:17.190
<v Speaker 4>if we were fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>
