00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>When people entertain at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest mistake they make is kind of</v>

2
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>overreaching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They try to do too much.</v>

3
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 1>They try to make the bread and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the cream spinach and then they</v>

4
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>make the roast beef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.120
<v Speaker 1>and then they've got to make the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the red velvet cake for dessert.</v>

6
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to do all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

7
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>green salads,</v>

8
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you buy some green salads at the green</v>

9
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>marker and throw some goat cheese and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some grape tomatoes and that's your side</v>

10
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>dish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put a roast in the oven and that's</v>

11
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>your entree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:43.281
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you buy a beautiful pancake</v>
<v Speaker 1>and put some elaborate sorbet that you</v>

13
00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:46.110
<v Speaker 1>bought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you need to keep it simple.</v>

14
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>You want to have a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be frazzled.</v>

15
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>This is about having a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>and people are just so happy to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>invited into your home.</v>

17
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:54.870
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

18
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>it should not be a hassle for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

19
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.450
<v Speaker 1>it be something that you really look</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward to doing and you show off.</v>

20
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:03.030

<v Speaker 1>fancy.</v>
