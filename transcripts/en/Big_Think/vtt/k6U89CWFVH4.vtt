1
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly not having any choice,</v>

2
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>having your entire life dictated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

3
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:19.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like none of us would choose.</v>

4
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.050
<v Speaker 1>No matter where we are in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would choose to,</v>

5
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a member of Orwell's 1984 world.</v>

6
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.650
<v Speaker 1>But how much choice is really the</v>
<v Speaker 1>question when we know that some choice</v>

7
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.470
<v Speaker 1>makes you better off than no choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now do we get better off if we go from a</v>

8
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Speaker 1>lot of choice versus a few choices?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there I think the answer is much,</v>

9
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more complicated.</v>

10
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.710
<v Speaker 1>If you truly have expertise and</v>
<v Speaker 1>expertise can be,</v>

11
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>say a chess master who's really mastered</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

12
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>or I'm an artist or a musician of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort,</v>

13
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you give a jazz musician I once the</v>

14
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>jazz musician learns all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentals,</v>

15
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:10.890
<v Speaker 1>they can keep track of a lot of choices</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an instant.</v>

16
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.950
<v Speaker 1>A chess master can keep track of more</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices than the number of stars in the</v>

17
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>galaxy within an instant.</v>

18
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.260
<v Speaker 1>But these are people that have truly</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned and mastered the choices that</v>

19
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>they have and how to deal with those</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices are a very,</v>

20
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>very long period of training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So essentially what they're really doing</v>

21
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:35.481
<v Speaker 1>is ruling out all the irrelevant choices</v>
<v Speaker 1>and only zeroing in on the most</v>

22
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.510
<v Speaker 1>relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful choices at the moment.</v>

23
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>So most of the time when we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>confronted by more,</v>

24
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:46.490
<v Speaker 1>rather than a few choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're often novices.</v>

25
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 1>And so we don't really know how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate these various options.</v>

26
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.600
<v Speaker 1>We also don't always know what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in those cases,</v>

27
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>it can actually make us worse off</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's actually easier to figure</v>

28
00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 1>out what you want and to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>options differ.</v>

29
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 1>If you have about a handful of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then if you have a hundred of them.</v>
