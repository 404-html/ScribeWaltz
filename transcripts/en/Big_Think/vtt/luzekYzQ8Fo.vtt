WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.910
<v Speaker 2>president of American grand strategy</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically says nuclear weapons could</v>

3
00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:15.620
<v Speaker 2>only be possessed by countries that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>like and they cannot be possessed by cut</v>

4
00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:18.770
<v Speaker 2>trees we don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if Katrina's we don't like try and</v>

5
00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:21.530
<v Speaker 2>get nuclear weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will move heaven and earth to stop</v>

6
00:00:21.531 --> 00:00:23.570
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the basic story.</v>

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.410
<v Speaker 2>I was a codicil to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We basically would prefer that no other</v>

8
00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:30.590
<v Speaker 2>countries get nuclear weapons either</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it just complicates our lives</v>

9
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.380
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a perfect world,</v>

10
00:00:33.381 --> 00:00:37.070
<v Speaker 2>it would be nice if there were no other</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons states except the United</v>

11
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 2>States right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were already several other nuclear</v>

12
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:40.670
<v Speaker 2>weapons states other than the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>

13
00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:43.010
<v Speaker 2>We've learned how to live with other</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons states.</v>

14
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you look at the kinds of policies</v>

15
00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:52.631
<v Speaker 2>than it takes to keep other powers from</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing in their national security</v>

16
00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 2>interests inside their own border with</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own money,</v>

17
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.660
<v Speaker 2>what it is they conceive as being</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary for their national security to</v>

18
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:07.640
<v Speaker 2>try and dictate to them what they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cannot do is a big job and you need</v>

19
00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 2>a hedgematic position to be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

20
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.040
<v Speaker 2>You need decisive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crushing military superiority,</v>

21
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.470
<v Speaker 2>and you may even need to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>invade them right,</v>

22
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.750
<v Speaker 2>and if you look at the arguments about</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran and about North Korea as they've</v>

23
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 2>unfolded over the last 10 years and as</v>
<v Speaker 2>are being discussed today,</v>

24
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question lurking in the background</v>

25
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:34.961
<v Speaker 2>all the time is if you can't get them to</v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiate away these capabilities,</v>

26
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 2>which they seem to want for their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>

27
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.910
<v Speaker 2>you should be willing to fight a</v>
<v Speaker 2>preventive war,</v>

28
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 2>not a preemptive war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not attacking them before they attack</v>

29
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:54.080
<v Speaker 2>you when you think they're getting ready</v>
<v Speaker 2>to attack you,</v>

30
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.000
<v Speaker 2>but attacking them now because you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>there might be a problem later and you'd</v>

31
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:03.500
<v Speaker 2>rather not deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to have war now to avoid</v>

32
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.440
<v Speaker 2>some kind of war later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

33
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.930
<v Speaker 2>and that seems pretty good if the war is</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheap,</v>

34
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.720
<v Speaker 2>but the wars are not cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

35
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.830
<v Speaker 2>Because rubbing out another country's</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons is turns out to be a big</v>

36
00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:18.470
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to destroy factories,</v>

37
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.010
<v Speaker 2>laboratories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to wreck their economy.</v>

38
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.400
<v Speaker 2>You've got to keep the economy squeeze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to kill people or get or kidnap</v>

39
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:29.540
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists,</v>

40
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Speaker 2>engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

41
00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:36.281
<v Speaker 2>If you want to prevent a moderately</v>
<v Speaker 2>technologically advanced country,</v>

42
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:38.060
<v Speaker 2>and here we're talking about North</v>
<v Speaker 2>Korea,</v>

43
00:02:38.061 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 2>which is really nothing special from</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting this old technology of nuclear</v>

44
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:44.270
<v Speaker 2>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no an old technology.</v>

45
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:45.830
<v Speaker 2>It's not a mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

46
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.080
<v Speaker 2>You really need to be able to to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get your,</v>

47
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.520
<v Speaker 2>your hands around their neck and squeeze</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and keep squeezing.</v>

48
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.590
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>

49
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 2>how many times with how many places are</v>
<v Speaker 2>you willing to do this?</v>

50
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 2>How often are you willing to wage</v>
<v Speaker 2>preventive wars?</v>

51
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 2>How many countries do you want to be at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A constant,</v>

52
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.410
<v Speaker 2>this kind of relationship with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

53
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.820
<v Speaker 2>These are the questions you have to ask</v>
<v Speaker 2>to help.</v>

54
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 2>If we had an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to have an honest debate about</v>

55
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The United States,</v>

56
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think we have an honest</v>

57
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:21.460
<v Speaker 2>debate because the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way the debate has happened is it</v>

58
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 2>will be very bad if they got nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons.</v>

59
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 2>We have to do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All options are on the table.</v>

60
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 2>What kind of euphemism is all options</v>
<v Speaker 2>are on the table wars on the table?</v>

61
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of wars on the table?</v>

62
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 2>How many wars are on the table?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the likelihood of success?</v>

63
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.840
<v Speaker 2>What are the unintended consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 2>war to prevent nuclear proliferation?</v>

64
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are questions we should debate.</v>

65
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 2>We should ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should answer right now.</v>

66
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 2>My problem with nuclear weapons is</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather different.</v>

67
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 2>I believe that America knows how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>deter countries to have nuclear weapons.</v>

68
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 2>Countries that have nuclear weapons are</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to attack the United States</v>

69
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 2>because if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to annihilate them.</v>

70
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 2>It will be very sad for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be even sadder for them,</v>

71
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're mostly small nuclear powers.</v>

72
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 2>We are graded large nuclear power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

73
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing would be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

74
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 2>very sad and tragic and it's easy for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other side to know how tragic it's</v>

75
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 2>going to be because our nuclear forces</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not a secret,</v>

76
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have 1500 warheads on a variety of</v>

77
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 2>delivery systems and we can wreck pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>much any country in the world,</v>

78
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the residual of our Cold War</v>

79
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:32.630
<v Speaker 2>force and we are getting ready to spend</v>
<v Speaker 2>a trillion dollars modernizing that for</v>

80
00:04:32.631 --> 00:04:37.631
<v Speaker 2>us to keep it tip top shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think deterrence we can do so.</v>

81
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 2>What do I worry about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worry about not nuclear weapons in the</v>

82
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.270
<v Speaker 2>hands of states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nuclear weapons that are not in the</v>

83
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:44.200
<v Speaker 2>hands of states.</v>

84
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 2>I worry about nuclear weapons that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost.</v>

85
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Nuclear weapons that are stolen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons that are Adelaide,</v>

86
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nuclear weapons that are sold off the</v>

87
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 2>back of trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

88
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

89
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 2>people who believe in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonproliferation story will say,</v>

90
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just another reason to prevent</v>

91
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 2>more states from getting nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons.</v>

92
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

93
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.690
<v Speaker 2>but what about all the states that</v>
<v Speaker 2>already have nuclear weapons,</v>

94
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.070
<v Speaker 2>including some that I'm guessing don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really have very great can really</v>

95
00:05:12.071 --> 00:05:16.090
<v Speaker 2>terrific controls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my view is our nuclear</v>

96
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.340
<v Speaker 2>nonproliferation proliferation policies</v>
<v Speaker 2>directed at the wrong thing and the</v>

97
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.640
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we want to do is make sure that</v>

98
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons are in the hands of</v>
<v Speaker 2>states,</v>

99
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.240
<v Speaker 2>remain in the hands of states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any state that has nuclear weapons.</v>

100
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 2>We should be talking to them about best</v>
<v Speaker 2>practices to ensure that nobody sells.</v>

101
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Nobody steals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody loses.</v>

102
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Nobody breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

103
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this requires a lot of application,</v>

104
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.380
<v Speaker 2>a lot of organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right you to be a responsible nuclear</v>

105
00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:48.010
<v Speaker 2>power is hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took us a long time to learn how to</v>

106
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 2>do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've actually in the past taught others</v>

107
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 2>how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This should be the thing that we focus</v>

108
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 2>on in the world from the nuclear weapons</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

109
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because once nuclear weapons are not in</v>

110
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:03.320
<v Speaker 2>the hands of states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the hands of individuals or groups,</v>

111
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.460
<v Speaker 2>then deterrence becomes hard because a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rev,</v>

112
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 2>a radical group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a terrorist group,</v>

113
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 2>a millennial group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't mean the generation,</v>

114
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean people who imagined some magic</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment where history is going to be</v>

115
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 2>transformed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

116
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.881
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
