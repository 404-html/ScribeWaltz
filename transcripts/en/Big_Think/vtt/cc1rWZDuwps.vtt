1
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we'll engineer our way out</v>

2
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>of the energy crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think if we adopt a series of</v>

3
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:10.810
<v Speaker 1>prudent policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may get there and by that I think we</v>

5
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>need a lot greater attention paid to</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy efficiency,</v>

6
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:23.541
<v Speaker 1>which is still the single best way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with the energy situation is not to</v>

7
00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:25.950
<v Speaker 1>use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's a way to,</v>

8
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do so.</v>

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.220
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>sitting in the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about simply a better</v>

11
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:35.310
<v Speaker 1>technology that gives you the same bang</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the buck.</v>

12
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.800
<v Speaker 1>But if we focus on energy technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we moved towards cleaner vehicles and</v>

13
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>our transportation sector and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>electric utility sector,</v>

14
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can get there,</v>

16
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard slog because,</v>

17
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while we talk about,</v>

18
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>needing to reduce our energy consumption</v>

19
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:56.460
<v Speaker 1>because of concerns about climate</v>
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>

20
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>I always like to remind people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're roughly one point 6 billion</v>

21
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:05.301
<v Speaker 1>people in the world who have no access</v>
<v Speaker 1>to electricity and even more who have no</v>

22
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>access to commercial energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we can't forget those people.</v>

23
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:10.434
<v Speaker 1>As we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with our own part of the problem.</v>

25
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not,</v>

26
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>not only not fair from a human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a human point of view,</v>

27
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's more ominous than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in the kind of world we live in,</v>

28
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>in modern communications and people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have very little,</v>

29
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>certainly aren't unaware of how those of</v>
<v Speaker 1>us that have very much live and I think</v>

30
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>at some point we're going to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing a increased political violence</v>

31
00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:41.610
<v Speaker 1>and potential increased risks of</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism rather than just have people</v>

32
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 1>wallow in their misery and kind of die</v>
<v Speaker 1>unnoticed by the rest of us.</v>

33
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the developing countries,</v>

34
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.660
<v Speaker 1>of course being very poor countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking particularly maybe some of</v>

35
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:57.620
<v Speaker 1>the Central African countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>they're problem is they don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources to do what they need to do,</v>

37
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:02.370
<v Speaker 1>to adopt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

38
00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.380
<v Speaker 1>to climate change or to take actions to</v>
<v Speaker 1>mitigate the effects of climate change.</v>

40
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Many of these countries are suffering</v>
<v Speaker 1>from deforestation or growing incursions</v>

41
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>by the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we call desertification.</v>

42
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 1>And increasingly many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many parts of their countries are</v>

43
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>uninhabitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're beginning to see climate refugees</v>

44
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:26.520
<v Speaker 1>move across international frontiers in</v>
<v Speaker 1>response to these changes.</v>

45
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.330
<v Speaker 1>So I think we need to go in with</v>
<v Speaker 1>renewable energy technologies,</v>

46
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense given the local</v>

47
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 1>environment and try to provide a better</v>
<v Speaker 1>modicum of life,</v>

48
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.010
<v Speaker 1>but also to dissuade them from</v>
<v Speaker 1>continuing to denude,</v>

49
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:43.980
<v Speaker 1>the remaining forest that they have.</v>

51
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Well in many parts and many parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerging market countries,</v>

52
00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think wind and solar offer probably</v>

53
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.720
<v Speaker 1>the two greatest potentials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly all of North Africa has a</v>

55
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.680
<v Speaker 1>great solar resources and a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>desert regions have pretty consistent</v>

56
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to start with that and then</v>

57
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:09.420
<v Speaker 1>you need to use those technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 1>to help with wells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop water supplies and wind and</v>

59
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:14.070
<v Speaker 1>solar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generated electricity can help alleviate</v>

61
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of problems as well.</v>
