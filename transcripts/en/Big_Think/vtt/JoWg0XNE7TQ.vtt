1
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
<v Speaker 1>In the late 1920,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a young man outside of Tampa in Florida</v>

2
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 1>picked up an ax and hacked his family to</v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

3
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>His name is Victor Lacarta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>

4
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.890
<v Speaker 1>cannabis was not illegal in the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States and a man called Harry anslinger.</v>

5
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>I'd taken over the Department of Alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prohibition,</v>

6
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol prohibition was ending,</v>

7
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:33.830
<v Speaker 1>so you inherited this huge government</v>
<v Speaker 1>department that's just lost the war and</v>

8
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's riddled with corruption and he</v>

9
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>wants to keep it going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had previously said that cannabis was</v>

10
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>not dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't worry about it.</v>

11
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>He's suddenly decided that cannabis was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most evil.</v>

12
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is his words,</v>

13
00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>the most evil drug in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

14
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm much worse than heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

15
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:52.070
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if if Frankenstein's monster mutt</v>

16
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>cannabis on the staircase that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop dead or fried,</v>

17
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>and he latched onto the case of Victor</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lacarta with the help of the kind of Fox</v>

18
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 1>News of his day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was called the hearst newspapers.</v>

19
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>He announced that Victor Lacarta had</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoked cannabis.</v>

20
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>That's why he'd hacked his family to</v>
<v Speaker 1>death with an ax,</v>

21
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>and this is what will happen if we allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabis to spread and we need to ban</v>

22
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>and prohibit cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in the wake of that case that</v>

23
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>cannabis is band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Years later,</v>

24
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 1>somebody goes back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a researcher where many years later,</v>

25
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>decades later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a researcher went back and looked at</v>

26
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Victor Lacarta his files.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no evidence even smoke cannabis.</v>

27
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>His family had been told he needs to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutionalized the year before</v>

28
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>because it was severely mentally ill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they decided to keep him at home.</v>

29
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>The origins of the war on drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I wrote about in my book,</v>

30
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>chasing the scream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first and last days of the war on</v>

31
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:44.541
<v Speaker 1>drugs overwhelmingly looked like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you'd asked me when I started doing</v>

32
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Speaker 1>the research for chasing screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why was cannabis band?</v>

33
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.910
<v Speaker 1>I would have guessed they would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>given the reasons then,</v>

34
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>but if you stop someone on the street</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

35
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 1>they would give.</v>

36
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want kids to use drugs.</v>

37
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>We don't want people to become addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's fascinating is that stuff just</v>

38
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually never came up when they were</v>

39
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>banning cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

40
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Or indeed the other drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was overwhelmingly a kind of racial</v>

41
00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:10.311
<v Speaker 1>panic and absurd hysteria is about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what was going to happen.</v>

42
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing you can say in defense of</v>

43
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:15.660
<v Speaker 1>the war on drugs in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabis in particular,</v>

44
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 1>is we've given it a fair shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

45
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.080
<v Speaker 1>The United States has spent a trillion</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars a,</v>

46
00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 1>it's imprisoned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

47
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>more people than any other country in</v>
<v Speaker 1>human history,</v>

48
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:29.691
<v Speaker 1>including Stalin's Russia and China and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's destroyed whole countries like</v>

49
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Columbia at the end of all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't even keep drugs out of our</v>

50
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>prisons where we pay someone to walk</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the perimeter the whole time,</v>

51
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Speaker 1>which gives you some idea of how well</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're ever going to keep that out of the</v>

52
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>country with two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>3000 mile borders.</v>

53
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.380
<v Speaker 1>There is an alternative for how we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about cannabis.</v>

54
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 1>There are places that have legalized</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabis and we can see the results.</v>

55
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>So I spent a lot of time in Colorado and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington state actually spent time in</v>

56
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>places that have legalized other drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heroin,</v>

57
00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been legalized in Switzerland with</v>

58
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There have been zero overdose deaths on</v>

59
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>legal heroin in Switzerland in the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than 13 years since they,</v>

60
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>since they legalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with cannabis specifically,</v>

61
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see the results.</v>

62
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>When you banned cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several things happen.</v>

63
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that happens is it you</v>
<v Speaker 1>will have noticed it does not disappear.</v>

64
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.630
<v Speaker 1>It's transferred from licensed legal</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses to armed criminal gangsters.</v>

65
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Those armed criminal gangsters have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>operate differently to a licensed</v>

66
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

67
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 1>you will have noticed the head of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Budweiser does not go and shoot the head</v>

68
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>of Heineken in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

69
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Your local liquor store does not send</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to go and stab people in the</v>

70
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 1>local bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

71
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happened at the alcohol</v>

72
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:40.834
<v Speaker 1>prohibition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

73
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean exactly that and it ended the day</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol prohibition ended.</v>

74
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you band drugs,</v>

75
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>they have to operate in an illegal</v>
<v Speaker 1>market where there's no,</v>

76
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>and I learned this from lots of drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealers.</v>

77
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I spent time with the chasing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scream,</v>

78
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>not just for fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was some funding as well.</v>

79
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.233
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

80
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>the illegal market can only operate</v>
<v Speaker 1>through violence,</v>

81
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:01.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no recourse to the Lord.</v>

82
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

83
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I go out of here now and I tried to</v>

84
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 1>steal a bottle of vodka,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 1>the liquor store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll call the cops.</v>

86
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 1>The cops will come and take me away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no need for that liquor store</v>

87
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:14.530
<v Speaker 1>to be violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be intimidating if I go out of here</v>

88
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:16.660
<v Speaker 1>now and try to steal a bag of weed from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who sell it,</v>

89
00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:19.230
<v Speaker 1>not so far away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't call the cops.</v>

90
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 1>The cops would come and arrest them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to fight me now.</v>

91
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be having a fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday if you're a dealer.</v>

92
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.590
<v Speaker 1>So you got to establish a reputation for</v>
<v Speaker 1>being so frightening that people</v>

93
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:28.420
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be so stupid as to come and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight yet.</v>

94
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the ratchet effect you get</v>

95
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 1>with prohibition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You create a market that can only be</v>

96
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>regulated by violence and where there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a premium on being the most</v>

97
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:41.320
<v Speaker 1>violent person and the most intimidating</v>
<v Speaker 1>person when you have to be violent,</v>

98
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:45.130
<v Speaker 1>intimidating to protect your market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you legalize that goes away</v>

99
00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:47.300
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That ended.</v>

100
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Al Capone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does anyone even know the head of</v>

101
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Smirnoff's name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

102
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Everyone watching this knows Al Capone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>

103
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.480
<v Speaker 1>I bet nobody watching this knows the</v>
<v Speaker 1>head of smirnoff's name.</v>

104
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 1>What changed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the drug,</v>

105
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.640
<v Speaker 1>it's the fact that it went from being</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal and therefore controlled by</v>

106
00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 1>gangsters to legal and being controlled</v>
<v Speaker 1>by legal and licensed businesses.</v>

107
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 1>The second thing that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a slightly more wonky point but</v>

108
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I think is really interesting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

109
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 1>is that milder forms of the drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared.</v>

110
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.780
<v Speaker 1>So you often get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>

111
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't legalize cannabis because the</v>

112
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 1>cannabis people use today isn't the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabis people used it in the 19</v>

113
00:05:18.521 --> 00:05:19.091
<v Speaker 1>sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

114
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:21.600
<v Speaker 1>It's much stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's things like skunk [inaudible]</v>

115
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.080
<v Speaker 1>skunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true,</v>

116
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.260
<v Speaker 1>and it's entirely the product about</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabis prohibition.</v>

117
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>You want to understand why I got into</v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing just before alcohol was banned</v>

118
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:34.270
<v Speaker 1>in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most popular drinks by far were beer and</v>

119
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 1>wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After alcohol is legalized.</v>

120
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most popular drinks by far were beer and</v>

121
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 1>wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a main today and when alcohol</v>

122
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:43.600
<v Speaker 1>was banned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't get hold of barrel wine</v>

123
00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most popular drinks where whiskey and</v>

124
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:46.631
<v Speaker 1>Moonshine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

125
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:47.201
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

126
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Why we're banning a drug change?</v>

127
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 1>The form of the drug is kind of rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>prosaic reason,</v>

128
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 1>and actually we had to smuggle enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

129
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>alcohol for your local bar from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexican border or the Canadian border,</v>

130
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we fill our wagon with a beer,</v>

131
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 1>we'll get drink for 100 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we fill our wagon with whiskey,</v>

132
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 1>will get drink for thousands of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you ban drugs,</v>

133
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 1>there's suddenly a premium on getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest possible kick into the</v>

134
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 1>smallest possible space because it's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be smuggled,</v>

135
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:20.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be transported in secret.</v>

136
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 1>This happens with all drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I kind of.</v>

137
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 1>It's become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's become much more potent,</v>

138
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 1>most popular form of consuming cocaine</v>
<v Speaker 1>prior to it being banned was intake coca</v>

139
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 1>tea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you may remember a drink called Coca</v>

140
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Cola that really to contain exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like,</v>

141
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.690
<v Speaker 1>they don't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Went to ever hear about Coker Tea,</v>

142
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

143
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Coca Cola exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not what it was.</v>

144
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most popular way of consuming opiods</v>

145
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.620
<v Speaker 1>by far was a drink called laudanum and</v>
<v Speaker 1>something called Mrs winslow soothing</v>

146
00:06:49.161 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 1>syrup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a small trace of opiates,</v>

147
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:51.981
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

148
00:06:51.981 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 1>they disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most popular form becomes heroin when</v>

149
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:57.920
<v Speaker 1>you ban a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only the most extreme forms of that</v>

150
00:06:57.921 --> 00:06:59.840
<v Speaker 1>drugs have become available now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

151
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 1>most people who smoke cannabis don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want skunk,</v>

152
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like if I go into bar around the</v>

153
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 1>corner from here today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably very few people are can be</v>

154
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:09.680
<v Speaker 1>drinking vodka and no one's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking absinthe,</v>

155
00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:12.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're concerned about the more</v>

156
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Speaker 1>extreme forms of the drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think we should be with cannabis</v>

157
00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 1>because there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a huge relationship,</v>

158
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:19.460
<v Speaker 1>but there's some relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 1>dysfunctional behavior.</v>

159
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Then you want to pay a really high</v>
<v Speaker 1>premium on getting milder forms of the</v>

160
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:26.980
<v Speaker 1>drug available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so almost all the users he wanted.</v>

161
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another effect that happens</v>

162
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 1>with legalization and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that,</v>

163
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:33.800
<v Speaker 1>so moving everywhere I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've moved beyond the war on</v>

164
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:37.610
<v Speaker 1>drugs from Portugal where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>decriminalized all drugs to Switzerland</v>

165
00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:39.500
<v Speaker 1>where they legalized heroin addicts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Erg.</v>

166
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Why and Washington and Colorado where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they legalized cannabis.</v>

167
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 1>The pattern was always the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is super controversial at first and</v>

168
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 1>understandably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are really worried and then they</v>

169
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:52.550
<v Speaker 1>see the effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a silver bullet.</v>

170
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:54.590
<v Speaker 1>There's still problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's such a significant</v>

171
00:07:54.591 --> 00:07:59.110
<v Speaker 1>improvement that the support massively</v>
<v Speaker 1>rises.</v>

172
00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:04.111
<v Speaker 1>So 55 percent of people in Colorado</v>
<v Speaker 1>voted to legalize in 2015 today.</v>

173
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Seventy percent of people support it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Governor Hickenlooper who opposed it now</v>

174
00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:12.260
<v Speaker 1>says it works really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've had a huge increase in tax</v>

175
00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:14.750
<v Speaker 1>revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed one former police officer.</v>

176
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.530
<v Speaker 1>He told me a story about this that</v>
<v Speaker 1>really stayed with me one day in the</v>

177
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:18.770
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>

178
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.710
<v Speaker 1>He was staking out a dealer in a car</v>
<v Speaker 1>park in Wayne,</v>

179
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.760
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey in plain clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a kid came up to him and said,</v>

180
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.023
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr,</v>

181
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.130
<v Speaker 1>where you go into that liquor store and</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy me some bs.</v>

182
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not allowed to until young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a 12 year old or something,</v>

183
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:34.521
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

184
00:08:34.521 --> 00:08:35.870
<v Speaker 1>get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

185
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the kid walked over to the drug</v>

186
00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:40.130
<v Speaker 1>dealer and bought some drugs from him</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead.</v>

187
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.170
<v Speaker 1>And he had this kind of epiphany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

188
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.570
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

189
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.930
<v Speaker 1>legalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal regulated system puts a barrier</v>

190
00:08:47.931 --> 00:08:50.300
<v Speaker 1>between children and drugs that does not</v>
<v Speaker 1>currently exist.</v>

191
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 1>If you're a parent who doesn't want your</v>
<v Speaker 1>child to smoke cannabis,</v>

192
00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 1>and if you're a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't because there is evidence</v>

193
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 1>that it can impair development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

194
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 1>for teenagers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to put a really high premium on</v>

195
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.100
<v Speaker 1>getting cannabis out of the hands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>armed criminal gangs.</v>

196
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't care whether the customers are</v>
<v Speaker 1>13,</v>

197
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 1>30 or 80 and getting into the hands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>licensed legal,</v>

198
00:09:11.311 --> 00:09:13.140
<v Speaker 1>regulated businesses who have something</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lose.</v>

199
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.190
<v Speaker 1>This is why in Colorado all the research</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows that's been a really significant</v>

200
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:19.200
<v Speaker 1>fall in cartel and organized crime</v>
<v Speaker 1>activities.</v>

201
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.870
<v Speaker 1>They legalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a fallen teenagers using.</v>

202
00:09:21.871 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 1>It was already quite low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's fallen.</v>

203
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.010
<v Speaker 1>There's been a massive increase in tax</v>
<v Speaker 1>revenue.</v>

204
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not perfect.</v>

205
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.710
<v Speaker 1>There were some things I would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweaked in the Colorado legalization,</v>

206
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tweak a legal market,</v>

207
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.810
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have any power over an illegal</v>
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

208
00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing we can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

209
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.580
<v Speaker 1>At some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president of Switzerland,</v>

210
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Ruth Dreifuss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she made the case to the threats,</v>

211
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.370
<v Speaker 1>people for legalizing heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

212
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.790
<v Speaker 1>She's one of the great heroes I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>met in my life.</v>

213
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.000
<v Speaker 1>She explained to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

214
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:53.340
<v Speaker 1>when you hear the word legalization is</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture like anarchy and chaos.</v>

215
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.660
<v Speaker 1>What we have now is anarchy and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have unknown criminals selling</v>

216
00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 1>unknown chemicals to unknown drug users.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All in the dark,</v>

217
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.720
<v Speaker 1>all filled with violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

218
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Legalization is the way we restore order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this chaos.</v>

219
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:08.850
<v Speaker 1>At some point we have to look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>

220
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:12.030
<v Speaker 1>It's worked incredibly well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's look at the places that are</v>

221
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.840
<v Speaker 1>maintaining a criminal warrant cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that working out for you?</v>
