1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.680
<v Speaker 1>The value added to theater and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this is a debate that has gone on</v>

2
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:07.350
<v Speaker 1>for millions of years and hopefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll still go over a of years,</v>

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.410
<v Speaker 1>is that there is no experience like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's live your live,</v>

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 1>they're live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're feeding off you,</v>

5
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 1>your feeding off them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.610
<v Speaker 1>and an audience senses that and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is an added value and I don't</v>

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>really care how technology pushes us</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>There's never going to be anything like</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in a theater with 100 or 1000</v>

9
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:31.410
<v Speaker 1>people around you laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crying,</v>

10
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing all those emotional things that,</v>

11
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>that hopefully good theater will do for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

12
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.150
<v Speaker 1>And my challenge and the challenge that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have as an industry is getting people</v>

13
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.870
<v Speaker 1>to recognize that and into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>the theater and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the complaint that I hear I hear to the</v>

15
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:54.681
<v Speaker 1>most about theater specifically the</v>
<v Speaker 1>price and the accessibility and the</v>

16
00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>accessibility.</v>

17
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The accessibility is something as an</v>

18
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think actually technology and the</v>

19
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>theater world can marry more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people out there that don't</v>

20
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 1>know how to get tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they think that getting tickets are</v>

21
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand.</v>

22
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>You can go online now and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>

23
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technology in that case has helped</v>

24
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>the theater industry tremendously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was a day,</v>

25
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not that old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a day that I remember the</v>

26
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:25.880
<v Speaker 1>only way you could get a theater ticket</v>
<v Speaker 1>was to go to the box office know and,</v>

27
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>and now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

28
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:29.640
<v Speaker 1>we've expanded that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is,</v>

29
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.700
<v Speaker 1>it is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me the idea of it being too expensive</v>

30
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>is something that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a challenge to the industry to and to</v>

31
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>that I always say my job is to let</v>
<v Speaker 1>people know there are many ways and many</v>

32
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 1>different prices of seeing shows.</v>

33
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 1>There's the tk ats booth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

34
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

35
00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>there's direct mail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's email blasts.</v>

36
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:56.361
<v Speaker 1>We're starting to use that technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think those two obstacles when</v>

37
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>you add it together and the added value</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to,</v>

38
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 1>to get the world on the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no experience like live theater</v>

39
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>that they can't be live streaming hd</v>
<v Speaker 1>filming.</v>

40
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the audience that is listening to</v>

41
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>this conversation right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be,</v>

42
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not at all like if we were sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a room live and that's the,</v>

43
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>the excitement of live theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We find that the younger generation,</v>

44
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>unless they have come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been brought to the theater,</v>

45
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like their grandmothers form of</v>

46
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.370
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that personally,</v>

48
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.860
<v Speaker 1>I have been a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

49
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.040
<v Speaker 1>most of my career have been a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>advocate of getting a school children</v>

50
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.970
<v Speaker 1>into the theater and whether that is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday matinee where you donate</v>

51
00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>tickets or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a program right now with the</v>

52
00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>city school system that we choose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>one school every Wednesday matinee.</v>

54
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they get 100 tickets.</v>

55
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Some of the schools do it on merit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some do it on financial need.</v>

56
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each school is a little bit different.</v>

57
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 1>But I find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the greatest joys</v>

58
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:15.901
<v Speaker 1>that I have as a producer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is watching those kids watch a show.</v>

59
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Many of them for the very first time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell which ones are hooked,</v>

60
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>you can tell because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sensing without any explanation</v>

61
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 1>there watching someone live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember once when I was producing a</v>

62
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>musical called jellies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last jam and the Lake Gregory hines play</v>

63
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Jelly Roll Morton and we took every</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday matinee.</v>

64
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 1>They were a hundred inner school in city</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

65
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Kids that got to see the show and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday matinee.</v>

66
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.500
<v Speaker 1>A couple of kids didn't realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 1>they saw it was live but they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know the decorum of theater and they</v>

68
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 1>were screaming out.</v>

69
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Gregory Gregory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

70
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>my man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>and they were just so excited and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of stopped the show and he just</v>

72
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 1>very calmly said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.040
<v Speaker 1>we are so glad you are here is so cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

74
00:04:04.041 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>what's not cool?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to,</v>

75
00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll tell you what man,</v>

76
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.010
<v Speaker 1>why don't you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>

77
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>let's do the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how this works.</v>

78
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>And then you guys come back stage and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can wrap and these kids will like over</v>

79
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.930
<v Speaker 1>the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't because they were,</v>

80
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ruda some,</v>

81
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:19.680
<v Speaker 1>but they will hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

82
00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:23.170
<v Speaker 1>I was watching those kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were so hooked onto live theater.</v>

83
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:26.080
<v Speaker 1>And I thought this is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had just never experienced that</v>

84
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:27.400
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

85
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:28.390
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every form,</v>

86
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.090
<v Speaker 1>event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attendance,</v>

87
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 1>these kids that had up to this point in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their life was a movie,</v>

88
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:33.820
<v Speaker 1>was a TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a video,</v>

89
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 1>was something they had never gone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>had that,</v>

90
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.430
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a person up there.</v>

91
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 1>And they happen to know the person was</v>
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

92
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love when that happens.</v>

93
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge added value.</v>

94
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.970
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were saying the great white way is</v>

95
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

96
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:51.640
<v Speaker 1>they were calling other fabulous</v>
<v Speaker 1>invalid.</v>

97
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it ever will die because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

98
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 1>A feeling that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea that you can't get it anywhere</v>

99
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the younger generation,</v>

100
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>they may be slower to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

101
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we do our job right,</v>

102
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:08.280
<v Speaker 1>we'll get them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.600
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are those kind of hip cool shows</v>

104
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 1>where it's cool to go and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

105
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:13.840
<v Speaker 1>this isn't so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know.</v>

106
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you kinda got them.</v>

107
00:05:15.951 --> 00:05:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
