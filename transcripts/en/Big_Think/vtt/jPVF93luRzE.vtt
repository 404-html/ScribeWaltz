<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.220
<v Speaker 2>the short answer to that question</v>
<v Speaker 2>because</v>

3
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 2>when I began writing this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually had had the,</v>

4
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:17.994
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 2>the word grown up idealist is a word</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had occurred to me for a long time</v>

6
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:25.730
<v Speaker 2>in thinking about Kant and indeed in</v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching count,</v>

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 2>I've been teaching cottonelle wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>

8
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

9
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 2>For nearly 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

10
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 2>on and off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I was teaching college at Yale,</v>

11
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 2>I used the word grownup idealist to</v>
<v Speaker 2>describe view viewers.</v>

12
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 2>I've explained it to Barack Obama was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first politician that I have ever</v>

13
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.960
<v Speaker 2>come across who I genuinely think has an</v>
<v Speaker 2>eye for both the way things are and the</v>

14
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:54.141
<v Speaker 2>way that things should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he embodies the American dream</v>

15
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:58.340
<v Speaker 2>in a way that we have not ever seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

16
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 2>in a way that embodies both the</v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrant dream,</v>

17
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.930
<v Speaker 2>a sense of perspective about the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

18
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:08.931
<v Speaker 2>combined with a genuine appreciation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American dream.</v>

19
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's,</v>

20
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely brilliant.</v>

21
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what convinced me about Barack Obama was</v>

22
00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:25.460
<v Speaker 2>actually his first book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreams from my father.</v>

23
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.600
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

24
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.860
<v Speaker 2>which is a book that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>recommending to people who then walk</v>

25
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:31.880
<v Speaker 2>away saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

26
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:35.210
<v Speaker 2>even if he's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't become president,</v>

27
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.450
<v Speaker 2>this is such a good book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone would've been proud to have</v>

28
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:40.100
<v Speaker 2>written it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's subtle,</v>

29
00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:43.880
<v Speaker 2>it's reflective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's self reflective itself critical.</v>

30
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's observant.</v>

31
00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:47.870
<v Speaker 2>Then it's poetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

32
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.770
<v Speaker 2>all of which are reveal a sense of</v>
<v Speaker 2>character that I think we'll all be</v>

33
00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:03.851
<v Speaker 2>proud to have in our next president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a final point that I have not seen</v>

34
00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:08.330
<v Speaker 2>anybody raise about Obama is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>following.</v>

35
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Obama really does represent the triumph</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the civil rights movement.</v>

36
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.060
<v Speaker 2>There's racism in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no question.</v>

37
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:22.061
<v Speaker 2>We've also seen it in the election and</v>
<v Speaker 2>electing Barack Obama will not get rid</v>

38
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:25.790
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it will be a giant step</v>

39
00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:26.624
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

40
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
<v Speaker 2>I think one reason why so many people of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all ages are being inspired by Barack</v>

41
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it the civil rights movement really</v>

42
00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:40.100
<v Speaker 2>is a moment that Americans in our recent</v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

43
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 2>the American can be genuinely proud of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a genuine moral,</v>

44
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 2>morally political movement with all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>its frailties.</v>

45
00:02:51.791 --> 00:02:55.570
<v Speaker 2>I just saw a terrific play called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good Negro,</v>

46
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.390
<v Speaker 2>a downtown which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

47
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 2>talks the frailties and the infighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the things that happened in the</v>

48
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:07.261
<v Speaker 2>civil rights movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet it was a unique moment.</v>

49
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have an instance of that in</v>

50
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 2>other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

51
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 2>you have countries throwing off</v>
<v Speaker 2>colonialism,</v>

52
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.780
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have a moment in which a</v>
<v Speaker 2>country looked at its own ideals and</v>

53
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

54
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.890
<v Speaker 2>we're not living up to them and it may</v>
<v Speaker 2>be bloody and painful and hard and</v>

55
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 2>reluctant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to change because we</v>

56
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 2>know that we're not living up to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>standards that we set to ourselves.</v>

57
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.280
<v Speaker 2>And I think a sense that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

58
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 2>this crystallizes something in America</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be proud of again,</v>

59
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.200
<v Speaker 2>is a perhaps what Michelle Obama meant</v>
<v Speaker 2>with her slightly,</v>

60
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>misspoken comments that I completely</v>

61
00:03:55.271 --> 00:04:00.271
<v Speaker 2>understand when my own teenagers who</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at politics completely skeptically</v>

62
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:07.621
<v Speaker 2>up to now see an interview with him on</v>
<v Speaker 2>television and come to me and had been</v>

63
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 2>making fun of the grownups are being</v>
<v Speaker 2>excited for awhile.</v>

64
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 2>My get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's for real.</v>

65
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 2>And if he's elected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will change the world.</v>

66
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 2>And I have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

67
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 2>Barack Obama has made in America an</v>
<v Speaker 2>offer we couldn't refuse.</v>
