1
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>So the second grade on truth always</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust your feelings.</v>

2
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>The wisdom traditions of the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>world say don't do that.</v>

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.020
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the quotes we have in the book,</v>

4
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Shakespeare,</v>

5
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but thinking makes it so from Marcus</v>

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Aurelius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole world has changed and life</v>

7
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>itself is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you deem it,</v>

8
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Buddha,</v>

9
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>our thoughts are the creations of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>minds.</v>

10
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>With our minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We make the world.</v>

11
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.450
<v Speaker 1>CBT is just a way of teaching people</v>
<v Speaker 1>skills to do exactly that,</v>

12
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>to question their feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look for evidence.</v>

13
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in CBT you learn the names of these</v>

14
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.680
<v Speaker 1>distortions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 15 or so distortions.</v>

15
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>You can guess what they mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catastrophizing,</v>

16
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.020
<v Speaker 1>black and white thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>labeling,</v>

17
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>mind reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the things that depressed and</v>

18
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>anxious people do a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One way to sort of keep all of us have</v>

19
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 1>had experiences of these.</v>

20
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.450
<v Speaker 1>One thing I like to think about as homer</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simpson saying,</v>

21
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>shut up brain or I'll stab you with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>qtip.</v>

22
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Our brains do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our brains go on and on.</v>

23
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>But like stop it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop it,</v>

24
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 1>stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 1>CBT is a way of stopping it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to learn.</v>

26
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including me,</v>

27
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 1>learned it from a wonderful book by</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Burns called feeling good.</v>

28
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our book,</v>

29
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>we and on our webpage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to the coddling.org,</v>

30
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have suggestions for books and apps</v>

31
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.050
<v Speaker 1>where you can learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cognitive behavioral therapy is not more</v>

32
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>effective than several other treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are.</v>

33
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Most treatments are about equally</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective,</v>

34
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's so easy to learn if you teach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've done this in my classes,</v>

35
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:39.150
<v Speaker 1>if you assign everyone in the class to</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn CBT,</v>

36
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.610
<v Speaker 1>most people get it and get something out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

37
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Other techniques like meditation work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're harder.</v>

38
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Most people drop off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cbt is easy,</v>

39
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>really well tested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a huge impact on a variety of mental</v>

40
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 1>health and mental illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially those related to depression</v>

41
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think every college student and heck,</v>

42
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>every high school student should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught these basic skills given how high</v>

43
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>the rates of anxiety and depression are</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

44
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 1>So for the last few years we've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing reports that counseling centers</v>

45
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>on campus or overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're hearing stories about rising</v>

46
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>depression and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people say,</v>

47
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing to be alarmed about.</v>

48
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that young people today,</v>

49
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>they're so comfortable talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental illness,</v>

50
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>they're more open about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why the rates seem to be</v>

51
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>rising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds plausible.</v>

52
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Not True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that young people are more</v>

53
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know this because studies have been</v>

54
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:38.670
<v Speaker 1>done looking at hospital admission data</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is being admitted to hospitals</v>

55
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>because they cut themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took poison,</v>

56
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.380
<v Speaker 1>they harmed themselves in some other</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

57
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.570
<v Speaker 1>We see exactly the same curves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>on that date in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boys are not changing,</v>

59
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>but girls are going way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way up.</v>

60
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Only teenage girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not millennials,</v>

61
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:57.801
<v Speaker 1>not kids born before 1995 but kids born</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1995 and after the girls in</v>

62
00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 1>particular are cutting themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>being admitted to hospitals and much</v>

63
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>higher rates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most alarmingly,</v>

64
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>the suicide rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the last couple of years,</v>

65
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>compared to the first 10 years of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

66
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 1>the suicide rate for American boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teenage boys is up 25%,</v>

67
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>which is a gigantic increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The suicide rate for American girls is</v>

68
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>up to 70%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So something is going wrong.</v>

69
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Something is affecting American</v>
<v Speaker 1>teenagers,</v>

70
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>especially girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

71
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>so in the United States right now is</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people have noticed,</v>

72
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>

73
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are seeing a huge escalation of our</v>

74
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>long running culture war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

75
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 1>universities are right in the heart of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

76
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>The right loves to come in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

77
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>the university is our bastions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness.</v>

78
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>They've lost their minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The left is motivated to say,</v>

79
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no not a problem.</v>

80
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that the right hates ideas.</v>

81
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 1>They hate universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way that this whole book started</v>

82
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 1>is that Greg Lukey on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>off my coauthor and friend,</v>

83
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is prone to depression and he had a</v>

84
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:06.811
<v Speaker 1>suicidal depression in 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was hospitalized and he learned</v>

85
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>cognitive behavioral therapy as part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his treatment and he credits it with</v>

86
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 1>saving his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

87
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>so he goes back to his job as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>president of the foundation for</v>

88
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:19.450
<v Speaker 1>individual rights and education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been fighting for free speech</v>

89
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>rights for students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing back against administrators who</v>

90
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>are always imposing speech limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Students were always his best</v>

91
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.470
<v Speaker 1>supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Students generally wanted the rights to</v>

92
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 1>speak and think and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

93
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 1>and be independent.</v>

94
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Until 2013 beginning of the fall of 2013</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started seeing the first cases of</v>

95
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:40.660
<v Speaker 1>students saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want protections from words,</v>

96
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:41.620
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

97
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want speakers.</v>

98
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Disinvited don't let this person onto</v>
<v Speaker 1>our campus.</v>

99
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Not because it will be offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because it will be dangerous.</v>

100
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>It will be harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be traumatizing.</v>

101
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 1>We want trigger warnings if you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to assign a book that has violence in</v>

102
00:04:58.541 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially sexual violence,</v>

103
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 1>like a Greek myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has rape,</v>

104
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to sign that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to warn students against it.</v>

105
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that they can choose whether they</v>

106
00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 1>want to absent themselves on that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this was something new.</v>

107
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>And at first it was just a strange thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a few schools.</v>

108
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.650
<v Speaker 1>And then over the following year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it built to the point where in 2014 we</v>

109
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 1>started reading articles in the new</v>
<v Speaker 1>republic and the New York Times about</v>

110
00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 1>trigger warnings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe spaces,</v>

111
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.570
<v Speaker 1>microaggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

112
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 1>bias response teams.</v>

113
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>A whole set of constructs and procedures</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerged on certain universities,</v>

114
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 1>not everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but especially at elite schools in the</v>

115
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:38.530
<v Speaker 1>northeast and on the west coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A way of protecting students from words,</v>

116
00:05:38.531 --> 00:05:39.071
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

117
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:42.010
<v Speaker 1>and speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speakers were shouted down increasingly</v>

118
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>not because they were offensive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hateful because they were dangerous.</v>

119
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.750
<v Speaker 1>For students to think about ideas in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of right or wrong is great,</v>

120
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>exciting versus boring is great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but safe versus dangerous.</v>

121
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>This is a terrible way to approach the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

122
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.113
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Greg came to talk to me because what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw with students doing the exact</v>

124
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>cognitive distortions that he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned to stop doing when he was</v>

125
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 1>treated for cognitive behavioral therapy</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he's treated for depression,</v>

126
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.750
<v Speaker 1>greg was concerned that if students are</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to think this way about safety</v>

127
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 1>and danger and harmfulness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is gonna make them depressed</v>

128
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:18.824
<v Speaker 1>and anxious.</v>

129
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's what led us to write our</v>
<v Speaker 1>original article in the,</v>

130
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>in the Atlantic in 2015 titled the</v>
<v Speaker 1>coddling of the American mind.</v>

131
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we published the article in 2015 before</v>

132
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 1>a big wave of student protests in around</v>
<v Speaker 1>Halloween of 2015.</v>

133
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these trends that we saw that greg and I</v>

134
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:42.011
<v Speaker 1>both saw hints of in 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they exploded in the fall of 2015.</v>

135
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've spread much more widely in the</v>

136
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 1>couple of years since then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time we're seeing rates</v>

137
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 1>of depression and anxiety increasing</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly too.</v>

138
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 1>We're not saying these are causing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know,</v>

139
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 1>but there is a national wave of</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>

140
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Students are thinking in terms of safety</v>
<v Speaker 1>and danger.</v>

141
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Students say by their own admission they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are more fragile.</v>

142
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.180
<v Speaker 1>They use a language of fragility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weakness,</v>

143
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:08.690
<v Speaker 1>trauma triggering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see triggers all over the world.</v>

144
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 1>What are triggers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Triggers are cases where you take a part</v>

145
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:16.220
<v Speaker 1>of your nervous system and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone says that word,</v>

146
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.790
<v Speaker 1>they can control my nervous system and</v>
<v Speaker 1>make me afraid and anxious.</v>

147
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.890
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should not be teaching our kids to,</v>

148
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 1>to see the world as being full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>triggers.</v>

149
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.330
<v Speaker 1>We should teach them to live in a world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is physically quite safe,</v>

150
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.640
<v Speaker 1>but full of offensive statements and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

151
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.690
<v Speaker 1>especially on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A sad commentary on the state of a,</v>

152
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 1>of the business world now is that Google</v>
<v Speaker 1>is being sued from both sides,</v>

153
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 1>from women who say that they're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>victims of a hostile climate and from</v>

154
00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:46.280
<v Speaker 1>conservatives and white men who say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>conserves and white men are</v>

155
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:48.380
<v Speaker 1>discriminated against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in our current era,</v>

156
00:07:48.381 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 1>everybody feels they're a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

157
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:56.110
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that diversity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives is essential for healthy</v>

158
00:07:56.361 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 1>organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially those who care about</v>

159
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to address all of the diversity</v>

160
00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:03.170
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time.</v>

161
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 1>We can't pit them against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to work on our speech climate,</v>

162
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the business world is called speak up</v>

163
00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:09.820
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

164
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.400
<v Speaker 1>in the academic world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called just basic openness to</v>

165
00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:16.430
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're having problems all across</v>

166
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>American society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to work on them.</v>
