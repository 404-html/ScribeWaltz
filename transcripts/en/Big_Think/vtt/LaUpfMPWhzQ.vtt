00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Disconnect is three different stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were pulled right out of the</v>

2
00:00:03.151 --> 00:00:06.270
<v Speaker 1>headlines and dramatized and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>threaded together,</v>

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

4
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.510
<v Speaker 1>to create an emotional thriller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the way that technology,</v>

5
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.660
<v Speaker 1>all these screens in our lives can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>can bring us closer and then can also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>keep us farther apart from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from each other.</v>

8
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>the movies not just about technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also about the way in which we</v>

10
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 1>communicate with each other about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>people talk to each other.</v>

11
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

12
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>that was very interesting to me and very</v>
<v Speaker 1>important to me to explores the way in</v>

13
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:37.740
<v Speaker 1>which we communicate and to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately the movies much more about</v>

14
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:40.350
<v Speaker 1>the power of human communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>then about technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technology is neither good nor bad.</v>

16
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Speaker 1>It is a reflection of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>technology puts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts,</v>

18
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.890
<v Speaker 1>makes bombs and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it can,</v>

19
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put,</v>

20
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>put us on Mars.</v>

21
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I've met people who were very</v>
<v Speaker 1>distractable people who are always on</v>

22
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>their phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were distractible people to begin</v>

23
00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've met wonderfully calm and wise</v>

24
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>people who keep their phones in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>pockets.</v>

25
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 1>And especially during dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were calm and centered people.</v>

26
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.640
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think technology makes us do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

27
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a personalities that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressed through all these devices that</v>

28
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things,</v>

29
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:17.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.540
<v Speaker 1>the film tries to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've never had been able to be as close</v>

31
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.210
<v Speaker 1>with all these people everywhere in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives on different continents before,</v>

32
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 1>as we have now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's very exciting.</v>

33
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you are connected to thousands</v>

34
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to find time for the people</v>

36
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>that you really want to connect with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:46.971
<v Speaker 1>so that's just one of the ways in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>the duality of technology affects our</v>

38
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:49.370
<v Speaker 1>attention span.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

39
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>we've never been in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind connected with so many people</v>

40
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 1>that we've never been asked to focus on</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many different things until this time</v>

41
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

42
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 1>now we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.580
<v Speaker 1>it is so easy to talk to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 300 people in a day.</v>

44
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's an exciting time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for us,</v>

45
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>for us humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>but with it comes a,</v>

47
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>that was Samantha's phone that just went</v>
<v Speaker 1>off and gave us a little interlude.</v>

48
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.040
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's really exciting.</v>

49
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love technology.</v>

50
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited that I was alive when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet exploded.</v>

51
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>This is not an anti technology movie at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

52
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's asking questions that I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone is asking every day,</v>

53
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.270
<v Speaker 1>how much time do you spend on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet or how much time do you spend</v>

54
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 1>on your phone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much time do you spend connected</v>

55
00:02:56.341 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>with those 100 people as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>those 100 people,</v>

56
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who do you really give your time and</v>

57
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>your attention to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are decisions we have to make now</v>

58
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas,</v>

59
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

60
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago we didn't have to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>those decisions.</v>

61
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just sort of hung out with whoever</v>

62
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>was in front of us.</v>
