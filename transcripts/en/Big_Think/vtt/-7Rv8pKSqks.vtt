1
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we like to do as,</v>

2
00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a society is,</v>

3
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:16.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

4
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>is put things in boxes and label things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.623
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to be able to say this is an </v>

6
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:27.261
<v Speaker 1>elephant and this is a zebra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was very easy to do that with,</v>

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with blogs and journalism.</v>

8
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was easier than it is now,</v>

9
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a couple of years ago.</v>

10
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>So bloggers operated a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to be treated a certain way.</v>

11
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:41.810
<v Speaker 1>They had an expectation level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

12
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an ethos of,</v>

13
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>of transparency and ethos of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing things that you do and you don't </v>

15
00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:50.634
<v Speaker 1>do it with bloggers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was kind of an unwritten rule that </v>

16
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>was published.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

17
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.903
<v Speaker 1>but what we've seen over the last couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of years though is that the elephants </v>

18
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>and zebras have made it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know what's,</v>

19
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:03.564
<v Speaker 1>what anymore.</v>

20
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.763
<v Speaker 1>So we have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have journalists that blog all the </v>

21
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 1>time and I'm on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.303
<v Speaker 1>and yet we still have to treat them like</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional journalists and is </v>

23
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:15.290
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

24
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.843
<v Speaker 1>and as a way of operating with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are bloggers that basically one </v>

25
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:21.654
<v Speaker 1>little media companies and we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they expect to be treated a certain way </v>

26
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 1>but not quite the same way that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>the times once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.570
<v Speaker 1>but with different kinds of rules of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>

29
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>And then we have individuals that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no rules whatsoever.</v>

30
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>They just individuals who had day jobs </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are publishing for passion.</v>

31
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.840
<v Speaker 1>So it's very blurry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

32
00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:44.674
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the rules of engagement really a </v>

33
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 1>variant and the blending of what's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist and what's a blogger is,</v>

34
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is obliterate.</v>

35
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:54.414
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's more clear if you work for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>major media organization that you're a </v>

37
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>journalist and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty clear cut,</v>

38
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.881
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:04.720
<v Speaker 1>let's take us out like tech crunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.371
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>one of the most popular blogs on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>web,</v>

42
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:09.330
<v Speaker 1>which is independent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>is that a media company?</v>

44
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Do we treat them like we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Journalists don't know.</v>

45
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

46
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>it's an or talking points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's another example.</v>

47
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.613
<v Speaker 1>So I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at each individual is going to </v>

48
00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:23.304
<v Speaker 1>develop their own rules of engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each company will develop their own </v>

49
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 1>rules of engagement and some of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be written in,</v>

50
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:29.304
<v Speaker 1>some of those will be unwritten and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have to test them in an ethical </v>

51
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:34.590
<v Speaker 1>way and see and we'll see what works and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what doesn't.</v>

52
00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example with blogging.</v>

53
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.740
<v Speaker 1>a blogging as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a company and not with people or uh,</v>

55
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.470
<v Speaker 1>or fake blogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.290
<v Speaker 1>never went anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something that was a,</v>

57
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.100
<v Speaker 1>that was kind of a nonstarter on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

58
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.003
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this seems to be more receptivity </v>

59
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:53.860
<v Speaker 1>towards that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

60
00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:54.694
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there seems to be some more </v>

61
00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>acceptance there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every community,</v>

62
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>every site seems every person who seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have their own rules and it's,</v>

63
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>it's extraordinarily messy and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to just box things up.</v>

64
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.540
<v Speaker 1>So I joined Edelman in 2006 and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started my blog in,</v>

65
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.880
<v Speaker 1>in 2004.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

66
00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:18.714
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was the first two years I was </v>

67
00:03:20.791 --> 00:03:21.624
<v Speaker 1>blogging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a small PR company with 30 </v>

68
00:03:23.611 --> 00:03:25.350
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we had,</v>

69
00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:27.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 clients and,</v>

70
00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:30.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gave me a canvas that was huge.</v>

71
00:03:30.271 --> 00:03:31.104
<v Speaker 1>I could write a anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody not be concerned about it </v>

72
00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:33.750
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.603
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really have to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting tripped up when I went to </v>

74
00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:38.190
<v Speaker 1>edelman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

75
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a client that's an organization </v>

76
00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:43.200
<v Speaker 1>with 3,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>people around the world and,</v>

77
00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:45.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have thousands of clients and I don't</v>

78
00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:46.470
<v Speaker 1>even know who our clients are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

79
00:03:46.471 --> 00:03:48.120
<v Speaker 1>it's just so it's just huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

80
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could represent one company in,</v>

81
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.061
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:54.030
<v Speaker 1>in one market and not represent them </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else.</v>

83
00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:54.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's really,</v>

85
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very huge organization.</v>

86
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:04:01.831 --> 00:04:03.720
<v Speaker 1>the wakeup call I got was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

88
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.300
<v Speaker 1>about two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

89
00:04:06.301 --> 00:04:08.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>initially when I got on twitter,</v>

90
00:04:08.761 --> 00:04:12.150
<v Speaker 1>actually I'm in a stream of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

91
00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I just began to write about my media </v>
<v Speaker 1>habits.</v>

92
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.050
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:04:16.051 --> 00:04:17.880
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.833
<v Speaker 1>at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was getting a complimentary </v>

95
00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:23.220
<v Speaker 1>subscription to the print edition of Pc </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine and,</v>

96
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what I ended up writing was I get</v>

97
00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:28.110
<v Speaker 1>a copy of Pc magazine for free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I throw it away.</v>

98
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I said I said that is because</v>

99
00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:32.610
<v Speaker 1>I actually was reading it online at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

100
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm somebody who doesn't like us,</v>

101
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doesn't like Edelman,</v>

102
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reached out to the editor of PC magazine</v>

103
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.590
<v Speaker 1>at the time and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:45.660
<v Speaker 1>he was understandably upset about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

105
00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:46.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wrote a,</v>

106
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.220
<v Speaker 1>a pretty nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

107
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.133
<v Speaker 1>op-ed.</v>

108
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.373
<v Speaker 1>I'm criticizing not just a me but </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically threatening to black list our </v>

109
00:04:55.651 --> 00:04:58.110
<v Speaker 1>entire pr firm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

110
00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.003
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was basically saying he was </v>

111
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.980
<v Speaker 1>posturing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he would,</v>

112
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

113
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.713
<v Speaker 1>any approach from our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a to him or his editors would just </v>

114
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.540
<v Speaker 1>be a nonstarter because of this little </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweet that I wrote.</v>

115
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.140
<v Speaker 1>And that was a huge wakeup call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

116
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I had to go on my blog and a and a and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ride a,</v>

117
00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:16.800
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an apology,</v>

118
00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:17.760
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

119
00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:20.190
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like somebody twisted my arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was real already to do that.</v>

120
00:05:20.191 --> 00:05:22.560
<v Speaker 1>I had no intention of slamming it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a,</v>

121
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.023
<v Speaker 1>it was just something I wrote in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stream of consciousness and in twitter </v>

122
00:05:25.981 --> 00:05:27.750
<v Speaker 1>didn't give me a lot of room in it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was early,</v>

123
00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:29.850
<v Speaker 1>early days for twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

124
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.713
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a sign to me that I can't do </v>

125
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:35.880
<v Speaker 1>what I was doing before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

126
00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:36.714
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that level of freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not because somebody's watching </v>

127
00:05:40.081 --> 00:05:41.250
<v Speaker 1>over me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's because I just,</v>

128
00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:42.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to,</v>

129
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.193
<v Speaker 1>I have to protect the firm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to protect our clients and </v>

130
00:05:45.661 --> 00:05:47.250
<v Speaker 1>obviously as part of that I got of </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect me.</v>

131
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.020
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that was,</v>

132
00:05:49.021 --> 00:05:49.501
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

133
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:50.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

134
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.680
<v Speaker 1>a pretty bad experience then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

135
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.633
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 1>I came out for the better for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think so to de Soto.</v>
