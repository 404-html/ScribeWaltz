1
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Sensory deprivation is where we put </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in dark soundproof rooms or water</v>

2
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:17.700
<v Speaker 1>tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are becoming aware that we needed</v>

3
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>sensation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulation,</v>

4
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>variation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulation,</v>

5
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>all of us as much as we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a float in the water and so forth.</v>

6
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 1>The basic needs and deprivation of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of stimulation,</v>

7
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead to,</v>

8
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

9
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very uncomfortable states.</v>

10
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we,</v>

11
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.703
<v Speaker 1>we asked is there a personality trait </v>
<v Speaker 1>that some people need more stimulation </v>

12
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>or more variety or intensity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulation than others.</v>

13
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's when we developed our first </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensation seeking scale.</v>

14
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.680
<v Speaker 1>And subsequently that expanded became </v>
<v Speaker 1>the main focus of my research is the,</v>

15
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.394
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were surprised by how many things </v>

16
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.410
<v Speaker 1>were affected by this trait sensation </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking.</v>

17
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>And then we got interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological basis.</v>

18
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>It's genetic and biological basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here again,</v>

19
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:16.224
<v Speaker 1>we had some very interesting findings </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed to the fact that this is a very </v>

20
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.470
<v Speaker 1>fundamental trait with biological roots.</v>

21
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.023
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is determined from twin studies </v>

22
00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:31.850
<v Speaker 1>called biometrics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a behavioral genetics actually.</v>

23
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

24
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:36.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using these twin studies,</v>

25
00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:41.351
<v Speaker 1>we initially found that roughly 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent heritability heritability is the</v>

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.170
<v Speaker 1>proportion of the variance trait that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>determined by genetics.</v>

27
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.843
<v Speaker 1>And we discovered there was 60 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very high for personality </v>

28
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:53.594
<v Speaker 1>trait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which generally run between 30 and 50 </v>

29
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.074
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 60 percent is high for a personality </v>

30
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:00.741
<v Speaker 1>trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

31
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:03.620
<v Speaker 1>it's higher for intelligence and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other traits.</v>

32
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.610
<v Speaker 1>So a little more recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was established,</v>

34
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:13.340
<v Speaker 1>not only using twins are raised </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

35
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:14.174
<v Speaker 1>but twins raised apart showing that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't due to the fact of sharing a </v>

36
00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.004
<v Speaker 1>stimulating environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say there was an environmental </v>

37
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.370
<v Speaker 1>aspect of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the remaining 40 percent,</v>

38
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.700
<v Speaker 1>some of those error of measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of it is due to environment,</v>

39
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.200
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the shared where we go the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shared environment shared in the family.</v>

40
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.210
<v Speaker 1>It's due to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.810
<v Speaker 1>a non shared environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means your friends,</v>

42
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.913
<v Speaker 1>peers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your unique life experiences that you </v>

43
00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:42.464
<v Speaker 1>have the other people in your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't share with other people in </v>

44
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:45.734
<v Speaker 1>your family.</v>

45
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.353
<v Speaker 1>We can surmise that the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular gene has been found to be </v>

46
00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:56.390
<v Speaker 1>related to sensation seeking a dope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>

47
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>receptive Jane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that it's been there a long time.</v>

48
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually they estimate that it's not old</v>

49
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:04.571
<v Speaker 1>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe 50,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100,000</v>

51
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:09.870
<v Speaker 1>years old in our species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.253
<v Speaker 1>this particular Jane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there may be other genes that are </v>

53
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:15.960
<v Speaker 1>older even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see this another,</v>

54
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.883
<v Speaker 1>the point is you see what we might call </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensation sick analogs of sensation </v>

55
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>seeking behavior and other species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

56
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:28.201
<v Speaker 1>a lot of my work has compared sensation </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking a expressions exploration,</v>

57
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.403
<v Speaker 1>novel approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the novelty and other species with the </v>

58
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:35.374
<v Speaker 1>same explored this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the extent that they have the same </v>

59
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>biological roots and Helen's and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>other species.</v>

60
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.250
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look at evolution.</v>

61
00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:45.084
<v Speaker 1>We have a modern test of evolution when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can find something that exists in </v>

62
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>humans and earlier species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly primates,</v>

63
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.693
<v Speaker 1>but also even in rats when you can find </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and it's linked to the same </v>

64
00:03:58.331 --> 00:03:59.164
<v Speaker 1>biological indicators in both species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in both humans and other animals that </v>

65
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>indicates that has a revolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

66
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more than a merely analogy,</v>

67
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this looks like what we do,</v>

68
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.653
<v Speaker 1>but it's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that the fact that it looks like </v>

69
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>sensation seeking and has the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological roots,</v>

70
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I would say the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.350
<v Speaker 1>the age differences are somewhat larger </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking at the extremes.</v>

72
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say like it like about 60,</v>

73
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.403
<v Speaker 1>65.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A male would have half the sensation </v>

74
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:40.660
<v Speaker 1>seeking store that he had when he was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his late teens,</v>

75
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.930
<v Speaker 1>early twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty much of a decline.</v>

76
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the male female differences are constant</v>

77
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:49.640
<v Speaker 1>across age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.853
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

79
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.943
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps not as large as when we talk </v>

80
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:56.420
<v Speaker 1>about sex differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:57.254
<v Speaker 1>and traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're always talking about a lot of </v>

82
00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 1>overlap for you about population </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>

83
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 1>So people always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know someone who is a female,</v>

84
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's very high sensation seeking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

85
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's variation within both genders.</v>

86
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Just the overall population differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
