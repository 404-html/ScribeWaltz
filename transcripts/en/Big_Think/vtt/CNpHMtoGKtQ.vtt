00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.500
<v Speaker 1>We focus on the</v>

2
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.250
<v Speaker 2>and a turmoil when we focus on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>places where we're bombs are going off,</v>

3
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure this will be remembered as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a golden age.</v>

4
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Another thing just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was 1994,</v>

5
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.980
<v Speaker 2>around 90 to 94 when the Internet</v>
<v Speaker 2>started to take off.</v>

6
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 2>It's only been a little bit more than a</v>
<v Speaker 2>decade.</v>

7
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 2>We almost can't imagine a time when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't communicate for free with</v>

8
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 2>anybody in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet that's the world we're living in</v>

9
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:40.310
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

10
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

11
00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:42.610
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's truly a golden age and the,</v>

12
00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 2>in the sense that the world has become</v>

13
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.640
<v Speaker 1>single place.</v>
