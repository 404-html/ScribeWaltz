00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's easy to create a straw man</v>

3
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:11.130
<v Speaker 2>to attack game theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 2>and if you literally think that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>payoffs are you written down are</v>

5
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:17.530
<v Speaker 2>completely right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.820
<v Speaker 2>and that the other play and all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>players are identical,</v>

7
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will come up with a really stupid</v>

8
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:23.270
<v Speaker 2>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.113
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

10
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.950
<v Speaker 2>this leading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

11
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.740
<v Speaker 2>and that I think is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

12
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 2>is a poor application of gain through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's also why we call the book the</v>

13
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:32.210
<v Speaker 2>Rd strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.100
<v Speaker 2>there is a science behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's used,</v>

15
00:00:36.101 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 2>uses a dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's providing a common language so that</v>

16
00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 2>we understand the reason why we think</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody is going to take this strategy</v>

17
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:46.890
<v Speaker 2>is because they see all of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>different options playing out in this</v>

18
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you agree with that?</v>

19
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Where is our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our conclusion falls from our</v>

20
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 2>assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we can understand,</v>

21
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.260
<v Speaker 2>do we have a common set of assumptions?</v>

22
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 2>But this article pointed out something</v>
<v Speaker 2>else that I think is even more</v>

23
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's multiple levels of game</v>

24
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I like to think of us as metagame</v>

25
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.113
<v Speaker 2>theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

26
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 2>or it's not just about solving a</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular game.</v>

27
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 2>It's about making sure you're playing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right game.</v>

28
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.850
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

29
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 2>now how do you go about designing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>game?</v>

30
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 2>And you could think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can change the rules of the game.</v>

31
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.710
<v Speaker 2>You can change the players in the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can change the payoffs in the game.</v>

32
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 2>You can link one game to another game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need to understand some game</v>

33
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:33.240
<v Speaker 2>theory to figure out when I'm doing my</v>
<v Speaker 2>game design,</v>

34
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 2>are these changes likely to help me or</v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to hurt me?</v>

35
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 2>And I think in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be so precise to say</v>

36
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be 7.36,</v>
<v Speaker 2>5% improvement,</v>

37
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 2>but it's a good idea to link these two</v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiations.</v>

38
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 2>What isn't a good idea to link these two</v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiations?</v>

39
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 2>And that's the level at which I think we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be</v>

40
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.460
<v Speaker 1>very helpful.</v>
