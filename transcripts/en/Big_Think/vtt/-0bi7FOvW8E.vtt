1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.153
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have progressed in the gay rights </v>

3
00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:12.240
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we haven't progressed as a result of</v>

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.120
<v Speaker 2>government policies are certainly not </v>
<v Speaker 2>leadership at the federal level.</v>

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.390
<v Speaker 2>I think what's remarkable is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress we've made,</v>

6
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:19.224
<v Speaker 2>despite the opposition from the federal </v>
<v Speaker 2>government or some of the state </v>

7
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 2>governments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would have been unthinkable to me.</v>

8
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:28.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm 44 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two weeks ago when I was growing up,</v>

9
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:30.300
<v Speaker 2>I would've thought impossible for gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to marry.</v>

10
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Now we have it in many states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including in some of the most remarkable</v>

11
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:35.604
<v Speaker 2>states that you could actually be </v>
<v Speaker 2>pronounced husband and husband and wife </v>

12
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:41.540
<v Speaker 2>and wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get buried in Dubuque Buca.</v>

13
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 2>You can't get married in Chelsea or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>San Francisco.</v>

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.133
<v Speaker 2>Frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that we've made progress in </v>

15
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 2>places like that and Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts,</v>

16
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.783
<v Speaker 2>New Hampshire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that speaks volumes about the </v>

17
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:53.574
<v Speaker 2>power and the dynamism and the gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights community that we see still the </v>

18
00:00:56.501 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 2>federal government officials mumble when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes to questions around gay rights,</v>

19
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.130
<v Speaker 2>that these are not equal rights of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ordinary American citizens.</v>

20
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.900
<v Speaker 2>We saw the Obama administration submit </v>
<v Speaker 2>this brief in the,</v>

21
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.190
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

22
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.153
<v Speaker 2>to defend the defense of marriage act </v>
<v Speaker 2>and indefensible piece of law that was </v>

23
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:17.530
<v Speaker 2>signed by President Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

24
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.833
<v Speaker 2>shows you that in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>democrats can sometimes not be a lot </v>

25
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:24.990
<v Speaker 2>better than Republicans and some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>key civil rights,</v>

26
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:25.824
<v Speaker 2>civil liberties issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here you had the Obama </v>

27
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:28.314
<v Speaker 2>administration filed this brief </v>
<v Speaker 2>defending the law in some of the most </v>

28
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 2>disgusting rhetoric and language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

29
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.803
<v Speaker 2>I understand the fact that justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>department has to defend the laws </v>

30
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:39.144
<v Speaker 2>enacted by Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way they did so in that brief </v>

31
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 2>was really offensive to many gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lesbian people across this country.</v>

32
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that they had such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>teenager that they couldn't realize that</v>

33
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:48.894
<v Speaker 2>the way they were going to defend this </v>
<v Speaker 2>law was going to be in a way that would </v>

34
00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 2>really infuriate gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lesbian people are across the country.</v>

35
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.713
<v Speaker 2>Who thought that we had embarked upon a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very different time in our nation's </v>

36
00:01:59.041 --> 00:01:59.874
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's great that President </v>

37
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 2>Obama actually says the words gay and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lesbian.</v>

38
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.483
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was notable that the Naacp </v>

39
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.433
<v Speaker 2>Convention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talked about gay people still know </v>

40
00:02:07.991 --> 00:02:08.824
<v Speaker 2>having to civil rights and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>great that he had this ceremony </v>

41
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 2>commemorating the 40th anniversary of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stonewall at the White House,</v>

42
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.673
<v Speaker 2>but frankly talk is cheap and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>only so long that a very eloquent and </v>

43
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:22.074
<v Speaker 2>very thoughtful and very charismatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>president will be able to get away on </v>

44
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:26.970
<v Speaker 2>talk alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankly,</v>

45
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:27.804
<v Speaker 2>the policies and the outcomes and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions of that government has to </v>

46
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 2>measure up to the talk that both led him</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the White House.</v>

47
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 2>And that is still allowing him to lead </v>
<v Speaker 2>the public in very significant ways.</v>

48
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.663
<v Speaker 2>At one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all turned off for when people's </v>

49
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 2>actions don't measure up to their words.</v>

50
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.453
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone legitimately can </v>

51
00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:52.211
<v Speaker 2>say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't ask,</v>

52
00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 2>don't tell us worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the wife of the author of that,</v>

53
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the terrible policy,</v>

54
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 2>a rat on a campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a mistake to put,</v>

55
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:01.474
<v Speaker 2>don't ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't tell in place that you created a </v>

56
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 2>witch hunt in the military that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be gay.</v>

57
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 2>You just can't ask about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell anyone about it.</v>

58
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 2>But if you tell someone or someone asks </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

59
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 2>then you could still be pushed out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the military.</v>

60
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

61
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They promise to,</v>

62
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.341
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to undo.</v>

63
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 2>Don't ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't tell.</v>

64
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 2>They are the bomb administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

65
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 2>but they're saying now that they will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll get to it and they're sweet.</v>

66
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.910
<v Speaker 2>They're sweet old time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

67
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 2>it's really quite different if you're an</v>
<v Speaker 2>openly gay or lesbian,</v>

68
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 2>serving in the military and putting your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life on the line for our country,</v>

69
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.603
<v Speaker 2>and yet your government can discriminate</v>
<v Speaker 2>against you and you could lose your job </v>

70
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 2>even as you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lay down your life for your country.</v>

71
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 2>You could still be kicked out from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that posts or that,</v>

72
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 2>that position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And frankly there is no.</v>

73
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.020
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason why we ought to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

74
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.160
<v Speaker 2>it's not as if we're going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fix the economy or the healthcare or the</v>

75
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 2>environment or even these wars in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>near future.</v>

76
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 2>And that frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social change is not a sequential piece.</v>

77
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 2>This is not like your college </v>
<v Speaker 2>prerequisites.</v>

78
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:08.510
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take economics 100,</v>

79
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 2>one before you go to economics due to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh one.</v>

80
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.453
<v Speaker 2>Frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these issues all have to be dealt with </v>

81
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.463
<v Speaker 2>aggressively and the idea that we will </v>
<v Speaker 2>wait to deal with them just shows in </v>

82
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:19.144
<v Speaker 2>fact that they're not a huge priority </v>
<v Speaker 2>for this administration the way we had </v>

83
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:22.264
<v Speaker 2>hoped and that in the way that many had </v>
<v Speaker 2>voted for them to bring about that </v>

84
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:26.284
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find it remarkable that increasingly </v>

85
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 2>the Obama administration is is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustaining withering attacks,</v>

86
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 2>not just from civil libertarians about </v>
<v Speaker 2>human rights and civil liberties,</v>

87
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.890
<v Speaker 2>but from the gay community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the women's community,</v>

88
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.370
<v Speaker 2>from young people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the antiwar activist.</v>

89
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 2>We.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were the.</v>

90
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.870
<v Speaker 2>Those were the base that often created </v>
<v Speaker 2>the seedbed that got him elected and yet</v>

91
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:49.984
<v Speaker 2>some of the major issues that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>propelled so many young people and so </v>

92
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:53.284
<v Speaker 2>many different people to vote for this </v>
<v Speaker 2>president are now other ones that we </v>

93
00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:56.944
<v Speaker 2>find on the back burner I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually not a very good political </v>

94
00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:00.994
<v Speaker 2>agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't take a lot for a 25 year old </v>

95
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.323
<v Speaker 2>to become disenchanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once again with the political process </v>

96
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.833
<v Speaker 2>and you know frankly when when folks </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned out in record numbers and gave </v>

97
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:12.454
<v Speaker 2>record amounts of money is because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to see swift decisive change and </v>

98
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:17.794
<v Speaker 2>that has yet to come about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well certainly giving the full </v>

99
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 2>protection of health benefits to federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>government employees,</v>

100
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 2>which is not what he's done a would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>an important first step.</v>

101
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.050
<v Speaker 2>You're look at President Obama is like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>ceo of a major corporation,</v>

102
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

103
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.333
<v Speaker 2>It's just like as if you were the CEO of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walt Disney or apple and if you're </v>

104
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 2>concerned about the health and wellbeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your employees,</v>

105
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:40.803
<v Speaker 2>you want to protect them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to protect them and their </v>

106
00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:43.024
<v Speaker 2>families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is remarkable that this </v>

107
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 2>president has said that even though a </v>
<v Speaker 2>CEO,</v>

108
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.380
<v Speaker 2>the government workers of the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States of America,</v>

109
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.813
<v Speaker 2>that he won't provide healthcare </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits for same sex partners who work </v>

110
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 2>a for with the federal government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something he could do.</v>

111
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 2>That's something he ought to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankly.</v>

112
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.780
<v Speaker 2>If apple can get around to it or Nike </v>
<v Speaker 2>can get around to it and Walt Disney,</v>

113
00:06:06.781 --> 00:06:07.614
<v Speaker 2>you can get around to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the CEO of United States of </v>

114
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 2>America can get around to that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't need congress.</v>

115
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.620
<v Speaker 2>It could just implement that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

116
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 2>that was also another misstep on the gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights front.</v>

117
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.243
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you Adama you had the mumbling on don't </v>

118
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 2>ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't tell.</v>

119
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.713
<v Speaker 2>You had the lack of providing full </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare benefits for federal </v>

120
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:26.654
<v Speaker 2>government employees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People begin to scratch their heads and </v>

121
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:29.714
<v Speaker 2>wondering whether or not we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the type of change we were hoping </v>

122
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:32.894
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the type of change that the </v>

123
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 2>president can bring about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could also use the bully pulpit to be</v>

124
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 2>very clear around marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

125
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 2>the president has said in his books and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his public speaking,</v>

126
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 2>that he struggles with the idea around </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage for lesbian and gay people.</v>

127
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Not that hard a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly,</v>

128
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 2>we don't have the same protections as </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight people have.</v>

129
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.313
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is protected by the law of the </v>

130
00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.023
<v Speaker 2>presence protected by law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got two beautiful daughters and a </v>

131
00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 2>wonderful first lady who's his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the law protects their family,</v>

132
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>protects them from discrimination,</v>

133
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.940
<v Speaker 2>protects them in case anything were to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go wrong with either one of the parents,</v>

134
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.343
<v Speaker 2>gay people across this country don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the benefit of those legal </v>

135
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:11.684
<v Speaker 2>protections.</v>

136
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.033
<v Speaker 2>And no matter how much they say they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to treat us as equal citizens and </v>

137
00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 2>give us a full rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact is,</v>

138
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 2>unless you move and you implement on </v>
<v Speaker 2>those rights,</v>

139
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.670
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just rhetoric.</v>

140
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:25.160
<v Speaker 2>It's just a hortatory language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

141
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:26.150
<v Speaker 2>and frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

142
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.013
<v Speaker 2>the time has come for bold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decisive leadership and seen it in </v>

143
00:07:30.231 --> 00:07:32.630
<v Speaker 2>states all across this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankly,</v>

144
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts as married gay people now </v>
<v Speaker 2>for over a year and some months.</v>

145
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.873
<v Speaker 2>And the institution of marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any weaker and </v>

146
00:07:39.061 --> 00:07:40.730
<v Speaker 2>mess Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is that.</v>

147
00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:43.730
<v Speaker 2>It was three years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've seen it in Connecticut.</v>

148
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.410
<v Speaker 2>And frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decisive,</v>

149
00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Speaker 2>clear action from the federal </v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

150
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 2>I think is essential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unnecessary.</v>

151
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 2>And it's still a.</v>
