1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.680
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of talk nowadays about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psycho therapeutic use of psychedelics</v>

2
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 1>were kind of going through a psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 1>renaissance.</v>

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.320
<v Speaker 1>It's been a while since the 19 sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These substances have been repressed,</v>

4
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:14.660
<v Speaker 1>but mankind has been using and</v>
<v Speaker 1>experimenting with entheogenic or God</v>

5
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>facilitating substances for Millennia</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was a great essay written by</v>

6
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Timothy leary that I think is fabulous</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece and the sixties called programming</v>

7
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>the psychedelic experience in which he</v>
<v Speaker 1>defined the psychedelic experience as a</v>

8
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:31.851
<v Speaker 1>period of increased reactivity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stimuli both from within and from</v>

9
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>without.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this increased</v>

10
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.590
<v Speaker 1>suggestibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like we.</v>

11
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.470
<v Speaker 1>We dissolve the boundaries and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>filters that keep us from sort of being</v>

12
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>flooded by sense impressions and so one</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it kind of delicate suggestible</v>

13
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you wouldn't want to be like driving</v>

14
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>or having to worry about crossing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street with a red light or a green light</v>

15
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>when you're tripping.</v>

16
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>But the psychotherapeutic use of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a state of increased suggestibility</v>

17
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>is that if you pattern the input</v>
<v Speaker 1>signals,</v>

18
00:00:57.121 --> 00:00:59.840
<v Speaker 1>if you sequence and control what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjected to,</v>

19
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>subject it to during this period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>heightened sensibility to stimuli.</v>

20
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.340
<v Speaker 1>You could ski or awareness towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful spaces of mind.</v>

21
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.670
<v Speaker 1>You could navigate that evanescent flux</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sensation and perception that Eric</v>

22
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Davis says is all we have and all we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards places of ecstatic illumination.</v>

23
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.470
<v Speaker 1>The idea being that you could grab</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody and give them some high grade</v>

24
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>medical cannabis and then lead them on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hike as they listened to the inception</v>

25
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.640
<v Speaker 1>soundtrack and you could kind of curated</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness.</v>

26
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>You could steer the emotional direction</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people go to.</v>

27
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>We are mediated beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are our thought,</v>

28
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 1>our our sense of self is mediated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

29
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 1>It's mediated by environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mediated by culture and it's</v>

30
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:46.170
<v Speaker 1>mediated by technologies like cinema and</v>
<v Speaker 1>music and so on and so forth.</v>

31
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>But we also are thick skinned beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the times we close ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He a capitation makes us less sensitive</v>

33
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>to stimuli,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the mediation.</v>

34
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.410
<v Speaker 1>And so we create higher resolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies,</v>

35
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four k cameras,</v>

36
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.670
<v Speaker 1>imax movie theaters to create a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense mediation that can,</v>

37
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 1>that can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can scramble our defense mechanisms</v>

38
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 1>and take us towards these useful spaces</v>
<v Speaker 1>of static illumination.</v>

39
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Childlike sense of wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so on and so forth,</v>

40
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>but those external mediation</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies need to be accompanied by</v>

41
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Speaker 1>internal mediation technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why turns Mckenna used to say</v>

42
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:18.780
<v Speaker 1>computers are drugs and drugs are</v>
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>

43
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.610
<v Speaker 1>so we need technologies of inner space</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go along with the technologies of the</v>

44
00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:26.970
<v Speaker 1>outer space and the two of them together</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think are pretty cool because they</v>

45
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>allow us to experiment with awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with consciousness and to kind of script</v>

46
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>or pattern subjectivity.</v>

47
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Eric Davis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite writers is the guy</v>

48
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:39.420
<v Speaker 1>who talks about this notion that what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with with these new media</v>

49
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they be higher resolution imax</v>

50
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>screens or psychedelic substances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we're trying to engage the technical</v>

51
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:52.971
<v Speaker 1>material of subjectivity itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interiority.</v>

52
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to harness and pattern</v>
<v Speaker 1>interior experience.</v>

53
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>We're scripting first person awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like we become the director</v>

54
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>of our own movie from our own Pov and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to take it towards the place that we</v>

55
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get to experience the kind of</v>

56
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>evanescent sense of sensation that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>want and that that ideas.</v>

57
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's totally out there,</v>

58
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>but how cool is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

59
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.171
<v Speaker 1>it's this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

60
00:03:16.171 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it reminds me of that movie with Arnold</v>

61
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Schwartzenegger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a total recall where you're able to kind</v>

62
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:24.170
<v Speaker 1>of become someone else by implanting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

63
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 1>the whole unfolding phenomenological</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

64
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.520
<v Speaker 1>and so this notion that we could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could basically turn our minds inside</v>

65
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could pattern the human imagination</v>

66
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 1>and sort of turn ourselves into anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want and experience any possible</v>

67
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just something that sounds,</v>

68
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds amazing to me.</v>
