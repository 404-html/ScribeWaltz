1
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.370
<v Speaker 1>If your honor has this unique ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really take you there.</v>

2
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something I've been trying to do.</v>

3
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and traditional still images and</v>

4
00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:17.620
<v Speaker 1>documentary film and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

5
00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>and those mediums have have great power</v>
<v Speaker 1>to influence.</v>

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>But I was always frustrated with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inability to really take a first person</v>

7
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>subjective experience and let someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it for themselves.</v>

8
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:35.211
<v Speaker 1>And vr can start to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can place people into worlds that they</v>

9
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:40.731
<v Speaker 1>may never otherwise see and experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>something firsthand in a way that is</v>

10
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:46.911
<v Speaker 1>very different than watching a film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You recall it as a memory instead of I</v>

11
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>saw a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually was there in this experience.</v>

12
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>And so those memories actually encode in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

13
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a stronger way.</v>

14
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.540
<v Speaker 1>And I think that allows us to reflect</v>
<v Speaker 1>and process them in a,</v>

15
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a more personal way.</v>

16
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an emotional connection,</v>

17
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get as close to being in their</v>

18
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>position as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not completely a first person</v>

19
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's some testing and research</v>

20
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>around that where it could be actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>embody someone else that's a little bit</v>

21
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Speaker 1>harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But right now we know we can bet least</v>

22
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>be very close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you are very close to someone</v>

23
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>and you're seeing what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing,</v>

24
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>you start to internalize that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>these mirror neurons that we can feel</v>

25
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>what other people are feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that reflection that I think is</v>

26
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:43.701
<v Speaker 1>invoked from these powerful experiences</v>
<v Speaker 1>can start to foster empathy,</v>

27
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the other.</v>

28
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.320
<v Speaker 1>And it can dissolve your own ego and</v>
<v Speaker 1>help you take the perspective of someone</v>

29
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this special ability of Vr</v>

30
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.420
<v Speaker 1>is really important for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

31
00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:02.700
<v Speaker 1>the urgent crises that we're facing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

32
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.760
<v Speaker 1>especially climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can be hard to dig into,</v>

33
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:12.951
<v Speaker 1>to really lean into because it seems so</v>
<v Speaker 1>big and abstract and um,</v>

34
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 1>but when you are experiencing climate</v>
<v Speaker 1>change right in the places that,</v>

35
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

36
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:22.470
<v Speaker 1>it's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like it's,</v>

37
00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>it's here that you're getting this</v>
<v Speaker 1>glimpse into the future of a world of</v>

38
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:29.060
<v Speaker 1>extreme weather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

39
00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>of dried out desert conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of refugees,</v>

40
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.580
<v Speaker 1>of pristine ecosystems collapsing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>being destroyed.</v>

41
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.380
<v Speaker 1>And so when you can actually experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>these events as if you were there,</v>

42
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 1>you internalize them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that starts to lead to this</v>

43
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>process of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

44
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:52.470
<v Speaker 1>am I participating in it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I consuming fossil fuels that I don't</v>

45
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>need to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I divest from some of the industries</v>

46
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.790
<v Speaker 1>that are responsible for this crisis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that reflection is really</v>

47
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:07.861
<v Speaker 1>important because it leads to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or as necessary to lead to action in</v>

48
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>one's own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a whole threshold of</v>

49
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>different actions one can take to engage</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

50
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

51
00:03:16.771 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>this incredible environmental problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're facing.</v>

52
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>this chain of events I think can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>triggered,</v>

54
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a singular,</v>

55
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 1>powerful experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so with this medium,</v>

56
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>we can convey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>not just information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can convey emotional fidelity in a</v>

58
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>way that we haven't been able to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

59
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with such clarity.</v>

60
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.980
<v Speaker 1>And so we can really feel what it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a mother in the deserts of</v>

61
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Somalia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.830
<v Speaker 1>trying to find food for her children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having to flee to the outskirts of</v>

64
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>cities into huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.010
<v Speaker 1>camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

66
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and seeing that they're really just</v>

67
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>trying to care for their families just</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we would do if we were there.</v>

68
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 1>And so I think it has this ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help us,</v>

69
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>invoke the empathy that we all have and</v>

70
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>cultivate the compassion and the action</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is needed to address so many of the</v>

71
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>world's problems.</v>
