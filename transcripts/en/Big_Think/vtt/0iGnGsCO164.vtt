1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the history of our industry,</v>

2
00:00:01.891 --> 00:00:02.724
<v Speaker 1>there have been some real major events </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have transformed the industry and </v>

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.243
<v Speaker 1>had a huge impact in our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The invention of the integrated circuit </v>

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.493
<v Speaker 1>really opened up a huge number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities to do things that were </v>

5
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>unimaginable back then than the creation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the personal computer.</v>

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>The PC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a huge impact on our lives,</v>

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>not only in our own personal lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the way industry conducted itself</v>

8
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>and how they use computers to do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that were important to them.</v>

9
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Then the third thing was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduction.</v>

10
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they internet,</v>

11
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean that Internet with pcs and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated circuit.</v>

12
00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>You can see how old that is building and</v>
<v Speaker 1>and changing the world.</v>

13
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.103
<v Speaker 1>I believe that the next step is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be what's called cognitive computing </v>

14
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.123
<v Speaker 1>because technology has changed so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have not so much power in our </v>

15
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:50.724
<v Speaker 1>computing capability and so much memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can store that we're able for </v>

16
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:55.824
<v Speaker 1>the first time to actually create </v>
<v Speaker 1>products that begin to mimic how the </v>

17
00:00:59.041 --> 00:00:59.874
<v Speaker 1>brain works and what that means is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the product can actually on a very </v>

18
00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly expertise,</v>

19
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>could be as narrow as let's say weather </v>
<v Speaker 1>forecasting for example,</v>

20
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>or something very narrow that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>product begins to learn.</v>

21
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I see these youths in and in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means he has some cognitive capability,</v>

22
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.643
<v Speaker 1>so the more you use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better it becomes at a particular </v>

23
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:23.364
<v Speaker 1>function to the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually gets to a point where he </v>

24
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>begins to actually ask questions of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

25
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Think of it as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when a child is born a,</v>

26
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:35.640
<v Speaker 1>their brain is empty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>begins to get filled with stuff.</v>

27
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.893
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully mostly good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to a point in time </v>

28
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 1>when the child touches a hot plate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother says hot,</v>

29
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>then the child knows from then on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time somebody says hot,</v>

30
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.043
<v Speaker 1>he better be careful because now his </v>
<v Speaker 1>program in his brain and he's learning </v>

31
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.410
<v Speaker 1>continues to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there comes that time in the child's</v>

32
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.303
<v Speaker 1>life that all of us that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents either dread or look forward to </v>

33
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:04.210
<v Speaker 1>is when the child starts asking why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.020
<v Speaker 1>when you do something and say why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

35
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.883
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and where the child is doing is </v>

36
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:09.354
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>

37
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.283
<v Speaker 1>He now has enough cognitive capability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand enough of what's going on </v>

38
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.890
<v Speaker 1>but not enough so that he laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

39
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.143
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the same way these circuits get to a </v>

40
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>point where actually they begin to query</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and say,</v>

41
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>I need more information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me more information.</v>

42
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Tell me about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

43
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>there are some experiments going today </v>
<v Speaker 1>on healthcare,</v>

44
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.893
<v Speaker 1>in oil exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in financial transactions where they </v>

45
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>actually begin to tap the power of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive computing.</v>

46
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.793
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to enter an era of that's </v>

47
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.103
<v Speaker 1>unimaginable today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in some ways is kind of exciting to </v>

48
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>think of the fact that we could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by intelligence that helps us</v>

49
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>make our lives better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also somewhat frightening.</v>

50
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:53.844
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that you're now surrounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>by intelligence that begins to think </v>

51
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>they know more than you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

52
00:02:58.141 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>but we're moving to that direction.</v>

54
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.703
<v Speaker 1>I see it happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're about 10 years away from </v>

55
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>that being a real commercial reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

56
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:08.164
<v Speaker 1>the work I've seen done in healthcare in</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil exploration and financial </v>

57
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 1>transactions tells me that this thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very real.</v>

58
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 1>And I'll give you one small example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how powerful it can be.</v>

59
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>A cannot disclose the names of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

60
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:23.194
<v Speaker 1>but in one particular example is they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at the data on a particular </v>

61
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:29.460
<v Speaker 1>medicine that was used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.493
<v Speaker 1>to treat patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way things had been done up to </v>

63
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>now is you get a medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get FDA approval,</v>

64
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.023
<v Speaker 1>and then you put it out and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>collect data and about 10 years later </v>

65
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:40.830
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take the medicine off the</v>

67
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 1>market because it's causing some major </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

68
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.393
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they took an example like that and </v>

69
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's pretend that we had this cognitive</v>

70
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>capability back then and fitted the data</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we had and see what happens.</v>

71
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this actually cognitive machine was able</v>

72
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:04.771
<v Speaker 1>to predict within a matter of weeks of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the product being on the market,</v>

73
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.103
<v Speaker 1>what took 10 years of collecting data so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see how powerful something like </v>

74
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:12.934
<v Speaker 1>that could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he does is because the </v>

75
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.663
<v Speaker 1>computing capabilities so fast and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of memory so large in a very </v>

76
00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:24.760
<v Speaker 1>narrow segment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can do what let's say 10,000</v>

77
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:25.594
<v Speaker 1>people would do if you could get them </v>
<v Speaker 1>all together in one room to look at one </v>

78
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it is,</v>

79
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 1>I see this to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.190
<v Speaker 1>as a next revolution in technology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>will impact everything that we do.</v>
