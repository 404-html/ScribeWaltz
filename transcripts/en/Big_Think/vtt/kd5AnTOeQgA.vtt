00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.980
<v Speaker 1>I think the media today is the temple</v>
<v Speaker 1>mess.</v>

2
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all sound bytes.</v>

3
00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:14.570
<v Speaker 1>It's all sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all confrontation.</v>

4
00:00:14.571 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 1>It's all absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phony reality shows high.</v>

5
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.360
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to have an intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse that loss any amount of time</v>

6
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 1>where someone can actually ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

7
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:27.530
<v Speaker 1>you can answer them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can ask a followup question,</v>

8
00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 1>you can answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can actually get the brain opening</v>

9
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:35.420
<v Speaker 1>and closing and moving around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>digesting this material and dwelling on</v>

10
00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:36.254
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>

11
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.600
<v Speaker 1>what can you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And five words,</v>

12
00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:40.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you sum this up?</v>

13
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 1>So at Peta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have become gimmicky.</v>

14
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.090
<v Speaker 1>We have become sex obsessed ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

15
00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:50.360
<v Speaker 1>we use naked women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We use scantily close people.</v>

16
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do whatever we need to do to take</v>

17
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:58.901
<v Speaker 1>this serious message and try to get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the media mind.</v>

18
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.990
<v Speaker 1>And that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard these days because the old</v>

19
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>days of the serious</v>

20
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>
