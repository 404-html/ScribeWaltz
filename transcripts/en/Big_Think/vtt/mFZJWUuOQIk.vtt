1
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Well actually surveys I have seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate about 40% of scientists believe</v>

2
00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:13.671
<v Speaker 1>in a god to whom one may pray an</v>
<v Speaker 1>expectation of an answer that's not a</v>

3
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:15.290
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>who went off after con creating the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe and did something else.</v>

5
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:20.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a god who's interested in human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

6
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:22.520
<v Speaker 1>40%,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.610
<v Speaker 1>would adhere to that statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The numbers are smaller when you ask</v>

8
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>members of the National Academy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sciences and just various reasons people</v>

9
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:34.830
<v Speaker 1>have proposed why so called elite</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists have an even lower proportion</v>

10
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 1>of believers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as devastatingly absent</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the scientific community as people</v>

12
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>might assume based on the fact that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouncements they hear coming from</v>

13
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:51.831
<v Speaker 1>scientists are usually more in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>skeptical or even atheistic perspective.</v>

14
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 1>I think whether or not a scientists are</v>
<v Speaker 1>believers,</v>

15
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should not have a whole lot to do with</v>

16
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>how they conduct science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that I am a believer as far as</v>

17
00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm aware of has had very little</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence on my scientific work.</v>

18
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's important to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>that distinction.</v>

19
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>If I'm asking a scientific question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the tools of science I should be</v>

20
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>using.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not assuming that something</v>

21
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:20.880
<v Speaker 1>supernatural happened in the test tube</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that moment.</v>

22
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:25.881
<v Speaker 1>And that would explain my data point a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do think people of faith and people</v>

23
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>who don't have faith are capable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughtful,</v>

24
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.440
<v Speaker 1>ethical decision making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So any notion that we are becoming less</v>

25
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:38.070
<v Speaker 1>ethical as scientists because of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>diminution and religious faith,</v>

26
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I think has to be actually countered by</v>
<v Speaker 1>a arguments to say that as sense of</v>

27
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:47.250
<v Speaker 1>ethical behavior is not a distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>to just to people who are in fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in spiritual matters.</v>

29
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not sure,</v>

30
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it would diminish the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hostilities which are bad for our</v>

31
00:01:56.971 --> 00:02:01.971
<v Speaker 1>culture if more scientists were in fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to stand up and say that faith</v>

32
00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>and science need not to be in conflict.</v>

33
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Because right now that's a minority view</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't get heard very much.</v>

34
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>And it's apparent to some people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were having more of a cultural war,</v>

35
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.760
<v Speaker 1>a war that seems to imply that some</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldview needs to win and some</v>

36
00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>worldview needs to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would not want to look forward to a</v>

37
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:27.531
<v Speaker 1>culture where science lost and religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>faith became the dominating force.</v>

38
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:30.480
<v Speaker 1>For Truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would not want to live in a culture</v>

39
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>where faith lost and science with all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>its reductionism and it's materialism</v>

40
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:39.000
<v Speaker 1>became the sole source of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we need both kinds of truth.</v>

41
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:43.440
<v Speaker 1>We need both kinds of world views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the extent that scientists can help</v>

42
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.840
<v Speaker 1>with that realization of the duel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.480
<v Speaker 1>ways of finding answers to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate kind of questions that each</v>

44
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>worldview can ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think that would be a good thing.</v>

45
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Certainly sociobiologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>have put forward arguments that religion</v>
<v Speaker 1>could have an evolutionary basis that we</v>

47
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:10.441
<v Speaker 1>humans are designed in a certain way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look for agency behind actions that we</v>

48
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>don't understand and that may then</v>
<v Speaker 1>relate to a why various cultures.</v>

49
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:20.401
<v Speaker 1>Over time I have identified something</v>
<v Speaker 1>mysterious and supernatural outside of</v>

50
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>their own experience to try to explain</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that didn't otherwise have an</v>

51
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's too simple a to basically</v>

52
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that does it.</v>

53
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is true.</v>

54
00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Our God is not true either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is real.</v>

55
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Our God is not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a matter of whether you can</v>

56
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>explain it away by a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is what's the real answer?</v>

57
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>And I think far too few people have kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of looked at the question from that</v>

58
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:48.550
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the evidence for the idea that</v>

59
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>God exists or doesn't exist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think anyone who's looked at that</v>

60
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 1>would conclude that the strong atheist</v>
<v Speaker 1>position of saying,</v>

61
00:03:56.441 --> 00:04:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I know there is no god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not an easy one to sustain.</v>

62
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.653
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

63
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>it basically implies a certain degree of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hubris and arrogance to say that I know</v>

64
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 1>so much that I could exclude any</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of there being a god.</v>

65
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evidence will never draw people to</v>

66
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:15.700
<v Speaker 1>the conclusion of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know confidently there is a god.</v>

67
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Maybe God didn't intend it to be that</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy.</v>
