1
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.250
<v Speaker 1>So some identities</v>

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 2>are those philosophies would say</v>
<v Speaker 2>determined it simple determinable,</v>

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 2>so somewhere like race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.320
<v Speaker 2>in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the racial system is laid out so that</v>

6
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 2>you have to be of either a mixed race or</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the races and you can't be,</v>

7
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 2>as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black and an Asian at the same time.</v>

8
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:28.500
<v Speaker 2>You can be mixed race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't be straightforwardly Asian</v>

9
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 2>and straightforward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be black at the same time.</v>

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in that sense that mutual exclusivity</v>

11
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 2>is built into the structure of some</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of identity,</v>

12
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.990
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing in general about</v>
<v Speaker 2>identities that excludes the overlap of</v>

13
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 2>different forms of identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of gender and race and sexual</v>

14
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 2>orientation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion and nationality in class or in</v>

15
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 2>a single person that indeed most people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have all of these things.</v>

16
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.493
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

17
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.883
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

18
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's a sensible thought about how to</v>

19
00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:58.561
<v Speaker 2>deal with them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

20
00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this relates to what the proper</v>

21
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 2>answer to the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

22
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your identity is usually in a</v>

23
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 2>context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty clear which aspects of your</v>

24
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other ones that are relevant.</v>

25
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 2>If I'm at a meeting of the American</v>
<v Speaker 2>Philosophical Association,</v>

26
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.683
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

27
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 2>my identity as a philosopher is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>

28
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 2>but if I go to a meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

29
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.021
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

30
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:21.670
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

31
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.503
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

32
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 2>a church group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably isn't.</v>

33
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.160
<v Speaker 2>And so I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

34
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.360
<v Speaker 2>I know without thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

35
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 2>often what the relevance is of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>dimensions of my identity.</v>

36
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.970
<v Speaker 2>So when people get into trouble with us</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because they think that one dimension</v>

37
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 2>of identity makes a demand on them</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's inconsistent with the demand made</v>

38
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.210
<v Speaker 2>by some other dimension of their ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are sort of two</v>

39
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.170
<v Speaker 2>helpful guiding thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is,</v>

40
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>morality is helpful here.</v>

41
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.300
<v Speaker 2>That is to say there are general</v>
<v Speaker 2>obligations.</v>

42
00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:05.510
<v Speaker 2>We have two other people independent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their identities and our identities.</v>

43
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.640
<v Speaker 2>We better make sure that we discharged</v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

44
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:10.850
<v Speaker 2>First of all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you find yourself being pulled</v>

45
00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:13.100
<v Speaker 2>into dementia directions by your</v>
<v Speaker 2>identities,</v>

46
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.650
<v Speaker 2>if you find yourself being pulled in one</v>
<v Speaker 2>direction,</v>

47
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.610
<v Speaker 2>say as a Serb and in the other direction</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a Christian,</v>

48
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.510
<v Speaker 2>it might be helpful to remember that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a human being and that you have</v>

49
00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 2>obligations to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

50
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.340
<v Speaker 2>that are not connected with whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're being with your Serb or</v>

51
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

52
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.850
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morality helps morality,</v>

53
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.250
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which defines what we owed to everybody,</v>

54
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.590
<v Speaker 2>irrespective of their identities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the second thing is that sometimes we</v>

55
00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:43.100
<v Speaker 2>do have to make choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of what it is to make human</v>

56
00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

57
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.490
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the way in the balance.</v>

58
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to go here with my religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity or am I going to go here with</v>

59
00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:54.740
<v Speaker 2>my racial identity in this particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>context?</v>

60
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Or am I going to try and find some way</v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

61
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 2>The two unthought of to bring them</v>
<v Speaker 2>together without that strong tension and</v>

62
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 2>people are doing this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can sound very difficult in theory,</v>

63
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 2>but I know my model for this really was</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father.</v>

64
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.580
<v Speaker 2>My father wasn't a santee and a and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>patriot of the Santee,</v>

65
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 2>a Ghanaian and a patriot of Ghana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

66
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 2>he wrote an autobiography called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>autobiography of an African Patriot</v>

67
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 2>because he was a Pan Africanist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

68
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 2>he was a devout methodist and very</v>
<v Speaker 2>active in his church and cared about his</v>

69
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 2>church and he was a citizen of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

70
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.620
<v Speaker 2>He was ambassador to the UN for awhile</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he worked very much an international</v>

71
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.840
<v Speaker 2>affairs.</v>

72
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 2>He cared about relations among nations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you might think,</v>

73
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 2>how can you be a loyal Isanti and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>loyal Ghanaian after all the Santa is a</v>

74
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 2>kingdom in the middle of the Republic of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ghana?</v>

75
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer is,</v>

76
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at my father's life as it were.</v>

77
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 2>And look at lots of lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do this sort of thing all the</v>

78
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be a loyal citizen of Texas and</v>

79
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 2>a loyal American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally they'll pull you in</v>

80
00:03:57.191 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 2>different directions and then you have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>choice to make,</v>

81
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 2>but much of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

82
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.020
<v Speaker 2>being Texas texts and there's got to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>what matters for some purposes.</v>

83
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 2>And being American is what matters for</v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

84
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 2>And when they do come into conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have many things to appeal to to</v>

85
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 2>help you resolve the conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including,</v>

86
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 2>I think your own sense of the relative</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight in your own life,</v>

87
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 2>which is up to you of your state</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity as opposed to your national</v>

88
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't tell people you can't.</v>

89
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 2>These are things that have people have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out for themselves.</v>

90
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there is no morally correct,</v>

91
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 2>uncertain though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethically pre given answer to the</v>

92
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's more important,</v>

93
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.690
<v Speaker 2>tax and or American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's more important,</v>

94
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

95
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 2>in a Christian or philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things are not.</v>

96
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.950
<v Speaker 2>You have to figure it out for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all you can say to people in</v>

97
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.690
<v Speaker 2>trying to be helpful is that</v>

98
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

99
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.010
<v Speaker 2>you're often going to have people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>share one of these identities with you,</v>

100
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.080
<v Speaker 2>make demands of you on that basis that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're entitled to resist in the name of</v>

101
00:05:04.081 --> 00:05:08.070
<v Speaker 2>your more of morality and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the name of a human human identity,</v>

102
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.760
<v Speaker 2>but also in the name of other identities</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have and what you don't share</v>

103
00:05:11.761 --> 00:05:13.560
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody,</v>

104
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.670
<v Speaker 2>if you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

105
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.890
<v Speaker 2>I worked at the other day that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>really need to have 32 properties,</v>

106
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to consider any 32 properties to elect</v>

107
00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:29.001
<v Speaker 2>to have a set of bundles of properties</v>
<v Speaker 2>such as everybody in the world can have</v>

108
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.870
<v Speaker 2>a distinct and unique bundle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bundle the properties because two to</v>

109
00:05:33.871 --> 00:05:36.900
<v Speaker 2>the 32 is bigger than 6 billion or 6</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion of us.</v>

110
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a.</v>

111
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.610
<v Speaker 2>So even in the smallest village,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

112
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 2>There are both men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all the other identities are inflect,</v>

113
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.800
<v Speaker 2>are potentially inflected by gender and</v>
<v Speaker 2>among the women,</v>

114
00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:56.270
<v Speaker 2>some have more resources than others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some are married and some are married,</v>

115
00:05:56.271 --> 00:06:00.120
<v Speaker 2>some have children don't have children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these affect how their lives</v>

116
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 2>looked at them and how they get to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>the balance of these things in their</v>

117
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:06.540
<v Speaker 2>lives and the sort of the key thought of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the liberal tradition.</v>

118
