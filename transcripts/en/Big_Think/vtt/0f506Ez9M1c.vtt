1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.143
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

3
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.640
<v Speaker 1>How does one define simplicity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good question.</v>

4
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me it is just,</v>

5
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a distilled thought,</v>

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that registers quickly.</v>

7
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.133
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't require a lot of </v>

8
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:33.770
<v Speaker 1>explanations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems intuitively obvious,</v>

9
00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:35.510
<v Speaker 1>that kind of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

10
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.593
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of businesses out there tend to </v>

11
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:43.540
<v Speaker 1>put things in terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.580
<v Speaker 1>that require more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more fought study or whatever.</v>

13
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:49.694
<v Speaker 1>And I think what made steve jobs is such</v>
<v Speaker 1>a genius was that he had this belief in </v>

14
00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:54.704
<v Speaker 1>the power of simplicity and he wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ensure that his products embodied that </v>

15
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>and the way the company communicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people embodied that.</v>

16
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.913
<v Speaker 1>So I think simplicity is this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a concept really that gets applied </v>

17
00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:15.230
<v Speaker 1>to so many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just,</v>

18
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the simple product.</v>

19
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:18.284
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the whole structure of the </v>

20
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:21.854
<v Speaker 1>organization as the belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff is based on this idea </v>

21
00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:29.510
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that human beings have,</v>

22
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a built in desire for simpler things.</v>

23
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.860
<v Speaker 1>We just don't like to Labor over complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

24
00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:41.000
<v Speaker 1>And when someone has something to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to share with us,</v>

25
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.160
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a product or service or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

26
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:47.900
<v Speaker 1>that the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who really understand that simplicity is</v>

27
00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>a very powerful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the people who,</v>

28
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:54.830
<v Speaker 1>who establish an emotional connection </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their customers,</v>

29
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.700
<v Speaker 1>which is something that apple was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good at doing.</v>

30
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.140
<v Speaker 1>I do think that simplicity is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardest things you can do.</v>

31
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.280
<v Speaker 1>And it is deceptive in that way because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks simple.</v>

32
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.893
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I like to put it is that there </v>

33
00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:16.154
<v Speaker 1>is no such thing as simplicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is only the perception of </v>

34
00:02:18.831 --> 00:02:21.680
<v Speaker 1>simplicity that every simple thing we </v>
<v Speaker 1>see in this world,</v>

35
00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:22.514
<v Speaker 1>whether it's an iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously years worth of research goes </v>

36
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:28.220
<v Speaker 1>into making the little things that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>an iphone.</v>

37
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.000
<v Speaker 1>But you could look at a simple website </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

38
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.043
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know we who create such things </v>

39
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>know that this beautifully simple site </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've,</v>

40
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.640
<v Speaker 1>you've built could have been the result </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

41
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.270
<v Speaker 1>of weeks or months of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of anguish,</v>

42
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.450
<v Speaker 1>debate and differences of opinion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments and whatever.</v>

43
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.200
<v Speaker 1>And you end up with something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>

44
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 1>So what's really important is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception of simplicity.</v>

45
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did have,</v>

46
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>if someone walks away from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and that it was simple,</v>

47
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>mission accomplished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think getting there is really,</v>

49
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:10.681
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It requires all that commitment and uh,</v>

50
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.040
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

51
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't come easily.</v>

52
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you do get there,</v>

53
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:20.940
<v Speaker 1>it becomes very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very worth it.</v>

54
00:03:20.941 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a great steve jobs quote,</v>

55
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>it's always about Steve Jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>

56
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 1>where he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot of hard work to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>something simple,</v>

58
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth it in the end because </v>
<v Speaker 1>once you get there,</v>

59
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.053
<v Speaker 1>you can move mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think those are great words to </v>

60
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:40.340
<v Speaker 1>live by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he understood that that was the,</v>

61
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.263
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the challenge for apple was to take </v>

62
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 1>really cool products and really cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>capabilities and put them in a,</v>

63
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.620
<v Speaker 1>in a form that people could so easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>relate to and,</v>

64
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>and take advantage of without thick </v>
<v Speaker 1>manuals and that kind of a thing.</v>

65
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.860
<v Speaker 1>So that's the real work is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is making great things simple.</v>

66
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 1>The big question is how do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does simplicity come from?</v>

67
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's a question I hear all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

68
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I have some humble suggestions on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>topic.</v>

70
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.593
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because simple is such a simple </v>

71
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:21.784
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes along with some simple advice </v>

72
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.053
<v Speaker 1>and I think that one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important things you can do is simply </v>

73
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.523
<v Speaker 1>step back and look at your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing through the eyes of </v>

74
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>the customer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that that was Steve Jobs,</v>

75
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.843
<v Speaker 1>amazing strength that he looked at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that apple was creating and </v>

76
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 1>he looked at it with a super critical </v>
<v Speaker 1>eye.</v>

77
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>What would he think as a customer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that a lot of,</v>

78
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>company leaders don't do that as well as</v>

79
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:54.814
<v Speaker 1>Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can criticize your own </v>

80
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 1>products and services and your website </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that stuff.</v>

81
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.793
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can excuse your own lapses by </v>

82
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

83
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:08.254
<v Speaker 1>well we did the best we could because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>had these certain issues and that's how </v>

84
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>we dealt with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the difference between,</v>

85
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a regular person in a steve jobs,</v>

86
00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>kind of a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve was just,</v>

87
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no compromises allowed.</v>

88
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>And if you suggest to me that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to compromise,</v>

89
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your future here is probably not very </v>

90
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:27.154
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believed that the user experience </v>

91
00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:32.440
<v Speaker 1>with all important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I always tell people,</v>

92
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best place to start for me is to </v>

93
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:39.310
<v Speaker 1>just be the customer and look at every </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the customer experience from the</v>

94
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:42.310
<v Speaker 1>very first ad they might see to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>website,</v>

95
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:45.070
<v Speaker 1>to what the retail experiences like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:48.040
<v Speaker 1>how hard it is to order when you get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>product,</v>

97
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 1>what does it feel like to open it up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>start experiencing it.</v>

98
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.850
<v Speaker 1>And the then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the design of the product,</v>

99
00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:56.900
<v Speaker 1>the interface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

100
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>when you need help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

101
00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.133
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how easy is it to get support the whole </v>

102
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:01.424
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you create this experience that is </v>

103
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:07.700
<v Speaker 1>simple for people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fails to,</v>

104
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to confuse them in a very,</v>

105
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:11.504
<v Speaker 1>very good way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

106
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at all the choices some people </v>

107
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 1>provide to their customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

108
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all the best intentions,</v>

109
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:23.150
<v Speaker 1>you might go to a website and there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>20 different products to choose from.</v>

110
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.013
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a company that really believes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in simplicity might say here are three </v>

111
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 1>and we've thought it all out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three kinds of people here.</v>

112
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:31.221
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:34.070
<v Speaker 1>the small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medium and large or whatever it is.</v>

114
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.383
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that make it easy for you to make a </v>

115
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>decision rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

116
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>force you to think too hard and then </v>

117
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.943
<v Speaker 1>wonder after you made the purchase </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you might've made a big mistake </v>

118
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 1>and that kind of a thing.</v>

119
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.820
<v Speaker 1>So I think apple again has been very </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at,</v>

120
00:06:48.821 --> 00:06:52.850
<v Speaker 1>at doing that kind of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's customers go away feeling pretty</v>

121
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:56.060
<v Speaker 1>confident that they got the right thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they enjoy the experience.</v>

122
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 1>But all along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these decisions that must be made,</v>

123
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.363
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be looked at with that kind of </v>

124
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.390
<v Speaker 1>brutal bit of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

125
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:06.224
<v Speaker 1>self analysis that is the experience so </v>
<v Speaker 1>good that you would actually tell your </v>

126
00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:14.600
<v Speaker 1>friends about it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to look at this thing with me.</v>

127
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:15.434
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this thing and you're going to </v>

128
00:07:16.191 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 1>like it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it just kind of like,</v>

129
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.770
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

130
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.050
<v Speaker 1>I'd buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

131
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.943
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if I'd tell anyone about </v>

132
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:24.020
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

133
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

134
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Speaker 1>it worked for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of a thing.</v>

135
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.583
<v Speaker 1>And I think in the world of Steve Jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was always about making the </v>

136
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:34.760
<v Speaker 1>experience like amazingly good.</v>

137
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.683
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and too many people are willing to </v>

138
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:42.410
<v Speaker 1>compromise that away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simplicity requires that kind of,</v>

139
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.393
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that brutal assessment of what is </v>

140
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.593
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good versus what's good enough </v>

141
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 1>and what's good enough isn't good </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

142
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.600
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>

143
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're mister simplicity.</v>

144
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.710
<v Speaker 1>What about your personal life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As simple as that?</v>

145
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is not at all really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm working on it,</v>

146
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.520
<v Speaker 1>but I think simplicity is something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>works in business and it should work and</v>

147
00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:11.870
<v Speaker 1>your personal life as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

148
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:17.500
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a gratifying way to live and work.</v>

149
00:08:18.471 --> 00:08:19.304
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something very </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfying about having this kind of </v>

150
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:28.970
<v Speaker 1>space in your life and the order and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of clutter and the,</v>

151
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:31.910
<v Speaker 1>and the firm direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

152
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>life is complicated and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's because life is complicated.</v>

153
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.960
<v Speaker 1>That's simplicity stands out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we got to take the good with the bad.</v>

154
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in this complicated world,</v>

155
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:43.123
<v Speaker 1>but that actually gives us an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to be more noticed by being </v>

156
00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:49.550
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whether it's business or personal,</v>

157
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simplest,</v>

158
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.190
<v Speaker 1>he has that kind of power.</v>

159
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>
