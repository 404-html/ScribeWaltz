1
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.260
<v Speaker 1>One of the classic definitions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindfulness is that it helps us not</v>

2
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.750
<v Speaker 1>cling to what's pleasant and not condemn</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is unpleasant.</v>

3
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.250
<v Speaker 1>So an example would be if you're driving</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York City and someone cuts you</v>

4
00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:30.620
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:35.621
<v Speaker 1>that's unpleasant and one would</v>
<v Speaker 1>instinctively have an angry response.</v>

6
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.890
<v Speaker 1>But that's happening all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you have an angry response too</v>

7
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you become a nightmare yourself.</v>

8
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.890
<v Speaker 1>So what mindfulness is teaching is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stimulus,</v>

9
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.420
<v Speaker 1>which is someone cutting you off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is different.</v>

10
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.450
<v Speaker 1>It's distinct from your emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction to that thing.</v>

11
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.870
<v Speaker 1>So someone could cut you off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could feel the anger,</v>

12
00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:06.920
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to act on the anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of being driven by your</v>

13
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:11.510
<v Speaker 1>reactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a little bit of a of room where</v>

14
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:13.850
<v Speaker 1>you can choose to be a different kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

15
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.930
<v Speaker 1>So mindfulness basically helps us</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerate,</v>

16
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

17
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aspects of the external world and</v>

18
00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:27.050
<v Speaker 1>the internal world that otherwise are</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to face.</v>

19
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.460
<v Speaker 1>There are basically two kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation.</v>

20
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.340
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a concentration practice.</v>

21
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.900
<v Speaker 1>You focus your attention on a neutral</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensation,</v>

22
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Speaker 1>like the feeling of the breath coming in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and out of the nostrils or uh,</v>

23
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.870
<v Speaker 1>like the repetition of a sound or what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>called a mantra.</v>

24
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.270
<v Speaker 1>And every time the mind wanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you notice that it's wandered,</v>

25
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>that might be five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes later when you're lost in</v>

26
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:02.660
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at a certain point you realize,</v>

27
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not watching the breath anymore.</v>

28
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Then you bring your mind back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>breath.</v>

29
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.960
<v Speaker 1>That's called a concentration or a one</v>
<v Speaker 1>point in practice.</v>

30
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

31
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning level of mindfulness.</v>

32
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.490
<v Speaker 1>When you really start practicing</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindfulness,</v>

33
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.650
<v Speaker 1>instead of bringing the mind back every</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to a central object,</v>

34
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.070
<v Speaker 1>you let the attention go wherever the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind goes.</v>

35
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.320
<v Speaker 1>So instead of paying attention just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the breath or the mantra,</v>

36
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 1>you pay attention to sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pay attention to thoughts,</v>

37
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.290
<v Speaker 1>you pay attention to feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pay attention to memories.</v>

38
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:45.320
<v Speaker 1>You pay attention to worries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to anxieties,</v>

39
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:48.080
<v Speaker 1>to anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to joy.</v>

40
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:52.070
<v Speaker 1>You pay attention to whatever passes</v>
<v Speaker 1>through your mind moment to moment.</v>

41
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.590
<v Speaker 1>And then what you start to see is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

42
00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:57.730
<v Speaker 1>everything is changing all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

43
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn to pay attention more to</v>

44
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>process then to content.</v>

45
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>It's really only in the past 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 years that the medical establishment</v>

46
00:03:12.291 --> 00:03:15.350
<v Speaker 1>has been exposed at all to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindfulness is.</v>

47
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.020
<v Speaker 1>And for 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 of those years,</v>

48
00:03:18.021 --> 00:03:22.490
<v Speaker 1>it was like just a new age thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was on the periphery and only through</v>

49
00:03:22.491 --> 00:03:23.670
<v Speaker 1>the work of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.090
<v Speaker 1>a couple of people like John Kabat Zinn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.770
<v Speaker 1>has mindfulness come into the medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment.</v>

52
00:03:30.771 --> 00:03:33.230
<v Speaker 1>And there are a lot of studies that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>being done now,</v>

53
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are showing the benefit of</v>

54
00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:41.090
<v Speaker 1>mindfulness for all kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.080
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some old colleagues of mine,</v>

56
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have done some very good work showing</v>

57
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 1>that the steady practice of mindfulness</v>
<v Speaker 1>light up areas of the brain that have to</v>

58
00:03:56.091 --> 00:04:01.091
<v Speaker 1>do with modulating emotional reactivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

59
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.170
<v Speaker 1>so I think there's beginning evidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

60
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.260
<v Speaker 1>the brain is plastic more plastic than</v>
<v Speaker 1>we initially thought.</v>

61
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.960
<v Speaker 1>And that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.900
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you feed into the brain actually</v>

63
00:04:17.901 --> 00:04:22.340
<v Speaker 1>changes the architecture of the brain so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's possible to promote,</v>

64
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.700
<v Speaker 1>to develop the areas of the brain that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there,</v>

65
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for kindness,</v>

66
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for altruistic feeling.</v>

67
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for the regulation of difficult</v>

68
00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:33.860
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>
