1
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.210
<v Speaker 1>I would like to make a distinction in</v>
<v Speaker 1>say between age zero to about 15 or 16</v>

2
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:14.391
<v Speaker 1>years before I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I came in touch with a woman</v>

3
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 1>called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we called [inaudible] in my secondary</v>

4
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>school in Kenya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the time after that,</v>

5
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I met sister as is</v>

6
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>the Islam of my family was not</v>
<v Speaker 1>political.</v>

7
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not remember either my father or my</v>

8
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 1>mother saying that a society has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.730
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sharia should be the rule of a,</v>

10
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>of a country or a society with one</v>
<v Speaker 1>exception.</v>

11
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>In the one year that we were in Saudi</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabia,</v>

12
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Speaker 1>there was no distinction between a</v>
<v Speaker 1>secular sphere and,</v>

13
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.143
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

14
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the film of series a in the</v>

15
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>form of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of God,</v>

16
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.880
<v Speaker 1>these white intertwined in Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the one year that we were in</v>

17
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lived according to Sharia and the</v>

18
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 1>state was run through Islamic law.</v>

19
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.690
<v Speaker 1>So the beheadings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

20
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.000
<v Speaker 1>amputations every Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stonings,</v>

21
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a distinction,</v>

22
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when atrocities in Somalia were carried</v>

23
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:34.010
<v Speaker 1>out by a secular dictatorships that has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as Muhammad [inaudible],</v>

24
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.690
<v Speaker 1>my mother would denounce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>condemn those atrocities.</v>

25
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>But when atrocities were carried out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state of Saudi Arabia,</v>

26
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Speaker 1>thieves who are amputated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's heads were cut off.</v>

27
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>That was sharia law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was something that the victim</v>

28
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>deserved because he violated the law of</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

29
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>But we left that behind us in when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>left Saudi Arabia and went into</v>

30
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My life in Ethiopian,</v>

31
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>in Kenya until my 16th year was I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>just see,</v>

32
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>praying five times a day.</v>

33
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>It was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Islam was there socially and</v>

34
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:18.111
<v Speaker 1>culturally it wasn't a political issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I meet in 1985 sisters is a</v>

35
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>different kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam is introduced and different</v>

36
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>meaning also from the one I knew from my</v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

37
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.750
<v Speaker 1>it was a political Islam.</v>

38
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>It was very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an individual choice.</v>

39
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.600
<v Speaker 1>It was about what she referred to as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inner she had struggling to simply to</v>

40
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>meet the obligations to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you play five times instead of three</v>

41
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:44.670
<v Speaker 1>times or two times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

42
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the Ramadan days,</v>

43
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.790
<v Speaker 1>all 30 of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not half a day I say used to do or a</v>

44
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>week in a month or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just adhering to the rules every</v>

45
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rules that allow that have permitted</v>

46
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.190
<v Speaker 1>and trying to abstain from what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harambe or what is forbidden.</v>

47
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.170
<v Speaker 1>This is reinforced within the Somali</v>
<v Speaker 1>community because Kenya is a very</v>

48
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>multicultural place and societies it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as Somali but in the Somali space</v>

49
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>they were fingers like this man we call</v>
<v Speaker 1>it buffalo song.</v>

50
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
<v Speaker 1>He will fast for a hundred days and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced the same kind of radical</v>

51
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.530
<v Speaker 1>political all consuming Islam that</v>
<v Speaker 1>divides the world into we and they and</v>

52
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:41.341
<v Speaker 1>the division started within the Islamic</v>
<v Speaker 1>community so we were those of us who</v>

53
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>followed the foods rigidly.</v>

54
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Those other Muslims who are neglectful</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the rules were considered to be non</v>

55
00:03:49.071 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Muslims hypocrites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had all sorts of negative attributes</v>

56
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 1>for them and then that they extended to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the non Muslims.</v>

57
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 1>My grandmother represented what's we</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally generally would call</v>

58
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.950
<v Speaker 1>traditional nomadic Somali life and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>values of that tradition,</v>

59
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 1>mainly tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much we oriented clan oriented.</v>

60
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:19.690
<v Speaker 1>She taught me my blood line because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is your,</v>

61
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot survive without your</v>

62
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>bloodline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

63
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>she taught us all these anecdotes about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to survive in the desert,</v>

64
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 1>which animals to fear which animals are</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to fear which animals to hunt and</v>

65
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

66
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.260
<v Speaker 1>she was very superstitious when I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>ill or my sister got ill,</v>

67
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 1>she had no access or knowledge of modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine.</v>

68
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.880
<v Speaker 1>So she dealt with the challenges in life</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the seasons,</v>

69
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 1>with droughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she had superstitious</v>

70
00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:52.690
<v Speaker 1>explanations for it.</v>

71
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.090
<v Speaker 1>She was a Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a very different Muslim than for</v>

72
00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:00.020
<v Speaker 1>instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sees as the sisters Caesar,</v>

73
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.430
<v Speaker 1>how Islam was very much diluted with her</v>
<v Speaker 1>own cultural,</v>

74
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional superstitions.</v>

75
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

76
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.220
<v Speaker 1>she thought it was a good thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrate the birthday of the Prophet</v>

77
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.053
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

78
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 1>which later at sisters isn't vocal song</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say that was a bad thing to do.</v>

79
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could not read the Koran.</v>

80
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.010
<v Speaker 1>She had land a few verses by heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just enough to pray.</v>

81
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.560
<v Speaker 1>But she didn't allow us to put the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Qur'an on the ground.</v>

82
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>She would make us kiss the Qur'an and</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts it on her the highest surface and</v>

83
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:35.140
<v Speaker 1>faster cleaner has before we touch the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

84
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.670
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was just more of a traditional</v>

85
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Somali nomadic</v>
<v Speaker 1>value system.</v>

86
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>With respect to Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should make a distinction between</v>

87
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Muslims and Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslims as individual human beings like</v>

88
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>you and me can be influenced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not born.</v>

89
00:05:56.201 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not a genetic discrepancy to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim.</v>

90
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 1>You are just an individual human being</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can be persuaded to change your</v>

91
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so engage in critical thinking and</v>

92
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.380
<v Speaker 1>change the course of your life is alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like Nazis.</v>

93
00:06:14.881 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Him today is a very violent</v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian,</v>

94
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 1>the dangerous doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the sooner we see it,</v>

95
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.853
<v Speaker 1>the better.</v>

96
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.540
<v Speaker 1>It depends on where they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are in Europe or in America,</v>

97
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.960
<v Speaker 1>you'll have access to so much education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much empirical evidence that you can</v>

98
00:06:38.021 --> 00:06:40.720
<v Speaker 1>change your own life if you do certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

99
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.340
<v Speaker 1>I would say to Muslims living in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>West,</v>

100
00:06:45.341 --> 00:06:47.500
<v Speaker 1>take advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully advantage of that.</v>

101
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop your mind and your faculties of</v>

102
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.510
<v Speaker 1>critical thinking and look around you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why are we here?</v>

103
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Cheyenne answered that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm millions of Muslims leaving</v>

104
00:06:59.261 --> 00:07:03.220
<v Speaker 1>their own home countries and seeking a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better life in the west.</v>

105
00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:07.330
<v Speaker 1>What is it in the West that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing great but we are doing wrong if</v>

106
00:07:07.331 --> 00:07:11.710
<v Speaker 1>you are in Muslim countries than there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a difference that a welcome Muslim</v>

107
00:07:11.711 --> 00:07:14.530
<v Speaker 1>countries through oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solely citizens,</v>

108
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.060
<v Speaker 1>United Arab Emirates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kuwait and so on who can afford because</v>

109
00:07:19.061 --> 00:07:23.170
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to go about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't have to spend 90% of their time</v>

110
00:07:23.171 --> 00:07:26.590
<v Speaker 1>seeking brad like the poor neighborhoods</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Egypt.</v>

111
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that group can make a change and can</v>

112
00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:36.100
<v Speaker 1>bring in because we live in the age of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet and so on.</v>

113
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.580
<v Speaker 1>They can't translate progressive books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Enlightenment Command lots of ideas,</v>

114
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.870
<v Speaker 1>books here into Arabic and bring it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it to their own people.</v>

115
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reading the Koran,</v>

116
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.090
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very little to live on</v>

117
