1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:00.943
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.940
<v Speaker 2>That's an Obama administration has</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought about change.</v>

3
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that can be debated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is everything from the symbolic to</v>

4
00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:18.280
<v Speaker 2>the substantive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5
00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:21.910
<v Speaker 2>levels of what it would mean to have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>African American president.</v>

6
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.010
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.030
<v Speaker 2>I think at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there have been changes that were</v>

8
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.940
<v Speaker 2>unanticipated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that came as a consequence of his</v>

9
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.840
<v Speaker 2>presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when we talk about</v>

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.080
<v Speaker 2>the initial moment of his launch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

11
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 2>into as a national political figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was in that 2004 speech convention</v>

12
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:49.150
<v Speaker 2>speech in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

13
00:00:49.151 --> 00:00:50.980
<v Speaker 2>he began that by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

14
00:00:50.981 --> 00:00:55.420
<v Speaker 2>there's not a black America or white</v>
<v Speaker 2>America or a Latino America,</v>

15
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.430
<v Speaker 2>but there's the United States of</v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

16
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.000
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was entirely untrue.</v>

17
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were vastly different realities</v>

18
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.490
<v Speaker 2>that very often corresponded to race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least were significantly</v>

19
00:01:09.491 --> 00:01:12.460
<v Speaker 2>correlated with race and ethnicity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

20
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we've seen over the course of his</v>

21
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Speaker 2>two terms has been a</v>
<v Speaker 2>means by which our period in which it's</v>

22
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.890
<v Speaker 2>been increasingly visible.</v>

23
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the distinctions that we see,</v>

24
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as citizens based upon these elements of</v>

25
00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:31.690
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who we are.</v>

26
00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:32.524
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

27
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.060
<v Speaker 2>where we're from and what kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>communities we live in.</v>

28
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:37.780
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are racial ethnic background is,</v>

29
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.730
<v Speaker 2>those things would come to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>foreground.</v>

30
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think that you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly have anticipated the extent to</v>

31
00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:48.610
<v Speaker 2>which they have done so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when we look at,</v>

32
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter and how it emerged,</v>

33
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.061
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

34
00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:56.270
<v Speaker 2>it seemed kind of paradoxical that for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

35
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.110
<v Speaker 2>half a century African Americans had</v>
<v Speaker 2>been struggling,</v>

36
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically around the voting rights</v>

37
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:05.380
<v Speaker 2>act to get increased political electoral</v>
<v Speaker 2>representation.</v>

38
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 2>And at the point at which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

39
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.110
<v Speaker 2>were represented at the pinnacle of</v>
<v Speaker 2>American political power,</v>

40
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.530
<v Speaker 2>it reverberates and this kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>boomerang effect.</v>

41
00:02:14.531 --> 00:02:18.880
<v Speaker 2>And we wound up with a revitalized</v>
<v Speaker 2>grassroots movement of people who don't</v>

42
00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:21.580
<v Speaker 2>necessarily trust political power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are outside the</v>

43
00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 2>establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

44
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.830
<v Speaker 2>and people who were attempting to kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of move the levers of political power to</v>

45
00:02:26.831 --> 00:02:30.010
<v Speaker 2>the advantage of a disempowered</v>
<v Speaker 2>communities.</v>

46
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.940
<v Speaker 2>And one would have thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess in a kind of naive perspective</v>

47
00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:37.030
<v Speaker 2>on Barack Obama's presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have thought that those things</v>

48
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:39.820
<v Speaker 2>would not have been necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would not have been necessary.</v>

49
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Certainly some of his critics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

50
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.980
<v Speaker 2>bought that he was going to govern in</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a radical way that,</v>

51
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was going to be,</v>

52
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reparations handed out in the first week</v>

53
00:02:49.661 --> 00:02:51.670
<v Speaker 2>for African Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

54
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.960
<v Speaker 2>and he's been very moderate and centrist</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

55
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.120
<v Speaker 2>and often reluctant to directly engage</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues of race.</v>

56
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what some of frustration</v>
<v Speaker 2>who come from the younger generation of</v>

57
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:03.050
<v Speaker 2>activists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

58
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 2>and they took his moderation as being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

59
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 2>in some instances inadequate to the task</v>
<v Speaker 2>at hand.</v>

60
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's a lot that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>missing from the public conversation</v>

61
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 2>about race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we talk about race,</v>

62
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 2>we most often confronted as an emotional</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

63
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or this kind of</v>

64
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.280
<v Speaker 2>subject of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

65
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 2>social anxiety or something in which we</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

66
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

67
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.120
<v Speaker 2>we're really all the same and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a ridiculous idea that we separate</v>

68
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 2>ourselves in this way.</v>

69
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is true,</v>

70
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:47.401
<v Speaker 2>but it's also very facile way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>approaching that question because on a</v>

71
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 2>more fundamental level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>race is a mythology.</v>

72
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 2>But there's also a very useful myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the only way it's been able</v>

73
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:59.500
<v Speaker 2>to endure for as long as it has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly in the United States.</v>

74
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

75
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I mean by that is we look at things</v>

76
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 2>now when we talk about race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretend to say that</v>

77
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this level of mistrust or their</v>

78
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.070
<v Speaker 2>stereotypes or misunderstandings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

79
00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:20.160
<v Speaker 2>we have these problems and we should all</v>
<v Speaker 2>just look at each other as humans.</v>

80
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.640
<v Speaker 2>But the fact of the matter is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like slavery and segregation and</v>

81
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.960
<v Speaker 2>economic discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things happened willfully.</v>

82
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.540
<v Speaker 2>They weren't the result of a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>haphazard,</v>

83
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.140
<v Speaker 2>mistaken approaches to people who happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be different from you.</v>

84
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.890
<v Speaker 2>And so it means that we don't simply</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to dispel mythology.</v>

85
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.330
<v Speaker 2>It means we have to actually grapple</v>
<v Speaker 2>with people having concrete interests</v>

86
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.470
<v Speaker 2>that may be different than the interests</v>
<v Speaker 2>of other communities.</v>

87
00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.830
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not simply implicit bias in</v>
<v Speaker 2>policing that has resulted in</v>

88
00:05:01.471 --> 00:05:03.690
<v Speaker 2>disproportionate numbers as we saw in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ferguson.</v>

89
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.020
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't simply a matter of implicit</v>
<v Speaker 2>bias or stereotypes,</v>

90
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.010
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

91
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.600
<v Speaker 2>good intentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well intentioned individuals who</v>

92
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.520
<v Speaker 2>happened to have arrested or pulled over</v>
<v Speaker 2>more African Americans and whites.</v>

93
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.680
<v Speaker 2>We saw that there was an institutional</v>
<v Speaker 2>structural approach to particular</v>

94
00:05:25.681 --> 00:05:30.681
<v Speaker 2>communities that were being fleeced by a</v>
<v Speaker 2>police department.</v>

95
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.050
<v Speaker 2>And so we can find those kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamics again and again and again.</v>

96
00:05:34.051 --> 00:05:38.520
<v Speaker 2>And so when we talk about race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be much more intractable</v>

97
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.810
<v Speaker 2>than simply ridding ourselves of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

98
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.680
<v Speaker 2>maybe some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

99
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.670
<v Speaker 2>mistaken ideas that have rattled around</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our heads.</v>

100
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.400
<v Speaker 2>So sometime.</v>
