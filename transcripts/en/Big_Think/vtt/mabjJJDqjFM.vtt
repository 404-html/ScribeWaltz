1
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the west,</v>

2
00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:13.171
<v Speaker 1>generally we have a model of self where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the self is kind of like an avocado,</v>

3
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have a pit inside of us.</v>

4
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm the pit is ourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our essence,</v>

5
00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:23.170
<v Speaker 1>our identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a thing to which we must above all</v>

6
00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.140
<v Speaker 1>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very importantly,</v>

8
00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:31.141
<v Speaker 1>we've see that pit is unique so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything we do is we want to show to</v>

9
00:00:33.011 --> 00:00:35.140
<v Speaker 1>reflect that pitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflect that self,</v>

10
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>and we want it to be unique in Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people frequently have a Flexi self,</v>

11
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.490
<v Speaker 1>so it's a different kind of self and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a self that's oriented more to duty</v>

12
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.610
<v Speaker 1>then to rights for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

13
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.470
<v Speaker 1>and very importantly it is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does not have,</v>

14
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.830
<v Speaker 1>have a cultural mandate to be different</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to be unique.</v>

15
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.010
<v Speaker 1>People in the east are not all alike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.791
<v Speaker 1>so if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:02.590
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at my family like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>

18
00:01:02.591 --> 00:01:04.990
<v Speaker 1>every single person is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different.</v>

19
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.330
<v Speaker 1>And that is true of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout Asia,</v>

20
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference is not,</v>

21
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:11.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how different are we from each other?</v>

22
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.880
<v Speaker 1>The difference is how much significance</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we attach to that difference?</v>

23
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.760
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we think it's very important to,</v>

24
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.610
<v Speaker 1>to differentiate ourselves from others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you asked him to other</v>

25
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.340
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they're individuals,</v>

26
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they different?</v>

27
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Of course they are different for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

28
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.961
<v Speaker 1>For them it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

29
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>of course I'm different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would I make a big deal of that?</v>

30
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>and they think it is very peculiar that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the West that we feel that we must,</v>

32
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate ourselves from others</v>

33
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.930
<v Speaker 1>endlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the ways that we do that,</v>

34
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.560
<v Speaker 1>of course it's through choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Choice in the West is very,</v>

35
00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:49.810
<v Speaker 1>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is always making choices.</v>

36
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.070
<v Speaker 1>And honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alana,</v>

37
00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:52.990
<v Speaker 1>those choices make us a little anxious.</v>

38
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.610
<v Speaker 1>If you do a study where you are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in an empty room and you're</v>

39
00:01:57.611 --> 00:02:01.570
<v Speaker 1>making a choice and you come from a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>individualistic culture,</v>

40
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.000
<v Speaker 1>you actually show signs of a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

41
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:06.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every little choice that you make,</v>

42
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.020
<v Speaker 1>even in private because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's defining who you,</v>

43
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 1>who you are is a little loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel like they just choose one name</v>

44
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.290
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't have this overlay and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the reasons they feel that</v>

45
00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:23.350
<v Speaker 1>actually we are less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less free than they are,</v>

46
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they think that we're the ones,</v>

47
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.090
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of in this prison where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.150
<v Speaker 1>like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every moment we must define ourselves.</v>

49
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't that awful.</v>

50
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

51
00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:34.234
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course the way,</v>

52
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.780
<v Speaker 1>the way that we live and we feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:37.781 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to be freely electing to,</v>

54
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.690
<v Speaker 1>to live the way that we live.</v>

55
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so even when we're doing things</v>

56
00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:47.134
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.870
<v Speaker 1>taking care of the elderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

58
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to feel that we,</v>

59
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 1>that is an extension of our great love</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the nature of our being to be able</v>

60
00:02:58.781 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>to care of the elderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day I was having dinner with</v>

62
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 1>somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>I just don't feel that and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just very,</v>

64
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>very hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

65
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>So somebody from a more flexi self or</v>
<v Speaker 1>interdependent culture was say,</v>

66
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just your duty,</v>

67
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for them it's like,</v>

68
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they held their elderly parents,</v>

69
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>they just go take care of the elderly</v>
<v Speaker 1>parent because that's their judy.</v>

70
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>For them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really liberating.</v>

71
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just go do it and you don't expect</v>

72
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.650
<v Speaker 1>there to do expression of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>this is what people do from their point</v>
<v Speaker 1>of view.</v>

74
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 1>We have made things very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard for ourselves to demand that</v>

75
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everything should be an expression</v>

76
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 1>of our inner nature.</v>
