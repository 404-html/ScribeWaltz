00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Some people ask the question of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>good is math?</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.170
<v Speaker 1>What is the relationship between math</v>
<v Speaker 1>and physics?</v>

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes math leads,</v>

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.950
<v Speaker 1>sometimes physics leads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they come together because of</v>

5
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>course there's a use for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics.</v>

6
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 16 hundreds,</v>

7
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Isaac Newton ask a simple question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If an apple falls,</v>

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.820
<v Speaker 1>then does the moon also fall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is perhaps one of the greatest</v>

9
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:33.831
<v Speaker 1>questions ever asked by a member of</v>
<v Speaker 1>homosapiens since the 6 million years</v>

10
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>since we parted ways with the apes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If an apple falls,</v>

11
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>does the moon also fall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isaac Newton said yes,</v>

12
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.190
<v Speaker 1>the moon falls because of the inverse</v>
<v Speaker 1>square law sodas an apple.</v>

13
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.370
<v Speaker 1>He had a unified theory of the heavens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't have the mathematics to</v>

14
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>solve the falling moon problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did he do?</v>

15
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>He invented calculus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Calculus is a direct consequence of</v>

16
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>solving the falling moon problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

17
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:05.430
<v Speaker 1>when you learn calculus for the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

18
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.280
<v Speaker 1>what is the first thing you do it?</v>

19
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.290
<v Speaker 1>What's the first thing you do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>calculus?</v>

20
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>You calculate the motion of falling</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies,</v>

21
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly how Newton calculated</v>
<v Speaker 1>the falling moon,</v>

22
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.020
<v Speaker 1>which opened up celestial mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's a situation where math and</v>

23
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:23.480
<v Speaker 1>physics were almost co-joined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

24
00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Speaker 1>like Siamese twins born together for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very practical question,</v>

25
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>how do you calculate the motion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>celestial bodies?</v>

26
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Then here comes Einstein asking a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different question and that is what is</v>

27
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:40.401
<v Speaker 1>the nature and origin of gravity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein said that gravity is nothing</v>

28
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>but the byproduct of curves space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why am I sitting in this chair?</v>

29
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 1>A normal person would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting in this chair because</v>

30
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:52.530
<v Speaker 1>gravity pulls me to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Einstein said,</v>

31
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:52.851
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

32
00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

33
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as gravitational</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull.</v>

34
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.390
<v Speaker 1>The earth has curved this space over my</v>
<v Speaker 1>head and around my body.</v>

35
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>So space is pushing me into my chair.</v>

36
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.680
<v Speaker 1>So to summarize Einstein's theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity does not pull space pushes,</v>

37
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>but you see the pushing of the fabric of</v>
<v Speaker 1>space and time requires differential</v>

38
00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:20.250
<v Speaker 1>calculus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the language of curved surfaces,</v>

39
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>differential calculus which you learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fourth year of Calculus.</v>

40
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.850
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a situation where math and</v>

41
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>physics were very closely combined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this time math came first.</v>

42
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>The theory of curved surfaces came</v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

43
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Einstein took that theory of curved</v>
<v Speaker 1>surfaces and then imported it into into</v>

44
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>a physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we have string theory.</v>

45
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that 100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>math and physics parted ways.</v>

46
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Einstein proposed special</v>

47
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>relativity in 19 Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

48
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>that was also around the time of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>birth of topology,</v>

49
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>the typology of hyper dimensional</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects,</v>

50
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>spheres in 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>

51
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>26,</v>

52
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>whatever dimension you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So physics and mathematics parted ways.</v>

53
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Math went into hyperspace and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematicians said to themselves,</v>

54
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.243
<v Speaker 1>ah Ha.</v>

55
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Finally we have found an area of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics that has no physical</v>

56
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>application whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mathematicians pride themselves as being</v>

57
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love being useless.</v>

58
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a badge of courage being useless,</v>

59
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>and they said the most useless thing of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all is a theory of differential topology</v>

60
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>and higher dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 1>physics plotted along for many decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We worked out atomic bombs.</v>

62
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>We worked out stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we worked out laser beams,</v>

63
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.380
<v Speaker 1>but recently we discovered string theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>and string theory exists in 10 and 11</v>

64
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 1>dimensional hyperspace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

65
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 1>but these dimensions are super.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're super symmetric,</v>

66
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 1>a new kind of numbers that mathematician</v>
<v Speaker 1>has never talked about.</v>

67
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Evolve within string theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we call it,</v>

68
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 1>super string theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the mathematicians were floored,</v>

69
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.940
<v Speaker 1>they were shocked because all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden out of physics came new</v>

70
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 1>mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super numbers,</v>

71
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.480
<v Speaker 1>super topology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super tiff,</v>

72
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.510
<v Speaker 1>differential geometry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden we had supersymmetric</v>

73
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:27.511
<v Speaker 1>theories coming out of physics that then</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionized mathematics,</v>

74
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.560
<v Speaker 1>and so the goal of physics we believe is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find an equation,</v>

75
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>perhaps no more than one inch long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will allow us to unify all the</v>

76
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:41.791
<v Speaker 1>forces of nature and allow us to read</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind of God and what is the key to</v>

77
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 1>that one?</v>

78
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Didn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Equation Super Cemetery,</v>

79
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.420
<v Speaker 1>a cemetery that comes out of physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not mathematics and has shocked the</v>

80
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 1>world of mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see all this as pure mathematics</v>

81
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>and so the final resolution could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>that God is a mathematician,</v>

82
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.870
<v Speaker 1>and when you read the mind of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually have a candidate for the</v>

83
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 1>mind of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mind of God,</v>

84
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:12.331
<v Speaker 1>we believe is cosmic music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music of strings resonating through</v>

85
00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>11 dimensional hyperspace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the mind of God.</v>
