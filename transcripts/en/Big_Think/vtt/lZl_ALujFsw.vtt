1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.000
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people have positioned this</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate as,</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a battle between the tech industry</v>

3
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:09.060
<v Speaker 1>and the content industry and it's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>insider's game.</v>

4
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a bunch of rich guys playing around</v>
<v Speaker 1>with each other.</v>

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what we're talking about is,</v>

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the freedom to innovate.</v>

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a very profound and important</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

8
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.410
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the services that,</v>

9
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>that consumers across the web have come</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know and love.</v>

10
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are 800 million people using</v>

11
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 1>facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The future of those services is at risk</v>

12
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:37.410
<v Speaker 1>and so your use of the Internet is</v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened by this legislation.</v>

13
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>If the legislation passes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll mean that you will pay more for a</v>

14
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.660
<v Speaker 1>lot of the things that you've come to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>appreciate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.310
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that are much,</v>

17
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>much less expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beyond that,</v>

18
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>there's innovation and there's the pace</v>
<v Speaker 1>of innovation is slowing down the next</v>

19
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 1>facebook.</v>

20
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>The next novel service that consumers</v>
<v Speaker 1>would get really excited about is,</v>

21
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>is not gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

22
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons the Internet has</v>

23
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>produced such wonderful innovation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's been very inexpensive to start</v>

24
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>a company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Foursquare got to 100,000 users on</v>

25
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>$25,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's unheard of in an era before the</v>

26
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:18.990
<v Speaker 1>open source software that everybody uses</v>
<v Speaker 1>to build on top of and the distribution</v>

27
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:21.680
<v Speaker 1>platform called the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the end users pay for it.</v>

28
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:22.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all buy our,</v>

29
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:24.990
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our access to the Internet ourselves.</v>

30
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>And so no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

31
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>no supplier of content has to buy the</v>
<v Speaker 1>access the way they used to in the cable</v>

32
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so by lowering the cost of creating</v>

33
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>new new services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've dramatically increased the amount</v>

34
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>of innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

35
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foursquare is essentially started with</v>

36
00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:45.840
<v Speaker 1>three people and they were able to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 100,000 users with five or six</v>

37
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

38
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're going to have three people and</v>

39
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 1>a lawyer involved in all of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>startups because,</v>

40
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an investor,</v>

41
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:56.550
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be looking at these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first due diligence question</v>

42
00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>you're going to ask is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you clean?</v>

43
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Is there any risk associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>liability?</v>

44
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could uh,</v>

45
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.580
<v Speaker 1>one of these people come after you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could the attorney general come after</v>

46
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing that might infringe?</v>

47
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.010
<v Speaker 1>And the definitions in this legislation</v>
<v Speaker 1>are so vague that no matter how hard</v>

48
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>they try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to be able to give</v>

49
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>crisp answers to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it creates a huge amount of</v>

50
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we'll chill investment,</v>

51
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.080
<v Speaker 1>which will chill innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real irony here is if you had to</v>

52
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:28.560
<v Speaker 1>pick the content industries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>least favorite company,</v>

53
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>it probably be Google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening here is that Google has</v>

54
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>about 200 lawyers on staff today.</v>

55
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to affect them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll fight these guys,</v>

56
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>they have the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the lawyers,</v>

57
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>they'll just create a team and go fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys.</v>

58
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 1>But if you take a little search engine</v>
<v Speaker 1>startup like duck duck go,</v>

59
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 1>which hopes to compete with Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is innovating in novel ways and</v>

60
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 1>creating a new experience for consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have three people.</v>

61
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>If the fourth one has to be a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're never going to get there.</v>

62
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>And the last thing is to come back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this notion of the freedom to innovate</v>

63
00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>and why is that so important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a bunch of really difficult</v>

64
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>problems that we're facing over the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>few years.</v>

65
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>And politicians sometimes say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you spending time on,</v>

66
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.590
<v Speaker 1>on this issue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an arcane insider issue.</v>

67
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you think about the problems that</v>

68
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to solve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet isn't the problem.</v>

69
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just think about,</v>

70
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that no matter what,</v>

71
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go through a period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dislocation as the economy evolves into</v>

72
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 1>this more modern on this more modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>platform and people who are in their</v>

73
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 1>forties are going to have to rethink how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making living.</v>

74
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 1>They're probably going to have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>more dependent on themselves.</v>

75
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>There are going to have to find ways of</v>
<v Speaker 1>retraining themselves.</v>

76
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.210
<v Speaker 1>The way to do that is to use the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet to,</v>

77
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.740
<v Speaker 1>to make it possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the,</v>

78
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 1>the idea of retraining workers is done</v>
<v Speaker 1>as part of a government service through</v>

79
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>a government institution in the old</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial hierarchical bureaucratic</v>

80
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:55.030
<v Speaker 1>model of delivering the services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be phenomenally expensive.</v>

81
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>What we're seeing on the Internet is</v>
<v Speaker 1>really nifty education startups where</v>

82
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 1>peers are teaching peers how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

83
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.050
<v Speaker 1>how to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cost of that is a tiny fraction of</v>

84
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>the cost of the old industrial model of</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing these services.</v>

85
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.560
<v Speaker 1>So we need this medium to get us through</v>
<v Speaker 1>these really intractable problems.</v>

86
00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a little inside baseball</v>

87
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.190
<v Speaker 1>argument between two rich kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:25.450
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a threat to the foundation of the</v>

89
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in turn is a threat to the</v>

90
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:30.020
<v Speaker 1>innovation that we need to dig ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of these,</v>

91
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these really difficult problems.</v>
