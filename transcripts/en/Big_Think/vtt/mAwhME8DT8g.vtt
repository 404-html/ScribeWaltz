1
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think you will see also India,</v>

2
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 1>because it's a young country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.700
<v Speaker 1>more than 50 percent of the population</v>
<v Speaker 1>is below the age of uh,</v>

4
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>25.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 1>so I think you will see a more youthful</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

6
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.090
<v Speaker 1>a more exuberant in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a more matter of fact,</v>

7
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this culture is contributing already</v>

8
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 1>and will contribute even more to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth of housing.</v>

9
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young people buying homes.</v>

10
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll have a lot more cars on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roads,</v>

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
<v Speaker 1>a certainly a young population that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very gripped by technology changes and</v>

12
00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:02.841
<v Speaker 1>very open to everything that the digital</v>
<v Speaker 1>age or offers.</v>

13
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.680
<v Speaker 1>So I think we're going to see an India</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which certainly divides will still be</v>

14
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:13.370
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will see young urban Indians,</v>

15
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 1>very tech savvy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very connected to the urban cultures.</v>

16
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.080
<v Speaker 1>You will still have people living in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>villages in very traditional ways as</v>

17
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>they do today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that they will continue at</v>

18
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>least for the next 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

19
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

20
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:30.721
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we,</v>

21
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be,</v>

22
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I think at a different level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as we joke in India about how we</v>

23
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:37.590
<v Speaker 1>live in all the ages,</v>

24
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.410
<v Speaker 2>the Samsung.</v>
