1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.890
<v Speaker 1>The Internet of things is an idea that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been around for uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 10,</v>

3
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>15 years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the first time I heard about</v>

4
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:10.830
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>there was some discussion of a European,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:19.011
<v Speaker 1>appliance manufacturer who had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>refrigerator that was connected to the</v>

7
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:20.110
<v Speaker 1>network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

8
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

9
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

10
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:25.980
<v Speaker 1>the scenarios that were playing out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

11
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>we're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if the refrigerator was smart and</v>

12
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:33.840
<v Speaker 1>knew that the new enough to adjust</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperatures,</v>

13
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe it new enough to send a request or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a message to the manufacturer saying,</v>

14
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the compressor's going bad.</v>

15
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was Kinda the first time I had</v>

16
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>heard about this idea of connecting a</v>
<v Speaker 1>product to the network,</v>

17
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>a product that wasn't a traditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

18
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't something that we thought was</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be connected to the network</v>

19
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>are interconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that started to open up,</v>

20
00:00:57.751 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people's eyes,</v>

21
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I think to this idea.</v>

22
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may not have been the first</v>

23
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>theoretical time that it was discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the first time that I think</v>

24
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>popular media and culture started</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about this idea.</v>

25
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.290
<v Speaker 1>But for whatever reason that connected</v>
<v Speaker 1>refrigerator really didn't take off the</v>

26
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:17.310
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really didn't kind of explode,</v>

27
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we started hearing about the</v>

28
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>connected washing machine and the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of context.</v>

29
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that idea of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet of things then started to</v>

30
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>refine a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we heard about machine to machine</v>

31
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that instead of human to</v>

32
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.130
<v Speaker 1>machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so sort of a through a screen or through</v>

33
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 1>a web page or through our mobile phones</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>

34
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>that machines would talk to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

35
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:46.850
<v Speaker 1>so the idea of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

36
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.860
<v Speaker 1>a stock quote generating a message that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be sent to another machine that</v>

37
00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>might think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

38
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:54.690
<v Speaker 1>now I made need to make a trade.</v>

39
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>So the automated trading world or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>weather forecast that's reported online</v>

40
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.610
<v Speaker 1>triggering a message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>to another system that's going to adjust</v>
<v Speaker 1>stock levels.</v>

42
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>So this idea that machines might talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>one another without a human in between</v>

43
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>was sort of a refinement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of the Internet of things idea.</v>

44
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>And now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 1>over the last handful of years we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing more consumer facing,</v>

46
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and concepts.</v>

47
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>And products coming out that I think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>has regenerated interest in this,</v>

48
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 1>in this machine to machine</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

49
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.160
<v Speaker 1>So now we're hearing things about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>connected car and the connected</v>

50
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:36.040
<v Speaker 1>thermostat and the smart home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now that the,</v>

51
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>the consumer side of things is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is heating up,</v>

52
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>we're also asking ourselves from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>business perspective,</v>

53
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>what is the Internet of things for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>business maybe where you don't have a</v>

54
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 1>consumer product or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thing,</v>

55
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 1>a widget that you sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're a services company or bank.</v>

56
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>What does the Internet of things mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a business like that,</v>

57
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>particularly a services company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for,</v>

58
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.870
<v Speaker 1>for companies that aren't as a consumer</v>
<v Speaker 1>facing or product oriented,</v>

59
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.501
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more opportunity but more,</v>

61
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of clouds around what that,</v>

62
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>what the Internet of things means for</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

63
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 1>And I think that anything that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 1>that we think about that we estimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we,</v>

65
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>operate in the places we work in,</v>

66
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>people we work with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

67
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 1>we think about the effectiveness of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>

68
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>the effectiveness of our workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effectiveness of a warehouse,</v>

69
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>the effectiveness of routes that a truck</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes or that a forklift makes.</v>

70
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we make guesses about the right ways</v>

71
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to design a workspace or design a</v>

72
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 1>logistics path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>design and warehouse.</v>

73
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.150
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we use the idea of sensors to</v>

74
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 1>collect data about things that we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>just guessing about?</v>

75
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Before that we were estimating that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

76
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.530
<v Speaker 1>that we were sort of like using our gut</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

77
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>to design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we collect real data about</v>

78
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:06.901
<v Speaker 1>performance of people and places and</v>
<v Speaker 1>processes that can give us more insight</v>

79
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>into optimizing and evolving our designs</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the way our business works.</v>

80
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I call the Internet of</v>
<v Speaker 1>business things.</v>

81
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:19.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not the consumer facing stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the business stuff.</v>

82
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Most of the data we think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.811
<v Speaker 1>from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:26.350
<v Speaker 1>an enterprise perspective is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is sort of modular.</v>

85
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>It's transactional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

86
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a a call center call or it's a web</v>
<v Speaker 1>transaction or it's a sale or it's a a</v>

87
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.120
<v Speaker 1>quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

88
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.710
<v Speaker 1>or it's a piece of data about a product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

89
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 1>but the Internet of things we'll be</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating streams of data.</v>

90
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 1>So one of the analogies is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is how social media create streams of</v>

91
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've got tweets and we've got,</v>

92
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flows on our,</v>

93
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on our wall and such that are more</v>

94
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:54.580
<v Speaker 1>streams of information.</v>

95
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.110
<v Speaker 1>And so think about a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sensor that might be on a,</v>

96
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 1>on a door and a warehouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time the door opens,</v>

97
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:04.870
<v Speaker 1>the sensor records a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a door opening,</v>

98
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.160
<v Speaker 1>a time of day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>day of week.</v>

99
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it creates some other ambient</v>

100
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it records the temperature in the,</v>

101
00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>in the facility or it records how long</v>
<v Speaker 1>the door was open or whatever.</v>

102
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>So these are little bits of data that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are happening every time the door is</v>

103
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Speaker 1>open and that door might be open a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of times during an hour or a,</v>

104
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.930
<v Speaker 1>or a day or a week or a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's creating these streams of data</v>

105
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.900
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like that one piece of data</v>

106
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 1>might be that interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the trends and the patterns and</v>

107
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 1>things that we're looking for in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>data that may be what we're looking for.</v>

108
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>So I want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

109
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 1>how often is that room used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

110
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.920
<v Speaker 1>during the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the afternoon,</v>

111
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 1>certain days of the week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks of the month,</v>

112
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.351
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 1>months of the year to help me be more</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient about the way I staff people</v>

114
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:49.970
<v Speaker 1>in that office or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

115
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temperature or the cooling or the</v>

116
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>electricity that I feed to that part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

117
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my facility.</v>

118
00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>So that data that's created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these streams of data are,</v>

119
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 1>are sets of data that I may not already</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a,</v>

120
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a technology platform to process.</v>

121
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to process streams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

122
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.450
<v Speaker 1>So now I have to think about a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>architecture,</v>

123
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 1>a new way to process a stream of data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just a stream,</v>

124
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I have a hundred facilities that I</v>

125
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>have the sensors in and they're creating</v>
<v Speaker 1>these streams of data.</v>

126
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 1>So now I've got a a new challenge around</v>
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>

127
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>One of the challenges starts to feed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>link into the big data topic.</v>

128
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.420
<v Speaker 1>So as I'm collecting the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these individual sensor data points over</v>

129
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 1>hundreds or thousands or tens of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of sensors every minute or</v>

130
00:06:38.811 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 1>every second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've now got these,</v>

131
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these parallel streams of data I have to</v>

132
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's unclear exactly how much</v>

133
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 1>data I would want to keep for how long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's certainly a new kind of data</v>

134
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:56.270
<v Speaker 1>architecture and for some companies will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a big data problem because there's</v>

135
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 1>going to be a lot of this data for large</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

136
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of sensors and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>facilities or a lot of products that</v>

137
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:05.390
<v Speaker 1>they want to track or whatever it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they want to get more insight into</v>

138
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:10.391
<v Speaker 1>by putting tags or sensors on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to me this is one of the sort of</v>

139
00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:17.111
<v Speaker 1>subset subdomains of big data around</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensor data streams of data that we're</v>

140
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:20.330
<v Speaker 1>going to have to think about new</v>
<v Speaker 1>architectures and new designs for a new</v>

141
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:22.520
<v Speaker 1>technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for capturing them,</v>

142
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 1>storing them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>processing them,</v>

143
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Speaker 1>aggregating them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyzing them.</v>

144
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.680
<v Speaker 1>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's going to be a real</v>

145
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:32.681
<v Speaker 1>interesting evolution to see how the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>data technologies and and technologies</v>

146
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:37.880
<v Speaker 1>in general are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are emerging to deal with streams of,</v>

147
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:38.690
<v Speaker 1>of sensor data.</v>
