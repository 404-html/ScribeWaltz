00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:00.843
<v Speaker 1>MMM,</v>

2
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all,</v>

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.440
<v Speaker 2>all of us have a creative process and</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of it is the structure that the</v>

4
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 2>advertising business itself gives us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do what we call a strategic document</v>

6
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 2>and that document gives us all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bricks that we need to build a house.</v>

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like the architecture plan to build</v>
<v Speaker 2>a house,</v>

8
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.580
<v Speaker 2>but then eventually it all comes down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and your partner.</v>

9
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 2>We always work in teams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our art director,</v>

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 2>person in a writing person together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although those lines are blurred now and</v>

11
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:41.460
<v Speaker 2>then we sit down at 11:00 at night in</v>
<v Speaker 2>our offices trying to think of something</v>

12
00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 2>really brilliant that nobody else has</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought of before and that process</v>

13
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:50.511
<v Speaker 2>usually involves drinking a lot of water</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going to the bathroom because when</v>

14
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 2>you go to the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either in the bathroom or in the shower,</v>

15
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 2>it's the one time you actually let your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain relax enough to think of something</v>

16
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>

17
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:05.280
<v Speaker 2>if you're too stressed out and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>working so hard to think of something,</v>

18
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 2>your brain just kinda closes up on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have a lot of water in the agency</v>

19
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 2>and every single time somebody comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>back from the bathroom,</v>

20
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.520
<v Speaker 2>they always say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>

21
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 2>always say when they come in the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an idea.</v>

22
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 2>It might not be the best idea or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>

23
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 2>but it's an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it usually we feed on each other's</v>

24
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 2>ideas and that's how we build a and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to where nobody else has been.</v>
