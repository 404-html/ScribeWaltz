1
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>What I'm talking about is something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will take a generation to do what I need</v>

2
00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:20.200
<v Speaker 1>to start there is that if we're looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a healthcare fix for something as</v>

3
00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:21.940
<v Speaker 1>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.043
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

5
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.570
<v Speaker 1>with the previous choices we've made in</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>

6
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.820
<v Speaker 1>that's going to have a fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact on our system.</v>

7
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.560
<v Speaker 1>It's hopeless to too many of us depend</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the current forms of financing.</v>

8
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.610
<v Speaker 1>I have spent our whole lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>participating in it for an instantaneous</v>

9
00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:38.620
<v Speaker 1>change and frankly the whole healthcare</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

10
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.390
<v Speaker 1>which is almost a fifth of our economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been set up with an existing system.</v>

11
00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:46.240
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing you need is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation commitment.</v>

12
00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's taken roughly 50 years to create</v>

13
00:00:48.971 --> 00:00:51.340
<v Speaker 1>this mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to solve it in 12.</v>

14
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 1>You're really gonna have to be committed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fundamental change over time.</v>

15
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.150
<v Speaker 1>That's a very hard thing for our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or frankly any political system to do</v>

16
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>other than accidentally we did it</v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally with Medicare and Medicaid</v>

17
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:05.440
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and company funded insurance to do it</v>

18
00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>intentionally as much harder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

19
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:08.170
<v Speaker 1>that's number one.</v>

20
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>It's just a realistic sense of what it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to take.</v>

21
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are really three important</v>

22
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:15.910
<v Speaker 1>elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number One,</v>

23
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.380
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.190
<v Speaker 1>and I think many Americans do that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>really does need to be a true cradle to</v>

25
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:25.060
<v Speaker 1>grave safety net for all Americans for</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic health,</v>

26
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.470
<v Speaker 1>which is really the initial starting</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of many of these debates in some</v>

27
00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:31.540
<v Speaker 1>cases over a hundred years ago in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed world.</v>

28
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.520
<v Speaker 1>We still don't have that and I think I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think at two,</v>

29
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.390
<v Speaker 1>one will be up to near two and a half</v>
<v Speaker 1>trillion dollars of spending next year.</v>

30
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.770
<v Speaker 1>The number one question we need to ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves is how on earth do we spend</v>

31
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:48.100
<v Speaker 1>two and a half trillion dollars on</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare a year and not have a true</v>

32
00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:50.290
<v Speaker 1>safety net for health catastrophes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For All Americans?</v>

33
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 1>That's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me what that's about is</v>

34
00:01:53.741 --> 00:01:54.970
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic insurance.</v>

35
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>It actually is an insurable good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike so much of what is uninsured and</v>

36
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.180
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I start there and it needs to be a</v>

37
00:02:01.181 --> 00:02:04.120
<v Speaker 1>national pool because we can't get into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation.</v>

38
00:02:04.121 --> 00:02:08.830
<v Speaker 1>We see now when we have private</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance insurers competing for profit</v>

39
00:02:08.831 --> 00:02:13.000
<v Speaker 1>growth in part on how successful they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are on underwriting out the worst cases.</v>

40
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 1>We can't just let the public pay for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>worst cases.</v>

41
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.690
<v Speaker 1>It's actually an extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflationary approach to creating an</v>

42
00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:21.040
<v Speaker 1>insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we need a national poll.</v>

43
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Beyond that though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to look at funding non</v>

44
00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:28.480
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which does include late life care</v>

45
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.640
<v Speaker 1>because it's plannable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

46
00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Unlike most insurance events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

47
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.200
<v Speaker 1>it's something that we can plan during</v>
<v Speaker 1>our life and that we do fund during our</v>

48
00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:36.160
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:40.090
<v Speaker 1>but also a lot of disease management</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues and frankly a lot of routine care</v>

50
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.340
<v Speaker 1>in the ways we fund other things in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>

51
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.470
<v Speaker 1>How do we do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do that out of income,</v>

52
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.440
<v Speaker 1>out of savings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of credit against future savings.</v>

53
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.760
<v Speaker 1>And so what I would like to see over</v>
<v Speaker 1>time is a shift in the enormous</v>

54
00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:55.720
<v Speaker 1>resources that we currently pay to</v>
<v Speaker 1>support the insurance system back to</v>

55
00:02:55.721 --> 00:02:58.750
<v Speaker 1>consumers to allow them both to fund</v>
<v Speaker 1>their current,</v>

56
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical expenses and save for future.</v>

57
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Once it has a couple of benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Benefit number one is it returns us to</v>

58
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>our role as consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

59
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.240
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

60
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does something.</v>

61
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>We have to start with one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think now,</v>

62
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indisputable fact,</v>

63
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.390
<v Speaker 1>which is our 50 year reliance on</v>
<v Speaker 1>employers and insurers on governments to</v>

64
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:27.410
<v Speaker 1>control costs have failed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.980
<v Speaker 1>W W we will hear endless details of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can do it better in this odd,</v>

66
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>this new regulation will finally do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you follow the last 50 years of</v>

67
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've tried a lot of different things</v>

68
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>that Medicare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicaid,</v>

69
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>and private insurance and that theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that big will exercise,</v>

70
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>leverage and leverage will keep prices</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

71
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if 50 years of the past experience</v>

72
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 1>hasn't taught us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't work,</v>

73
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 1>then I guess we'll need more years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

74
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I at least not many others believe at</v>
<v Speaker 1>some point you say,</v>

75
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't work.</v>

76
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>What will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

77
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 1>the one thing we really haven't tried is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do what works everywhere else,</v>

78
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 1>which is to have a mass of desegregated</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking consumers,</v>

79
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing prices,</v>

80
00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>forcing quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forcing accountability.</v>

81
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.990
<v Speaker 1>That's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

82
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:13.750
<v Speaker 1>I do want to come back to criticisms</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that approach because I think</v>

83
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 1>there's some important criticisms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that approach,</v>

84
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 1>but that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.340
<v Speaker 1>where I start the second is we have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid the use it or lose it.</v>

86
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:28.441
<v Speaker 1>Approach to financing healthcare and</v>
<v Speaker 1>reliance on insurance and on government</v>

87
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>programs means that every dollar we put</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the system is going to be spent on</v>

88
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about an individual's own</v>

89
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:37.120
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

90
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.210
<v Speaker 1>you save money for rainy days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

91
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>but if it doesn't rain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may not apply an umbrella.</v>

92
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 1>The healthcare system doesn't quite work</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>

93
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once a lot of the money we take from</v>

94
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 1>people to pay for insurance premiums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicare tax,</v>

95
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 1>a medicare premiums down the road is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>case you need it.</v>

96
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.390
<v Speaker 1>But the very fact it's there means it</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be spent on healthcare.</v>

97
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Now from an individual's perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may seem irrelevant,</v>

98
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 1>but from a society's perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real problem because at coming up</v>

99
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 1>very soon or 20 percent of GDP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dollars we're spending on healthcare</v>

100
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.150
<v Speaker 1>are things we can't spend on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other good things in life,</v>

101
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>and you may be aware of my article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk about how we don't even know if</v>

102
00:05:20.171 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>we're making the the expenditures that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are best for our health.</v>

103
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 1>We just know we're making the</v>
<v Speaker 1>expenditures that provide the most</v>

104
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>health care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are different things.</v>

105
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can answer the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would we as a society be better off all</v>

106
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>giving each ourselves another week</v>
<v Speaker 1>vacation?</v>

107
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 1>We're spending another 150 billion on</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare.</v>

108
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 1>They're almost treated differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not different.</v>

109
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:44.251
<v Speaker 1>Of course we're at a point in our health</v>
<v Speaker 1>where over 50 percent of annual deaths</v>

110
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.960
<v Speaker 1>come from conditions or causes that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>more to do with lifestyle.</v>

111
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is of course heart disease,</v>

112
00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 1>diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accident,</v>

113
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 1>suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homicide.</v>

114
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Then they have to do with health care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've done a great job in healthcare to</v>

115
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 1>get to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But being at that point,</v>

116
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 1>if we're interested in improving our</v>
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>

117
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>we don't know that these investments are</v>
<v Speaker 1>better made in healthcare or all the</v>

118
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 1>other aspects of health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's recreation or environment</v>

119
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:16.580
<v Speaker 1>or nutrition or what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are being crowded out by society's</v>

120
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:19.120
<v Speaker 1>decision to fund healthcare in a use it</v>
<v Speaker 1>or lose it way.</v>

121
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 1>So this is less important for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>

122
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 1>perhaps more important for us as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

123
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.020
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm seeking to do is I'm seeking</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say rather than look for a magic</v>

124
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>single way to finance health care,</v>

125
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 1>which I think comes out of that early</v>
<v Speaker 1>misconception I talked about that</v>

126
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 1>healthcare is sort of a lump emergency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Need it,</v>

127
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.890
<v Speaker 1>we know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay for it.</v>

128
00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Speaker 1>That's not true anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much more complex than that.</v>

129
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.190
<v Speaker 1>We need to match the way we finance</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare to how we use it to what it</v>

130
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are emergencies that are</v>

131
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

132
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.790
<v Speaker 1>not all of us will have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's completely appropriate for</v>

133
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:54.920
<v Speaker 1>insurance to finance them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insurance is actually the most efficient</v>

134
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>way to finance them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insurance that the least efficient,</v>

135
00:06:57.741 --> 00:06:59.660
<v Speaker 1>most costly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most distorted way of financing</v>

136
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.553
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

137
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.710
<v Speaker 1>The first one is just a financial one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is people saying,</v>

138
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 1>I can't afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have enough trouble affording my</v>

139
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:10.940
<v Speaker 1>deductible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they are right.</v>

140
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 1>The key to this is that generational</v>
<v Speaker 1>shift I talk about every year.</v>

141
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.330
<v Speaker 1>We need to reduce a bit our reliance on</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance and take some of the resources</v>

142
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 1>we use to pay those premiums and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to consumers.</v>

143
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.010
<v Speaker 1>We need to gradually over a 20 year</v>
<v Speaker 1>period increased the deductible</v>

144
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:31.310
<v Speaker 1>insurance policies from what they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>now to general catastrophic.</v>

145
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:36.230
<v Speaker 1>What that will do is it will move more</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare resources to individuals,</v>

146
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enabling them to finance their care.</v>

147
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only good news about spending two</v>

148
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:44.420
<v Speaker 1>and a half trillion dollars on</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare is that all of us,</v>

149
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.350
<v Speaker 1>and I mean all of us are spending an</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible amount of money on care.</v>

150
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.700
<v Speaker 1>We may not be aware of it.</v>

151
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.030
<v Speaker 1>We may think somebody else is paying for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

152
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.300
<v Speaker 1>That's an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

153
00:07:55.301 --> 00:07:59.090
<v Speaker 1>one of things I looked at it in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>article was hire higher 23 year old</v>

154
00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 1>today and he spends his entire career</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my company and he has a spouse and</v>

155
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:08.741
<v Speaker 1>a couple of kids and a few years and</v>
<v Speaker 1>retires at 65 and lives to lady,</v>

156
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what would the amount of money that</v>

157
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:17.780
<v Speaker 1>goes into the system for that 23 year</v>
<v Speaker 1>old and started them at entry level</v>

158
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:20.040
<v Speaker 1>salary $30,000 a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

159
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.960
<v Speaker 1>which is roughly 60 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>average household income in our country.</v>

160
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 1>And had him grow that his income grow at</v>
<v Speaker 1>three percent over the course of his</v>

161
00:08:28.161 --> 00:08:29.270
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a salary,</v>

162
00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:34.271
<v Speaker 1>have little over $100,000 by retires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I made an assumption which hasn't</v>

163
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 1>been true for 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is let's say the growth of all</v>

164
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.070
<v Speaker 1>healthcare is only equal to the growth</v>
<v Speaker 1>of income,</v>

165
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:41.870
<v Speaker 1>of course has been running one or two</v>
<v Speaker 1>points above income.</v>

166
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 1>The amazing thing is that 23 year old is</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at one point $7,</v>

167
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:51.791
<v Speaker 1>million dollars being spent on his or</v>
<v Speaker 1>her behalf to fund his household,</v>

168
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>had medical care over their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's everything that's,</v>

169
00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own share of,</v>

170
00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:58.960
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

171
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 1>health insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their out of pocket.</v>

172
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

173
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.990
<v Speaker 1>their medicare premiums when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>seniors,</v>

174
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:07.530
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that they actually see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the stuff they don't see</v>

175
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 1>what their employer paid on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>behalf.</v>

176
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>The Medicare tax that came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

177
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

178
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting is I realized later</v>

179
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:23.160
<v Speaker 1>that I understated it because I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>include the amount of general tax</v>

180
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:25.080
<v Speaker 1>revenues that subsidizing our</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>

181
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.730
<v Speaker 1>which is another big bite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's,</v>

182
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 1>let's forget that for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you said to the average 23</v>

183
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:32.610
<v Speaker 1>year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to participate in this</v>

184
00:09:32.611 --> 00:09:35.370
<v Speaker 1>insurance system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you want a million dollars over your</v>

185
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:38.070
<v Speaker 1>life to spend on your own care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't spend it on your own</v>

186
00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:38.904
<v Speaker 1>care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

187
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 1>you can put it away.</v>

188
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.520
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ask you to do is I'm going to insist</v>

189
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:45.040
<v Speaker 1>you buy catastrophic insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any question what</v>

190
00:09:45.041 --> 00:09:48.600
<v Speaker 1>the average 23 year old and say now you</v>
<v Speaker 1>say an average 23 year old may not be</v>

191
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:50.330
<v Speaker 1>smart enough to make that decision or</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm,</v>

192
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 1>but let's look at the impact on</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody in this country have a</v>

193
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:59.331
<v Speaker 1>healthcare system that costs the average</v>
<v Speaker 1>employer who pays insurance 12 grand a</v>

194
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:04.260
<v Speaker 1>year per employee 12 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're earning the average income</v>

195
00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:06.030
<v Speaker 1>in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$50,000,</v>

196
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:11.300
<v Speaker 1>your employer is paying $62,000 was</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget about social security tax and</v>

197
00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Medicare tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a moment for the privilege of employing</v>

198
00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:17.940
<v Speaker 1>you and you're getting only 50 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is an extraordinary aggressive tax.</v>

199
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.800
<v Speaker 1>The interesting thing is if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>transferred that 12 grand to the average</v>

200
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.400
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could buy catastrophic care for the</v>

201
00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:28.830
<v Speaker 1>whole family and have a significant</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of money,</v>

202
00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.290
<v Speaker 1>leftover savings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the health savings account or per year.</v>

203
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.610
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be willing to do both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be willing to reduce the</v>

204
00:10:35.611 --> 00:10:38.400
<v Speaker 1>coverage of insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but transfer those resources to</v>

205
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 1>individuals and if you're not willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do both and people would be afraid that</v>

206
00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:43.241
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

207
00:10:43.241 --> 00:10:45.360
<v Speaker 1>the you can't have a consumer driven</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

208
00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.020
<v Speaker 1>The second concern I think a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have is consumers aren't wise</v>

209
00:10:49.021 --> 00:10:54.021
<v Speaker 1>enough or smart enough or capable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving pricing and quality in our</v>

210
00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:59.331
<v Speaker 1>healthcare system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think as a lot of fundamental</v>

211
00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:03.660
<v Speaker 1>reforms have to deal with that seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be comparing a proposed new approach was</v>

212
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:06.870
<v Speaker 1>something that doesn't exist today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consumers make all the decisions on</v>

213
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:09.000
<v Speaker 1>their healthcare today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not the negative ones,</v>

214
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.940
<v Speaker 1>but you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't treat somebody without their</v>

215
00:11:11.941 --> 00:11:14.190
<v Speaker 1>choosing the treatment without they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeing to the treatment.</v>

216
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm not proposing getting rid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctors.</v>

217
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying let's take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals who advise you now out of</v>

218
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:23.160
<v Speaker 1>the system and you design your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment and find someone to do it.</v>

219
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:28.580
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is right now we have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>system where doctors advise a patients</v>

220
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.540
<v Speaker 1>make the ultimate decisions subject to</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance company via.</v>

221
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I am removing the insurance company from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that equation,</v>

222
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.050
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that most consumers</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>

223
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that puts me in a terrible position.</v>

224
00:11:41.881 --> 00:11:45.870
<v Speaker 1>I rely on my insurance company to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>me through my life self care decisions</v>

225
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.150
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another thing that I think again</v>

226
00:11:48.151 --> 00:11:50.130
<v Speaker 1>comes out of the island nature of health</v>
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>

227
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Very few of us are true active</v>
<v Speaker 1>comparative shoppers and everything we</v>

228
00:11:55.421 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 1>buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all benefit from the existence of</v>

229
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Walmart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we shop there or have ever in</v>

230
00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:02.560
<v Speaker 1>our lives compare the price of</v>
<v Speaker 1>toothpaste.</v>

231
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.820
<v Speaker 1>What happens in a consumer driven</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy isn't that every consumer after</v>

232
00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:10.200
<v Speaker 1>getting hit by the bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes to the Internet and calls up a</v>

233
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.670
<v Speaker 1>emergency surgeons to see who to hire</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at what price.</v>

234
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:17.290
<v Speaker 1>What happens is is you benefit from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that the entire structure of</v>

235
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:21.430
<v Speaker 1>providers is altered to attract</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumers as opposed to serve insurers</v>

236
00:12:21.431 --> 00:12:22.670
<v Speaker 1>and governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>

237
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:27.070
<v Speaker 1>That's the dynamic I'm trying to capture</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a consumer centric approach.</v>

238
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.280
<v Speaker 1>That dynamic of providers who answer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>us patient consumers and not to</v>

239
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:35.800
<v Speaker 1>intermediaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you spend time in a hospital</v>

240
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.800
<v Speaker 1>watching a patient be treated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for a second,</v>

241
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:41.980
<v Speaker 1>can you forget that that patient isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>the customer of that hospital.</v>

242
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Can't forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it in the care in almost every</v>

243
00:12:44.501 --> 00:12:48.700
<v Speaker 1>element of the care and if you've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the rest of our economy and bought</v>

244
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>anything in the rest of the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

245
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:50.920
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nowhere else.</v>

246
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's a crucial thing.</v>

247
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many.</v>

248
00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some of the objectives,</v>

249
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've talked about today are things</v>

250
00:13:06.311 --> 00:13:11.311
<v Speaker 1>that people are increasingly aware may</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter a in resolving this sort of trap</v>

251
00:13:11.441 --> 00:13:14.380
<v Speaker 1>we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ever reducing access ever lower</v>

252
00:13:14.381 --> 00:13:17.740
<v Speaker 1>quality and ever higher prices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of them is there's an</v>

253
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:22.741
<v Speaker 1>awareness that a lack of competition and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lack of price transparency makes it</v>

254
00:13:23.471 --> 00:13:27.350
<v Speaker 1>difficult for consumers to exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

255
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.880
<v Speaker 1>any of the disciplinary force they do in</v>
<v Speaker 1>most other industries.</v>

256
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.730
<v Speaker 1>There's been a movement in some states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly for greater price</v>

257
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:37.090
<v Speaker 1>transparency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately it's not true price</v>

258
00:13:37.091 --> 00:13:40.930
<v Speaker 1>transparency is list price and of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitals don't charge this price for</v>

259
00:13:40.931 --> 00:13:42.610
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

260
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.460
<v Speaker 1>so it's been fairly meaningless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a step.</v>

261
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.620
<v Speaker 1>It's an understanding of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the right direction.</v>

262
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.720
<v Speaker 1>One of the interesting things that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurring,</v>

263
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Speaker 1>and we've seen it occur and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>government programs as well,</v>

264
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.250
<v Speaker 1>is that there is the beginnings of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something of a shadow economy and</v>

265
00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.890
<v Speaker 1>healthcare for people who are outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system,</v>

266
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for many of those who either don't have</v>

267
00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:05.620
<v Speaker 1>access to health insurance or can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>afford health insurance.</v>

268
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is increasingly a cash and credit</v>

269
00:14:08.861 --> 00:14:11.110
<v Speaker 1>based economy around health care</v>
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>

270
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.250
<v Speaker 1>There are parts of this country you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive around and see services advertised</v>

271
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.540
<v Speaker 1>on billboards on a cash only basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

272
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.100
<v Speaker 1>you obviously see some of these clinics</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have opened in walmarts and cvs is,</v>

273
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.100
<v Speaker 1>they'd get at one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

274
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you would expect to</v>

275
00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:29.950
<v Speaker 1>see in a more consumer oriented system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has real value services,</v>

276
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some of the less complex,</v>

277
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:36.300
<v Speaker 1>a more easy to replicate a treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

278
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.760
<v Speaker 1>possibilities such as it is many in</v>
<v Speaker 1>primary care.</v>

279
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we have to be,</v>

280
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.870
<v Speaker 1>we have to be candid about the walls</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the political process.</v>

281
00:14:46.871 --> 00:14:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality is most Americans are happy</v>

282
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 1>with their health insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think some pulsate it's 55 or 60</v>

283
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:55.370
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

284
00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.620
<v Speaker 1>and probably a percentage of those who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have health insurance,</v>

285
00:14:57.621 --> 00:15:00.440
<v Speaker 1>it may even be higher and as long as</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the case,</v>

286
00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to expect any politician</v>
<v Speaker 1>to propose fundamental reform.</v>

287
00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:06.230
<v Speaker 1>They can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are enormous interest groups,</v>

288
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that existed in the,</v>

289
00:15:08.311 --> 00:15:10.910
<v Speaker 1>in the provision of healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

290
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.970
<v Speaker 1>who would be opposed to anything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative that affects the status quo</v>

291
00:15:13.971 --> 00:15:16.010
<v Speaker 1>negatively from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously anything we had real</v>

292
00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:19.160
<v Speaker 1>discipline on price would negatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect the status quo for these interest</v>

293
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:21.590
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No politician's going to buck that for a</v>

294
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:26.480
<v Speaker 1>public that believes it's got a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal at 55 or 60 percent approval.</v>

295
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.880
<v Speaker 1>You can't go at the fundamental of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

296
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.510
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned in my article and the</v>

297
00:15:35.511 --> 00:15:40.160
<v Speaker 1>reasons I spent a lot of time on numbers</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I think this is actually an</v>

298
00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:43.160
<v Speaker 1>illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think much of healthcare policy has</v>

299
00:15:43.161 --> 00:15:46.970
<v Speaker 1>been about perpetuating this illusion</v>
<v Speaker 1>that somebody else's magically paying</v>

300
00:15:46.971 --> 00:15:48.470
<v Speaker 1>for your care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

301
00:15:48.471 --> 00:15:52.580
<v Speaker 1>one of things I talk about is a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>common among my fellow liberals is to</v>

302
00:15:52.581 --> 00:15:53.301
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

303
00:15:53.301 --> 00:15:56.510
<v Speaker 1>if we eliminated advertising and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminated the profit motive in order</v>

304
00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.880
<v Speaker 1>things I mentioned in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my articles,</v>

305
00:15:57.881 --> 00:16:01.760
<v Speaker 1>if you confiscated the profits of every</v>
<v Speaker 1>single American company,</v>

306
00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:05.360
<v Speaker 1>forget about the drug companies and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the hospital companies and the</v>

307
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:07.850
<v Speaker 1>device manufacture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take every prophet,</v>

308
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.250
<v Speaker 1>every dollar of profit in the American</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>

309
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.660
<v Speaker 1>You'd pay for something like four or</v>
<v Speaker 1>five months of our healthcare in two and</v>

310
00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:16.100
<v Speaker 1>a half trillion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not there yet.</v>

311
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.900
<v Speaker 1>We'll be there next year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the number of this year is</v>

312
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.790
<v Speaker 1>likely to be somewhere between two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three to four,</v>

313
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:25.180
<v Speaker 1>but two and a half trillion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only people who can pay for</v>

314
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.640
<v Speaker 1>healthcare is all of us and we're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying for an enormous amounts,</v>

315
00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:31.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hear people talk all the time.</v>

316
00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:34.260
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons I,</v>

317
00:16:34.261 --> 00:16:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

318
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have so few friends left,</v>

319
00:16:36.561 --> 00:16:38.810
<v Speaker 1>is one of the things I do at dinner</v>
<v Speaker 1>parties is talk about,</v>

320
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.780
<v Speaker 1>I asked people to mention a healthcare</v>
<v Speaker 1>bill I have and I break it down,</v>

321
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.500
<v Speaker 1>what do you think the costs of that are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you'll see a $5,000 bill for</v>

322
00:16:45.501 --> 00:16:48.500
<v Speaker 1>something that probably had five or $600</v>
<v Speaker 1>and marginal cost,</v>

323
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll recognize just how</v>

324
00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:54.680
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary the inflation is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll also recognize that what your</v>

325
00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:58.130
<v Speaker 1>friend was worried about was the three</v>
<v Speaker 1>or $400 they had to pay against it.</v>

326
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.230
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

327
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference in that is costing us all</v>

328
00:17:02.451 --> 00:17:04.520
<v Speaker 1>a fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moment at which everybody says,</v>

329
00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:08.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like having a credit card.</v>

330
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I can go out and buy a $2,000 plasma</v>
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>

331
00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.090
<v Speaker 1>not pay for it at that moment and tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

332
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.190
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this plasma tv costs me nothing.</v>

333
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.950
<v Speaker 1>It's the damn credit card bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's costing me a fortune.</v>

334
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what we've done in healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

335
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:26.690
<v Speaker 1>and unfortunately we have divided the</v>
<v Speaker 1>funding among so many different places,</v>

336
00:17:26.691 --> 00:17:28.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ourselves.</v>

337
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

338
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our employer in many cases,</v>

339
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:37.540
<v Speaker 1>various targeted taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government general revenues that</v>

340
00:17:38.301 --> 00:17:39.770
<v Speaker 1>people don't sit there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

341
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.730
<v Speaker 1>the average middle class family is</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably looking at 20,</v>

342
00:17:43.731 --> 00:17:47.630
<v Speaker 1>30 percent of their income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody somewhere taking out and paying</v>

343
00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 1>for healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's extraordinarily regressive.</v>

344
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.320
<v Speaker 1>And I think if there's awareness of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when there's awareness of that and it</v>

345
00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:58.350
<v Speaker 1>may take more time and more spending and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more afraid,</v>

346
00:17:58.351 --> 00:18:01.160
<v Speaker 1>safety net and frankly more people</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering and being hurt,</v>

347
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:04.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us to get the realization that there</v>

348
00:18:04.021 --> 00:18:08.130
<v Speaker 1>is no free ride in healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's costing us a fortune and we're all</v>

349
00:18:08.131 --> 00:18:10.110
<v Speaker 1>being hurt by the lack of discipline in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system.</v>

350
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I think only then you'll look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>true fundamental reform being</v>

351
00:18:13.891 --> 00:18:17.790
<v Speaker 1>politically possible for politicians to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the enormous political risk of</v>

352
00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:19.470
<v Speaker 1>saying to some of the interest groups in</v>
<v Speaker 1>health care.</v>

353
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the pie hasn't been.</v>

354
00:18:21.451 --> 00:18:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>
