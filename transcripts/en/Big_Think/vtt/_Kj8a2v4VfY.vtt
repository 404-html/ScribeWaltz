00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.950
<v Speaker 1>There is a lot of water on Mars and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there once was a lot of surface flowing</v>

2
00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:11.690
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't see it because it's,</v>

4
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.860
<v Speaker 1>most of it is mixed with the soil which</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call regolith on Mars.</v>

5
00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:23.861
<v Speaker 1>So the Martian soil can be anywhere from</v>
<v Speaker 1>as little as one percent in some very</v>

6
00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:27.560
<v Speaker 1>dry desert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like areas to as much as 60 percent</v>

7
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One strategy for getting water when</v>

8
00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:34.160
<v Speaker 1>you're on Mars is to break up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>regolith,</v>

9
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:37.520
<v Speaker 1>which would take something like a Jack</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hammer because it's very cold.</v>

10
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.550
<v Speaker 1>It's very frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can imagine making a frozen brick</v>

11
00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:47.870
<v Speaker 1>or a chunk of ice that's mostly soil and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe half water and half soil,</v>

12
00:00:47.871 --> 00:00:51.290
<v Speaker 1>that's what you would be dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to break this up,</v>

13
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:54.410
<v Speaker 1>put it in an oven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it heats up,</v>

14
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.470
<v Speaker 1>it turns to steam your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run it through a distillation to,</v>

15
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>and you have pure drinking.</v>

16
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Water comes out the other end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a much easier way to get water</v>

17
00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 1>on Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.600
<v Speaker 1>in this country we have developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial dehumidifiers.</v>

19
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a very simple machines that</v>

20
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:18.101
<v Speaker 1>simply blow the air in a room or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>building across a mineral called zoo</v>

21
00:01:18.131 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>lights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zeolite is very common on earth that's</v>

22
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:24.020
<v Speaker 1>very common on Mars and Zeolite is Kinda</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a sponge.</v>

23
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:27.500
<v Speaker 1>It absorbs water like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes the humidity right out of the</v>

24
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:31.400
<v Speaker 1>air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you squeeze it and outcomes the</v>

25
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:35.960
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And scientists working for NASA at the</v>

26
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.440
<v Speaker 1>University of Washington as long ago as</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 in the 19,</v>

27
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.070
<v Speaker 1>late 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed a machine called a waiver that</v>

28
00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:46.190
<v Speaker 1>very efficiently sucks water out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martian atmosphere.</v>

29
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.960
<v Speaker 1>So water is not nearly significant</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem that appears to be.</v>

30
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:55.220
<v Speaker 1>We also know from orbiters around Mars</v>
<v Speaker 1>and right now there are five satellites</v>

31
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:58.340
<v Speaker 1>orbiting Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know from photographs that these</v>

32
00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:02.990
<v Speaker 1>orbiters have taken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a geological studies that</v>

33
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:06.830
<v Speaker 1>they've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is frozen ice on the surface of</v>

34
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:07.251
<v Speaker 1>Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

35
00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:12.240
<v Speaker 1>There's tons of it at the polls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it is overladen with frozen or</v>

36
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.440
<v Speaker 1>mixed with frozen carbon dioxide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in many craters on Mars,</v>

37
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.530
<v Speaker 1>there apparently are sheets of frozen</v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

38
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.950
<v Speaker 1>So if early astronauts are early</v>
<v Speaker 1>voyagers tomorrow's where to land near</v>

39
00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>one of those sheets of ice in a crater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.230
<v Speaker 1>they would have all the water they need.</v>
