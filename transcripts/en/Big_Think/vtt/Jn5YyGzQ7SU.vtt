1
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Our drug policy has really been</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditionally based on racism and</v>

2
00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:13.810
<v Speaker 1>moralizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason that they currently illegal</v>

3
00:00:13.811 --> 00:00:17.230
<v Speaker 1>drugs are illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has nothing to do with the scientific</v>

4
00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:20.200
<v Speaker 1>evaluation of the relative risks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits.</v>

5
00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could never come up with a situation</v>

6
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.260
<v Speaker 1>where marijuana is illegal and tobacco</v>
<v Speaker 1>is legal.</v>

7
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.540
<v Speaker 1>You cannot make a rational argument for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

8
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.450
<v Speaker 1>That comes from racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and colonialism,</v>

10
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>the drug laws were made in explicitly</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist circumstances for explicitly</v>

11
00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:41.860
<v Speaker 1>racist reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

12
00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:46.000
<v Speaker 1>the first anti cocaine laws were made</v>
<v Speaker 1>because cocaine supposedly made black</v>

13
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:50.320
<v Speaker 1>men impervious to bullets and prone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting involved with white women.</v>

14
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.340
<v Speaker 1>This is complete nonsense where there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>no science to it whatsoever.</v>

15
00:00:54.341 --> 00:00:57.400
<v Speaker 1>And yet it was published in the New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>Times in the early 19 hundreds.</v>

16
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>So this is where our laws come from and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to be honest about that and we</v>

17
00:01:03.221 --> 00:01:07.510
<v Speaker 1>have to stop pretending that there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of rational basis for the laws</v>

18
00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 1>that we currently have.</v>

19
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Then what we need to do is realize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't make policy based on,</v>

20
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it's bad for you to have honor</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pleasure.</v>

21
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.750
<v Speaker 1>You have to make policy based on does</v>
<v Speaker 1>this hurt you,</v>

22
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>does this hurt other people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

23
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.650
<v Speaker 1>that's where harm reduction comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The basic idea of harm reduction is what</v>

24
00:01:26.651 --> 00:01:30.250
<v Speaker 1>policy will most reduce the harm related</v>
<v Speaker 1>to drugs.</v>

25
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.500
<v Speaker 1>And once you start to focus on harm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to look not only at harm</v>

26
00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:39.610
<v Speaker 1>associated with drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but harm associated with drug policy.</v>

27
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>And this is why so many harm reduction</v>
<v Speaker 1>people rapidly become legalizers because</v>

28
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>the harm associated with drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>prohibition has not produced the results</v>

29
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.120
<v Speaker 1>that people would like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does not stop addiction.</v>

30
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.070
<v Speaker 1>It does not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent kids from using drugs.</v>

32
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.750
<v Speaker 1>It makes the kids who use drugs be at</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher risk of dying from them on.</v>

33
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.040
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Saves Society's productivity by like</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping people from taking substances</v>

35
00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:15.490
<v Speaker 1>that will make them not work on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't work.</v>

36
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>And when you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if addiction is defined as compulsive</v>

37
00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:25.840
<v Speaker 1>behavior despite negative consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're trying to use negative</v>

38
00:02:25.841 --> 00:02:30.580
<v Speaker 1>consequences in order to stop it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something is seriously wrong there.</v>

39
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>So our drug policy has to acknowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality that punishment doesn't fix</v>

40
00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:39.310
<v Speaker 1>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that putting drug users in cages</v>

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.450
<v Speaker 1>does nothing but worse than the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't deter kids.</v>

42
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least idea that like,</v>

43
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.530
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we just really stigmatize this and</v>

44
00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:50.620
<v Speaker 1>make everybody hate drug users,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then kids will never use drugs.</v>

45
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Kids are going to do stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>risky things.</v>

46
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.610
<v Speaker 1>You want to reduce the chances that</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things will kill them.</v>

47
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>The idea that can prevent adolescents</v>
<v Speaker 1>from having sex or prevent adolescents</v>

48
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>from doing some kind of risky behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just absurd.</v>

49
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.593
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>comes out before humans even evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

51
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:16.711
<v Speaker 1>this is where it comes back to racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our image of the typical drug user or</v>

52
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:21.811
<v Speaker 1>the typical drug addict is basically the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same as our racist stereotype of</v>

53
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>whichever groups we happen to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>targeting.</v>

54
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>So criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lying,</v>

55
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 1>manipulative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deceitful,</v>

56
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Ahm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.890
<v Speaker 1>all of these things that we project onto</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people and then stigmatize and</v>

58
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>attack them for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

59
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>we do the same with drug users.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously if you make a behavior that</v>

60
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>someone feels is essential to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>survival,</v>

61
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are going to lie to protect that</v>

62
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:49.560
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that they're</v>

63
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.570
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally a dishonest person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason that we continue to have</v>

64
00:03:55.361 --> 00:04:00.361
<v Speaker 1>these stereotypes about who drug users</v>
<v Speaker 1>are is because of the ongoing racism of</v>

65
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:06.571
<v Speaker 1>our society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And until we acknowledge that like I am</v>

66
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 1>the typical drug user,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there is such a thing,</v>

67
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't look like your stereotype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that the</v>

69
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 1>stereotype is accurate.</v>

70
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think that's a really important</v>

71
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>thing that people really have to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>because for too long the media has</v>

72
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:29.071
<v Speaker 1>enabled the racist view of addiction and</v>
<v Speaker 1>has enabled people to,</v>

73
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of say,</v>

74
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the typical addict.</v>

75
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.151
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:37.120
<v Speaker 1>and I used to say that and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>

77
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like kind of racist,</v>

78
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

79
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 1>it comes from images that we shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have ever had.</v>

80
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>So I think that the way to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 1>get beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way to help people with</v>

82
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>addiction is to understand that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>with addiction are not seeking extra</v>

83
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 1>pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are not hedonist who are just out</v>

84
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 1>there having so much fun using that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't stop them unless you put them</v>

85
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:07.540
<v Speaker 1>in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who get addicted,</v>

86
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:11.740
<v Speaker 1>which are only 10 to 20% of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who use drugs like cocaine and heroin</v>

87
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:12.970
<v Speaker 1>and prescription opioids.</v>

88
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Those people have problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The drug seemed like a solution to them</v>

89
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.160
<v Speaker 1>until we recognize that those people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking reasonably rationally to deal</v>

90
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:25.750
<v Speaker 1>with emotional and psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

91
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes economic problems.</v>

92
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 1>We are not going to solve this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I think we're</v>

93
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:36.991
<v Speaker 1>actually in denial about with regard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opioid epidemic is that while big</v>

94
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Pharma certainly didn't do anything good</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

95
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.840
<v Speaker 1>what they to say that this is caused by</v>
<v Speaker 1>purdue Pharma selling off the cotton is</v>

96
00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:51.871
<v Speaker 1>to miss the fact that the people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmingly becoming addicted are</v>

97
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:56.470
<v Speaker 1>people who are either falling out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle class or,</v>

98
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never managed to get into it.</v>

99
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 1>If you actually look at the economics of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this problem,</v>

100
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 1>it's not that middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People certainly don't get addicted and</v>

101
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>it's not that rich people don't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted.</v>

102
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just that if your life is despair</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you feel like it will never get any</v>

103
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is often the case when you lose</v>

104
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 1>the American dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you lose the hope for your future,</v>

105
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 1>opioids are going to become very</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>

106
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that we can solve this by</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking away the supply is just</v>

107
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:27.500
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

108
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 1>as soon as we started cracking down on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pill mills,</v>

109
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 1>we started seeing a rise in heroin use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not an unpredictable outcome</v>

110
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 1>since we supposedly believe that</v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction is a disease.</v>

111
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Why would we think that simply cutting</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the supply from some patients like</v>

112
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 1>turning over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like making a thousand people,</v>

113
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.530
<v Speaker 1>we take this doctor out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a thousand people and</v>

114
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>withdrawal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't provide any help for them</v>

115
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.920
<v Speaker 1>on why are we thinking this is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix this problem and why are we thinking</v>

116
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 1>that an illicit market is not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately grow up to satisfy that</v>

117
