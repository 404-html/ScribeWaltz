1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 2>well they did a show called the eyes of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nye</v>

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.510
<v Speaker 2>companies like Monsanto had patents on</v>
<v Speaker 2>genes and people were questioning</v>

4
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 2>whether or not that was ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

5
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 2>there was this overarching idea that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have enough food,</v>

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 2>we just can't distribute it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason people are starving in</v>

7
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:31.851
<v Speaker 2>the world is there's enough food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In my concern was the ecosystem.</v>

8
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Speaker 2>The sisters say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can know each organism very well and</v>

9
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 2>by no I mean you can know it's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sequence of its genes and you can grow</v>

10
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 2>it in isolation and refuges and see how</v>
<v Speaker 2>it performs.</v>

11
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.960
<v Speaker 2>This term had crops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

12
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.670
<v Speaker 2>there would be no need to experiment</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the ecosystem even though you can</v>

13
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 2>know the individual crop plant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what it would do.</v>

14
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.970
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's around butterflies or bees or birds</v>

15
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 2>or other pollinators or some virus we</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't discovered yet.</v>

16
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 2>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of things.</v>

17
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Three things have happened to my way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

18
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.083
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

19
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.210
<v Speaker 2>the least significant may be that we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>now ask,</v>

20
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:23.421
<v Speaker 2>say genes 10 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is to say no.</v>

21
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 2>One hundred million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 to the eighth time's faster than we</v>

22
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:32.601
<v Speaker 2>could 15 or 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The DNA sequencing machines are so</v>

23
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:36.780
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can actually simulate what would</v>

24
00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:41.781
<v Speaker 2>happen if this virus comes in or that</v>
<v Speaker 2>gene is introduced from a vector or an</v>

25
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 2>insect vector or what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing that you can make</v>

26
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:52.191
<v Speaker 2>predictions about how plants will grow</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on their genes very accurately,</v>

27
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 2>much more so than you could a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>decades ago.</v>

28
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 2>The second thing is there are seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>point 3 billion people in the world</v>

29
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early in the 20,</v>

30
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first century.</v>

31
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.960
<v Speaker 2>By the middle of the 21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be 9 billion.</v>

32
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 2>There might even be 10 billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those people are going to have to be</v>

33
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:13.800
<v Speaker 2>fed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sure enough,</v>

34
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way to do that is almost certainly</v>

35
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 2>with genetically modified crops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are much more productive than they</v>

36
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 2>used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then from a historic standpoint,</v>

37
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.830
<v Speaker 2>humans have always hybridized crops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now a humans are hybridizing them</v>

38
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 2>from a genetic standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just by combining sexually,</v>

39
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crops of desirable traits.</v>

40
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.350
<v Speaker 2>And the third thing that was very</v>
<v Speaker 2>compelling to me as a scientist is we've</v>

41
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 2>discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe everybody knew this except me,</v>

42
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:51.960
<v Speaker 2>and I'm the first one that we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered that genes are introduced</v>

43
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:56.961
<v Speaker 2>between species naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the paper that really got to me was</v>

44
00:02:57.031 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 2>the one about sweet potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sweet potatoes became sweet potatoes</v>

45
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:06.631
<v Speaker 2>because something like a virus infected</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sweet potatoes and changed their</v>

46
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 2>genes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then humans cultivated those gene</v>

47
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 2>changed potatoes.</v>

48
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.840
<v Speaker 2>And so without this introduction of</v>
<v Speaker 2>inter species between species genetic</v>

49
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 2>transfer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this wouldn't have happened.</v>

50
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these three things,</v>

51
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.250
<v Speaker 2>the ecosystem concern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rate at which we can ask,</v>

52
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 2>say genes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number of people that are going to</v>

53
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 2>have to be fed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the second one.</v>

54
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 2>And the third one is it happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally anyway.</v>

55
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these three things have changed my point</v>

56
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 2>of view about genetically modified foods</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the regulations for them are</v>

57
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 2>actually quite robust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just go creating a crop plant</v>

58
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be deleterious to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>farming system along with this,</v>

59
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:58.380
<v Speaker 2>everybody first to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

60
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.900
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can patent genes seems</v>

61
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 2>troubling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a little bit,</v>

62
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot to it that's very</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable.</v>

63
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.400
<v Speaker 2>Companies like pioneer seed company</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of dupont and the be mixed</v>

64
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 2>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monsanto,</v>

65
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 2>they spend a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge fraction of their resources on</v>

66
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 2>developing these plants.</v>

67
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.000
<v Speaker 2>And recently the patented soybean</v>
<v Speaker 2>expire.</v>

68
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 2>The patent expired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So soybeans are out now.</v>

69
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

70
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 2>so if you want to grow those soybeans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you can.</v>

71
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers do make contracts to grow those</v>

72
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:46.051
<v Speaker 2>plants because they grow better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we can imagine a future where</v>

73
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:51.781
<v Speaker 2>plants are tuned to grow in very moist</v>
<v Speaker 2>soils at the bottom of the hill where</v>

74
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:55.780
<v Speaker 2>the water runs down very dry soils at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top of the hill where the water</v>

75
00:04:55.781 --> 00:05:00.781
<v Speaker 2>drains away quickly and in between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the plants that would be planted,</v>

76
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:05.290
<v Speaker 2>the crop plants that will be planted</v>
<v Speaker 2>would vary like meter to meter,</v>

77
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.170
<v Speaker 2>certainly old crow across the farm</v>
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>

78
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 2>They would vary from one end to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other and they would be planted</v>

79
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.820
<v Speaker 2>electronically using global positioning</v>
<v Speaker 2>from outer space.</v>

80
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:18.070
<v Speaker 2>And this will enable people to feed the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

81
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

82
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:23.690
<v Speaker 2>I used to be against genetically</v>
<v Speaker 2>modified foods just for,</v>

83
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 2>from the cautionary principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what you're doing in the</v>

84
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 2>ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So be careful now I am for genetically</v>

85
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:33.640
<v Speaker 2>modified foods because we have so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>more science behind it than we did even</v>

86
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:34.360
<v Speaker 2>20 years ago.</v>
