1
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>All systems of oppression are highly</v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptive and they can adapt to</v>

2
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>challenges and incorporate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can allow for exceptions.</v>

3
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>And I think the most effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptation of the system of racism to</v>

4
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>the challenges of the civil rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement was to reduce a racist to a</v>

5
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:25.620
<v Speaker 1>very simple formula.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A racist is an individual,</v>

6
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>always an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a system who consciously does not</v>

7
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>like people based on race must be</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious and who intentionally seeks to</v>

8
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>be mean to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Individual conscious intent.</v>

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>And if that is my definition of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>

10
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.390
<v Speaker 1>then your suggestion that anything I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>said or done is racist or has a racist</v>

11
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hear that.</v>

12
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>As you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a bad person.</v>

13
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.200
<v Speaker 1>You just put me over there in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

14
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>And most of my bias anyway is</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

15
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not intending,</v>

16
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not aware.</v>

17
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now I'm going to need to defend my</v>

18
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:08.130
<v Speaker 1>moral character and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I will,</v>

19
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>and we've all seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be virtually impossible</v>

20
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:17.091
<v Speaker 1>based on that definition for the average</v>
<v Speaker 1>white person to look deeply at their</v>

21
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>socialization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at the inevitability of</v>

22
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:24.990
<v Speaker 1>internalizing racist biases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing racist patterns,</v>

23
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.400
<v Speaker 1>and having investments in the system of</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism,</v>

24
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty comfortable for us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>serves us really well.</v>

25
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that definition of a racist that</v>
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>

26
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>or what I call the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad binary is the root of virtually all</v>

27
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>white defensiveness on this topic</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it makes it virtually impossible</v>

28
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:49.221
<v Speaker 1>to talk to the average white person</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the inevitable absorption of a</v>

29
00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:55.041
<v Speaker 1>racist worldview that we get by being</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally swimming in racist water.</v>

30
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 1>So let me connect that to myself as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>result of being raised as a white person</v>

31
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 1>in this society.</v>

32
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I have a racist world view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have deep racist biases,</v>

33
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 1>I have developed a racist patterns and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have investments in the system of racism</v>

34
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's served me really well.</v>

35
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:14.650
<v Speaker 1>It's comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's helped me overcome the,</v>

36
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>the barriers that I do face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also have an investment and not</v>

37
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:23.460
<v Speaker 1>seeing any of that for what it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggest to me about my identity.</v>

38
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>And what it would require of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

39
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.290
<v Speaker 1>I didn't choose any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel guilty about it is an</v>

40
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:35.700
<v Speaker 1>inevitable result of being raised in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this society in which racism is the</v>

41
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>bedrock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question of guilt comes in in,</v>

42
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we who are white tend to be</v>

43
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>fragile in that it doesn't take much to</v>
<v Speaker 1>upset us around race.</v>

44
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.860
<v Speaker 1>The impact of our response is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>fragile at all.</v>

45
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a kind of weaponized defensiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weaponized,</v>

46
00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:58.830
<v Speaker 1>hurt feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

47
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>And it functions really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really effectively to repel the</v>

48
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:05.540
<v Speaker 1>challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

49
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>as a white person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved through the world racially</v>

50
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually 24 seven.</v>

51
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.140
<v Speaker 1>It is exceptional for me to be outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my racial comfort zone and most of my</v>

52
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>life I've been warned not to go outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>my racial comfort zone.</v>

53
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.920
<v Speaker 1>And so on the rare occasion when I am</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable racially,</v>

54
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a kind of throwing off of my racial</v>

55
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 1>equilibrium and I need to get back into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

56
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>And so I will do whatever it takes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>repel the challenge and get back into</v>

57
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that way,</v>

58
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I think white fragility functions as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of white racial bullying.</v>

59
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.410
<v Speaker 1>To be frank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we make it so miserable for people of</v>

60
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:54.691
<v Speaker 1>color to talk to us about are inevitable</v>
<v Speaker 1>and often unaware racist patterns that</v>

61
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:58.110
<v Speaker 1>we cannot help develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>from being socialized into a culture in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which racism is the bedrock and the</v>

63
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:03.034
<v Speaker 1>foundation.</v>

64
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 1>We make it so miserable for them to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>to us about it that most of the time</v>

65
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:08.880
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

66
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.880
<v Speaker 1>it just mean we just have to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that most people of color that are</v>

67
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.910
<v Speaker 1>working or living in primarily white</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment take home way more daily</v>

68
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:23.791
<v Speaker 1>slights and hurts and insults than they</v>
<v Speaker 1>bother talking to us about</v>

69
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.230
<v Speaker 1>because their experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to risk more punishment.</v>

70
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 1>They're going to lose the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have their experience</v>

71
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 1>minimized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explained away.</v>

72
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 1>They're going to cause the person to</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel attacked or hurt.</v>

73
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 1>And in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white fragility functions as a kind of</v>

74
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:48.850
<v Speaker 1>everyday white racial control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that has to be intentional or</v>

75
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:52.330
<v Speaker 1>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is how it functions and it's</v>

76
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:57.331
<v Speaker 1>actually incredibly liberating and</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformative to start from the premise</v>

77
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.330
<v Speaker 1>that of course I've internalized all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and then I can stop defending,</v>

78
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:04.840
<v Speaker 1>deflecting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>denying,</v>

79
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 1>hoping you won't notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>minimize and explaining.</v>

80
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 1>And I can just let go of that and get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

81
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.190
<v Speaker 1>And there's a question that's never</v>
<v Speaker 1>failed me in my efforts to unpack.</v>

82
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 1>How do we pull this off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do so many of us who are white</v>

83
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.150
<v Speaker 1>individually feel so free of racism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet we live in a society that is so</v>

84
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>profoundly separate and unequal by race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question that's never failed me</v>

85
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this true or is this false?</v>

86
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Is this right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is this wrong?</v>

87
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 1>But how does it function?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do these narratives that I tell,</v>

88
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.620
<v Speaker 1>how do they function when I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

89
00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm just an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we all just be individuals?</v>

90
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.750
<v Speaker 1>When I tell you I was taught to treat</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone the same when I tell you,</v>

91
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's focusing on race that divides</v>
<v Speaker 1>us when I tell you,</v>

92
00:05:56.621 --> 00:06:01.621
<v Speaker 1>but I have lots of friends of color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those narratives have not changed our</v>

93
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they function to take race off the</v>

94
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:12.641
<v Speaker 1>table and to exempt the person from any</v>
<v Speaker 1>further engagement and then doing that,</v>

95
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 1>they function to protect the current</v>
<v Speaker 1>racial hierarchy in the white position</v>

96
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 1>within it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be what I'm intending</v>

97
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is the impact of those</v>

98
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 1>narratives.</v>
