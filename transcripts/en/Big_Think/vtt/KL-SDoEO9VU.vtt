1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Have a very optimistic view of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of market work,</v>

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:08.931
<v Speaker 1>which sometime is associated to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Adam Smith is the view that you have</v>

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 1>self regulation of the market and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural forces,</v>

4
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:18.651
<v Speaker 1>natural market forces can take care of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and in particular can ensure</v>

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.080
<v Speaker 1>that inequality will never increase to</v>
<v Speaker 1>such an extent that it becomes socially</v>

6
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:30.621
<v Speaker 1>and economically and politically useless</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even dangerous for that matter.</v>

7
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Now I think in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

8
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:38.931
<v Speaker 1>if you reread the Adam's meets or if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to look at the economic developments</v>

9
00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:42.550
<v Speaker 1>route eastery you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>you cannot expect everything from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

11
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:49.110
<v Speaker 1>You cannot just rely on natural forces</v>
<v Speaker 1>to solve all problems.</v>

12
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:54.111
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the conclusion from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of political economy and the</v>

13
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 1>history of economic growth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality is that,</v>

14
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a strong public institutions in</v>

15
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:05.130
<v Speaker 1>order to put these poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full market forces,</v>

16
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.081
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

17
00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:08.400
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the right direction where market</v>

18
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:13.401
<v Speaker 1>forces can produce a lot of innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of incentives for [inaudible]</v>

19
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship.</v>

20
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.520
<v Speaker 1>And this is very positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would be a mistake to,</v>

21
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.320
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to rely on and count on these natural</v>

22
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 1>forces to sort of self regulate a</v>
<v Speaker 1>themself.</v>

23
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you look,</v>

24
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in in particular the period going to the</v>

25
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>financial crises of 2007,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2008,</v>

26
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>you have a very large concentration of</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic gains in poor,</v>

27
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.360
<v Speaker 1>relatively small group of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

28
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.660
<v Speaker 1>And I think everybody agrees today's as</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has contributed not only to the</v>

29
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:54.141
<v Speaker 1>stagnation of median household income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also to the rise of ouch all debt,</v>

30
00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>which in turn put pressure on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial system and probably did</v>

31
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:05.121
<v Speaker 1>contribute to fragilize the financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>system with consequences that we know in</v>

32
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>terms of financial crises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recession and unemployment,</v>

33
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>which we are now starting to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

34
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:17.820
<v Speaker 1>But there has been many years of lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth and the lost a lot of,</v>

35
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social suffering because of this.</v>

36
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.780
<v Speaker 1>So we need a strong public institutions</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to regulate this,</v>

37
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:28.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this market forces and the sometime,</v>

38
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's really accessive face in these</v>

39
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:34.070
<v Speaker 1>forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are cycles over history.</v>

40
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably after the Great Depression</v>

41
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 1>after World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people realize that market forces need</v>

42
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.520
<v Speaker 1>to be a strongly regulated and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting in the 70s and the 80s with the</v>

43
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 1>radio and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and touch our revolution.</v>

44
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:52.290
<v Speaker 1>And even more so after the fall of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union,</v>

45
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.680
<v Speaker 1>we entered in the 1990s and 2000 in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new cycle of sometime unlimited face</v>

46
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>into self regulation of markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to a large extent we are still in</v>

47
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>this phase and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I sing the reaction to policy</v>

48
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:14.851
<v Speaker 1>reaction to the financial crisis of 2007</v>
<v Speaker 1>2008 has been too limited so far.</v>

49
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>And this could happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

50
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:22.260
<v Speaker 1>we've asked a lot to our central banks</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the US,</v>

51
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.270
<v Speaker 1>in Europe and of course it's easy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>print a billions of dollars or billions</v>

52
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>of euros to avoid complete bankruptcy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the financial system,</v>

53
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>which is what happened in the 1930s and</v>
<v Speaker 1>which and dinner peanut complete</v>

54
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

55
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better to avoid that.</v>

56
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>printing money is not enough to solve</v>

57
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:46.370
<v Speaker 1>the structural problem that we need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell.</v>

58
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.201
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:50.960
<v Speaker 1>the good news is that we avoided the</v>
<v Speaker 1>complete bankruptcy and complete</v>

60
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the bad news is that we did not</v>

61
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:59.850
<v Speaker 1>really serve the structural problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which might in the future create a new</v>

62
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.833
<v Speaker 1>new crisis.</v>

63
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
