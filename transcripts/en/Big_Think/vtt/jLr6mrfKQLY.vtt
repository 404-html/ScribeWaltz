1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.280
<v Speaker 1>There is a shortage of people who have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology background and it's really</v>

2
00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:06.890
<v Speaker 1>becoming a business problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the number of things.</v>

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that ceos complain about,</v>

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.700
<v Speaker 1>two members of Congress when I see them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's difficult to get visas.</v>

5
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.150
<v Speaker 1>So you might have someone from Pakistan</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has a master's in computer science,</v>

6
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to come to United States and get a</v>

7
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:21.560
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that that's credibly</v>

8
00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:25.970
<v Speaker 1>beneficial for our economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if he doesn't come here and millions</v>

9
00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:28.520
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what companies will do is end up</v>

10
00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:33.521
<v Speaker 1>employing people in other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is okay from my selfish interest,</v>

11
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 1>but not as good for the country overall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

12
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an enormous outsource community</v>

13
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.380
<v Speaker 1>in India with hundreds of thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

14
00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:44.660
<v Speaker 1>which is fantastic for India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm supportive of that.</v>

15
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.200
<v Speaker 1>But putting on my us hat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to have many of those people in</v>

16
00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:49.500
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.250
<v Speaker 1>working for companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating jobs and then at some point</v>

18
00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:56.030
<v Speaker 1>spinning off and starting new companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anything we can do that it is more</v>

19
00:00:56.031 --> 00:00:57.770
<v Speaker 1>training and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.370
<v Speaker 1>and more visas for qualified people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is great for this country.</v>
