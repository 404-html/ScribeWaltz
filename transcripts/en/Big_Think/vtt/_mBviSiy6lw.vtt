00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.270
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in the suburbs of New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very fortunate in that I had a</v>

2
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.260
<v Speaker 1>really good public education and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>public education actually led me to the</v>

3
00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:26.801
<v Speaker 1>Rockefeller when I was 16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was passionate about biology and the</v>

4
00:00:29.871 --> 00:00:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Rockefeller has a series which they</v>
<v Speaker 1>still have of lectures called the</v>

5
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>holiday lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are lectures for high school</v>

6
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:38.960
<v Speaker 1>students right after Christmas and now I</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess there's a whole sort of internet</v>

7
00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:40.640
<v Speaker 1>way of getting the tickets if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested.</v>

8
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.440
<v Speaker 1>But then that wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet didn't exist so the.</v>

9
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.620
<v Speaker 1>The way that they were distributed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>each high school in the area got to and</v>

10
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.070
<v Speaker 1>so they were quite quite a valuable</v>
<v Speaker 1>commodity at my high school among the</v>

11
00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:57.071
<v Speaker 1>students who were interested and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>given one and so I guess it was in 1976</v>

12
00:00:57.441 --> 00:01:00.650
<v Speaker 1>in December.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the great fortune of hearing</v>

13
00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:05.651
<v Speaker 1>Christian to do speak about the cell and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gave this amazing tour of the</v>

14
00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:09.650
<v Speaker 1>interior of the stem cell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I could probably sit here and</v>

15
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:11.360
<v Speaker 1>spend about an hour telling you about.</v>

16
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Which is kind of amazing because it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>so long ago.</v>

17
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:19.520
<v Speaker 1>But it was a brilliant lecture and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact the lecture is referred to in a</v>

18
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:24.521
<v Speaker 1>book that he wrote called vital dust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also a wonderful book,</v>

19
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>but I was just inspired and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

20
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.680
<v Speaker 1>at that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that this was what I wanted to</v>

21
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:32.510
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he didn't know what that moment</v>

22
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the place that I was getting</v>

23
00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:36.410
<v Speaker 1>ended up doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't ever dream that I would be that</v>

24
00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:40.520
<v Speaker 1>fortunate and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a series of coincidence,</v>

25
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.510
<v Speaker 1>coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a summer job with a young</v>

26
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:48.440
<v Speaker 1>investigator at the time who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>studying dendritic cells,</v>

27
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.860
<v Speaker 1>which was something nobody had ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard of because he had discovered them.</v>

28
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>This was 1976 and Ralph Steinman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was my mentor then in my mentor now</v>

29
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.920
<v Speaker 1>discover dendritic cells in 1971 or 72.</v>

30
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.340
<v Speaker 1>The first publications were Njm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Journal of experimental medicine in</v>

31
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:08.900
<v Speaker 1>1973.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I came into the lab and he had one</v>

32
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:12.530
<v Speaker 1>technician and he was at the bench and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was free labor.</v>

33
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.980
<v Speaker 1>So he was in his now rather frugal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I learned to work in laboratory with</v>

34
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:21.800
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was wonderful because shortly</v>

35
00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:23.180
<v Speaker 1>after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably two years after that,</v>

36
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:28.181
<v Speaker 1>he stopped doing benchwork himself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was remarkable in that he'd made an</v>

37
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:33.200
<v Speaker 1>observation that other people didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe and he had the ability and the</v>

38
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:36.620
<v Speaker 1>tenacity to stick with that observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People thought that the,</v>

39
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.360
<v Speaker 1>the primary antigen presenting cell in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body or the cell that would show</v>

40
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.620
<v Speaker 1>other cells anything foreign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what an antigen is,</v>

41
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.310
<v Speaker 1>was the macrophage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Ralph had discovered dendritic cells</v>

42
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.820
<v Speaker 1>in cultures of macrophages and dendritic</v>
<v Speaker 1>cells are really potent.</v>

43
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>You only need like one or are literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need like literally 100.</v>

44
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>And so when he saw something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody else believed him.</v>

45
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>But Dr Cohen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was his mentor did and they were</v>

46
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>tenacious and stuck with it.</v>
