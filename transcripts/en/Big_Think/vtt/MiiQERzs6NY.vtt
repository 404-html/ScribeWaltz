1
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>I think what I've really been interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in is I'm trying to make the government</v>

2
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm impressed with how big and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated this country is.</v>

4
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I graduated from high school,</v>

5
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:26.070
<v Speaker 1>we had 130 million people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

6
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.901
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

7
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the figure is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I saw a few months ago that</v>

8
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:34.500
<v Speaker 1>we now exceed 300 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

9
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:37.560
<v Speaker 1>in my working lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country has more than doubled in</v>

10
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but much,</v>

11
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:44.001
<v Speaker 1>much more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is become extremely diverse as a</v>

12
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:48.780
<v Speaker 1>country and how you keep this country</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

13
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether this nation so conceived and so</v>

14
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>dedicated can long endure is Lincoln</v>
<v Speaker 1>said it got us Berg.</v>

15
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.920
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that question was the operative question</v>

16
00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:02.910
<v Speaker 1>that got us a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still the operative question,</v>

17
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>whether we can keep this country</v>
<v Speaker 1>together prosperous,</v>

18
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free,</v>

19
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the challenge.</v>

20
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.200
<v Speaker 1>And my passion I guess has always been</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

21
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.390
<v Speaker 1>to see how I can contribute to making</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country work better.</v>

22
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of things in American life</v>

23
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:29.481
<v Speaker 1>and American society that a disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a marvelous country and,</v>

24
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been given a marvelous heritage,</v>

25
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>terrific resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great opportunities.</v>

26
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know of anyone who lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>here who wants to live in another</v>

27
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know millions of people who live</v>

28
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere who would like to come here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you begin with gratitude,</v>

29
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for what you have,</v>

30
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>but you also have to recognize our</v>
<v Speaker 1>shortcomings.</v>

31
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a political system today that's</v>

32
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:59.301
<v Speaker 1>not working very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just defeated an immigration bill.</v>

33
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>We cannot figure out how to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare to everybody in this country.</v>

34
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have an education system that is</v>

35
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:11.970
<v Speaker 1>deficient in so many ways that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.960
<v Speaker 1>constantly come to our attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The infrastructure of the country is</v>

37
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>crumbling in many respects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The institutions are not working as well</v>

38
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>as we would like them to work.</v>

39
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>So I think the challenges are immense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

40
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't look at all of this and conclude</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hopeless or I'm a pessimist or</v>

41
00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>anything of the sort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do have a real sense of the</v>

42
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:37.980
<v Speaker 1>challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And neither am I starry eyed optimist.</v>

43
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see a lot of people who,</v>

44
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.190
<v Speaker 1>who portray a kind of a false optimism</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is not based on fact really,</v>

45
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

46
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.640
<v Speaker 1>in the problems that we confront.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just liked the traditional hard</v>

47
00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>headed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic,</v>

48
00:02:56.041 --> 00:03:01.041
<v Speaker 1>old fashioned approach of Americans who</v>
<v Speaker 1>see their country in their community as</v>

49
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they want to make it better.</v>

50
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.350
<v Speaker 1>But I don't see how any American can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with our healthcare system</v>

51
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

52
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.450
<v Speaker 1>given the fact that so many of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens are not covered here.</v>

53
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>We have the most marvelous medicine in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world if you can pay for it.</v>

54
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.920
<v Speaker 1>But so many Americans do not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a janitor who comes to my office</v>

55
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.273
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.670
<v Speaker 1>cleans it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.920
<v Speaker 1>he's a nice man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

58
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>his teeth are falling out.</v>

59
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I go to the dentist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>I get a bill $500,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$1,000 for a routine checkup.</v>

61
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>I can pay that fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can pay it for my family.</v>

62
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Here we are in the United States of</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

63
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>richest country in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can't get good dental care for</v>

64
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 1>the janitor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm disturbed by those things or take</v>

65
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>

66
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 1>I used to go to high schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give speeches.</v>

67
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:13.480
<v Speaker 1>All the times politicians do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd look out over that high school group</v>

68
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 1>and we'd had an interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My fractions may not be right here,</v>

69
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 1>but 50% of those kids I don't need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about.</v>

70
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come from good homes.</v>

71
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 1>They go to their churches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have good healthcare,</v>

72
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 1>they're involved in their community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may not all be a students,</v>

73
00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 1>but they're doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of them are a students and we're</v>

74
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 1>not going to screw those kids up.</v>

75
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>They're going to make it and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do well in life.</v>

76
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>What bothers me is that other half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

77
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:50.470
<v Speaker 1>there was a time when we were so good</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so strong and so powerful as a</v>

78
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't really need to worry too</v>

79
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:57.961
<v Speaker 1>much about that other half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's changing now and we've got to</v>

80
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 1>begin to bring them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means the educational system</v>

81
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:06.661
<v Speaker 1>has to be sharply improved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I worry about these things and many,</v>

82
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 1>many others who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can possibly be comfortable or</v>

83
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:15.580
<v Speaker 1>satisfied with the performance of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States Congress today.</v>

84
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't care whether you're a Democrat</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Republican,</v>

85
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 1>we cannot solve the immigration bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took up a bill.</v>

86
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Not wasn't a perfect bill for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

87
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.710
<v Speaker 1>rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we,</v>

88
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.920
<v Speaker 1>we have a huge problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't solve it.</v>

89
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.470
<v Speaker 1>And these other things we haven't been</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to solve.</v>

90
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.070
<v Speaker 1>So I think we have a failure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>political leadership in the country.</v>

91
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.470
<v Speaker 1>And I don't put that in the context of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the George Bush presidency.</v>

92
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 1>I put it in the context of the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>several decades.</v>

93
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:55.981
<v Speaker 1>This system is not working as well as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>should.</v>

94
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 1>And I began this program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that my interest was in making</v>

95
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>the country work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it still is.</v>

96
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.790
<v Speaker 1>And I think the challenges ahead of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry man.</v>
