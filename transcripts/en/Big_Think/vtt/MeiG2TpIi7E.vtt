1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.300
<v Speaker 1>The Arctic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wash for centuries,</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>largely unknown,</v>

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.520
<v Speaker 1>very remote part of the Western world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was only 100 years ago that to</v>

4
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.370
<v Speaker 1>discover is starting to go to the North</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pole and to these remote areas and then</v>

5
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:27.651
<v Speaker 1>the cold war or close to the Arctic in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of military confrontation and the</v>

6
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>conflict between the Soviet Union on one</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>

7
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>the western powers on the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

8
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember when we look at the Arctic and</v>

9
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:44.991
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of the 21st century is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is show recently that we as</v>

10
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:53.211
<v Speaker 1>mankind have been able to come together</v>
<v Speaker 1>to discuss on the site what do we do</v>

11
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>with respect to the Arctic future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no part of planet us,</v>

12
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.130
<v Speaker 1>which are so recently arrived on our</v>
<v Speaker 1>desk as a challenge and as an</v>

13
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:13.770
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So therefore the corporation in the</v>

14
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Arctic is one of the most crucial issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 21st century.</v>

15
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>For many reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One age that uh,</v>

16
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>this is the front line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no climate change.</v>

17
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.860
<v Speaker 1>The aggression melting of the ice in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arctic will have consequences all over</v>

18
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've only our quarter of the</v>

19
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>greenland ice sheet melts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This will lead to two meters rising sea</v>

20
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:46.011
<v Speaker 1>levels everywhere in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And already we are seeing that the</v>

21
00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:52.211
<v Speaker 1>present melting of the Arctic Sea ice is</v>
<v Speaker 1>causing extreme weather events in the</v>

22
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Asia,</v>

23
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.850
<v Speaker 1>I than other parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In audition,</v>

24
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.590
<v Speaker 1>the Arctic is one of the richest parts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world in terms of untapped</v>

25
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.620
<v Speaker 1>natural resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with the continuous melting of the</v>

26
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Arctic Sea ice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:16.491
<v Speaker 1>there will be a new shipping lines</v>
<v Speaker 1>linking Asia to America and Europe in a</v>

28
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Suez Canal on the Panama Canal.</v>

29
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.840
<v Speaker 1>That in his time a lot of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the Arctic has now become the new</v>

30
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 1>economic and political playing field.</v>

31
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.460
<v Speaker 1>In 2015 the United States takes on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chairmanship of the Arctic Council.</v>

32
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.740
<v Speaker 1>It is the first time we change the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arctic Council became a treaty making</v>

33
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the US takes on that responsibility</v>

34
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.200
<v Speaker 1>and the chairmanship is not the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.360
<v Speaker 1>a formal role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

36
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.040
<v Speaker 1>it's just supposed to provide a vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:02:57.041 --> 00:03:02.041
<v Speaker 1>a policy agenda and a direction towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future joints.</v>

38
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.800
<v Speaker 1>And very important that all the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States or introduced it in</v>

39
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>climate change or interested in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

40
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>realize that in the next two or three</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

41
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.330
<v Speaker 1>the US will be in the leadership role</v>
<v Speaker 1>with respect to the future of the</v>

42
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Arctic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

43
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>in partnership with other Arctic</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries as well as the option of the</v>

44
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>states from Asia and Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the Arctic council liaison</v>

45
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.500
<v Speaker 1>intergovernmental body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a role for activists and</v>

46
00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 1>environmentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a expert scientist,</v>

47
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>ordinary people in this process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in order to facilitate that together</v>

48
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>with many other partners from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arctic,</v>

49
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:50.860
<v Speaker 1>I established last year what's called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Arctic Circle,</v>

50
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.400
<v Speaker 1>which is a kind of a on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>international assembly where everybody,</v>

51
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:00.660
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an individual or citizen or,</v>

52
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.030
<v Speaker 1>or government or corporation or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific institute or university or</v>

53
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 1>activist group can come together where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody has the same role,</v>

54
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>the same rights to speak on and discuss.</v>

55
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 1>So I would encourage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the next two or three years,</v>

56
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 1>everybody who is concerned about these</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues in the United States.</v>

57
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at the Arctic circle on the</v>

58
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 1>website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arctic circle.org and see if you want to</v>

59
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 1>come to the assembly or if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>attend the forum meetings that will take</v>

60
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:39.061
<v Speaker 1>place in the United States in Greenland</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Singapore as well as Iceland in the</v>

61
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 1>next 12 to 18 months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'll,</v>

62
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Speaker 1>we'll all be aware that your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

63
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.900
<v Speaker 1>the United States of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well from 2015 2017 be the leader in</v>

64
00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:02.641
<v Speaker 1>making policy and agreement and map out</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future for that part of planet does,</v>

65
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>where climate change is most</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressively taking place.</v>

66
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.280
<v Speaker 1>There was a big great march in New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the climate at hundreds and</v>

67
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.250
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people participated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if many of them realized</v>

68
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.520
<v Speaker 1>that in the early months of next year it</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be the u s who will chair the</v>

69
00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:33.991
<v Speaker 1>international cooperation on that part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mother Earth where climate change is</v>

70
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:37.060
<v Speaker 1>most aggressively taking place.</v>
