00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.543
<v Speaker 1>No</v>

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.300
<v Speaker 1>world of acquiring work for an auction</v>
<v Speaker 1>catalog is,</v>

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>it's quite hilarious because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely this insane high,</v>

4
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:21.621
<v Speaker 1>low aspect to everything that we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>because on one hand there is very much</v>

5
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>that kind of populist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm making somebody rich overnight</v>

6
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>appeal to putting together an auction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very addictive.</v>

7
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing greater than,</v>

8
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the proverbial elderly lady in Rock</v>

9
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Chester writes you and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>I saw you on some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Internet site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like you're,</v>

12
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>I have this piece of furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this by,</v>

13
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carla Molino,</v>

14
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.010
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

15
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents acquired it at a department</v>

16
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>store and 1938 in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is,</v>

17
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's that aspect.</v>

18
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:03.560
<v Speaker 1>We have a one off relationship with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

19
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.400
<v Speaker 1>the client that pulls the declaration of</v>
<v Speaker 1>independence out of their basement.</v>

20
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>At the other time you have longterm</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships with pickers.</v>

21
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>The guys in vans who'd go out there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>find the stuff that people are not savvy</v>

22
00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>enough to call us about the stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes through a state sales,</v>

23
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that ends up in foreclosure</v>
<v Speaker 1>auctions.</v>

24
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>The things that get put left out by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>side of the road.</v>

25
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.620
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have a good network of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

26
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.280
<v Speaker 1>of dudes and vans in the postwar design</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

27
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>you're finished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've got to maintain excellent</v>

28
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>relationships with them so that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring the peace to you and not to your</v>

29
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>competitors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on the other side,</v>

30
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:42.460
<v Speaker 1>the high side of the coin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing more exciting than</v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting with curators in a museum who've</v>

32
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>decided to deaccession apiece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who've decided that,</v>

33
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:54.060
<v Speaker 1>this piece isn't right for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>collection and they would like to sell</v>

35
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>that piece to bring more money into</v>
<v Speaker 1>create,</v>

36
00:01:57.331 --> 00:01:58.164
<v Speaker 1>get more pieces.</v>

37
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in December we sold a grand piano by</v>

38
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Gilbert Rhodey from the Museum of Modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>Art's collection.</v>

39
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.540
<v Speaker 1>And the piano had been in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>auditorium and was being used by the</v>

40
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Department of film to accompany silent</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

41
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 1>But as a piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a piano.</v>

42
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.860
<v Speaker 1>And even though this was an extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>rare piece by a very unsung 1930s</v>

43
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>American industrial designer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a piano and piano is very,</v>

44
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>very hard thing for a museum to display.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they sold it with us.</v>

45
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing more exciting than,</v>

46
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having that kind of provenance.</v>

47
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.691
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

48
00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:36.070
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when putting together a catalog and,</v>

49
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>and finally we were working with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.360
<v Speaker 1>I continue to work with some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>great collectors out there and with</v>

51
00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

52
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 1>they already know much more than I do in</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of these areas.</v>

53
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>It's more a question of meeting with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and going,</v>

54
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:49.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you know,</v>

56
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 2>you want to sell right?</v>
