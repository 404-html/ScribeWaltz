1
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>So consumer electronics has been an</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing cross industry for the last few</v>

2
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.830
<v Speaker 1>We've seen this tremendous explosion in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of digital TV's in people's homes</v>

4
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>and mobile devices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now people with two,</v>

5
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:26.070
<v Speaker 1>three cell phones are the types of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mobile devices we're seeing net books</v>

6
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's been this big growth of</v>

7
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.770
<v Speaker 1>devices out there and that's obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a big part of Samsung.</v>

8
00:00:32.771 --> 00:00:35.550
<v Speaker 1>It's rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now what we see is more of a</v>

9
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:40.551
<v Speaker 1>transformation to consumer experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's less and less about the hardware</v>

10
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:44.820
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more about the emotional connection</v>

11
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the experience of using the</v>

12
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your user experience,</v>

13
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:51.780
<v Speaker 1>you Ui,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ux,</v>

14
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>that's becoming more important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

15
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>the interface is much more significant</v>
<v Speaker 1>than in the past.</v>

16
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Design is a more important element to</v>
<v Speaker 1>doc can feel.</v>

17
00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Touch of products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

18
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>my favorite example is the TV used to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big box.</v>

19
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.340
<v Speaker 1>You had hideaway in the corner of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

20
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Now it's something sleek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like a picture you want to hang</v>

21
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>up on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're seeing that we're seeing more</v>

22
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>applications coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>content and services delivered through</v>

23
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>devices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a cell phone started off being about</v>

24
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>just talking to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's much more about the content and</v>

25
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>services that you can get through that</v>
<v Speaker 1>device.</v>

26
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.250
<v Speaker 1>So that's really where we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see in 2010 I think a big evolution,</v>

27
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.100
<v Speaker 1>which is now that now that all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>devices are out there,</v>

28
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.430
<v Speaker 1>we're going to see much more about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>service and the experience that's</v>

29
00:01:44.431 --> 00:01:48.990
<v Speaker 1>delivered design or be more important</v>
<v Speaker 1>user interface will be more important</v>

30
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>and all the kind of content that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get through these various devices.</v>

31
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right that the emotional feedback</v>

32
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:04.221
<v Speaker 1>is becoming much more important than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be about a device for a devices</v>

33
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's much more about what you can do</v>

34
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

35
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>what does it do for me as a consumer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we think about the,</v>

36
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 1>the experience of using that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why we do a lot of</v>

37
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>research now to really understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumer needs and consumer tastes and</v>

38
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 1>unmet needs of consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

39
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>we've really evolved in the consumer</v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic space from being very</v>

40
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:33.651
<v Speaker 1>technology driven to being almost like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumer product or package goods</v>

41
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>industry where it's really about how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage our brand and how we gain</v>

42
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>insights about consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have a big effort in terms of</v>

43
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:48.141
<v Speaker 1>market insights and consumer research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I had up here in North America to</v>

44
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:50.880
<v Speaker 1>get out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what consumers are looking</v>

45
00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the unmet needs or not.</v>

46
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.710
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you one example which is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>move content between different devices.</v>

47
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was out recently taking photos,</v>

48
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family for those on vacation.</v>

49
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>We get back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pull out the card,</v>

50
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.940
<v Speaker 1>put it into my pc and we all stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>around a 20 inch monitor looking at</v>

51
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>these photos in the room next door</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 55 inch tv.</v>

52
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 1>That's where I want to watch the photos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we need to make it much easier to</v>

53
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.640
<v Speaker 1>move content between different devices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big screens for certain content pieces</v>

54
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 1>for certain content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mobile phone for certain content.</v>

55
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>So those kinds of insights that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get from the way in which consumers use</v>

56
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:35.650
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

57
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>and also the things they want to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>products.</v>

58
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>That's where we can really get benefit.</v>
