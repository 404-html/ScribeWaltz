1
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>So consumer electronics has been amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth industry for the last few years,</v>

2
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've seen this tremendous explosion</v>

3
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.090
<v Speaker 1>terms of digital TV's and people's homes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mobile devices now,</v>

4
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>people with two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three cell phones,</v>

5
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>other types of mobile devices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing net books and so on.</v>

6
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:31.290
<v Speaker 1>So there's been this big growth of</v>
<v Speaker 1>devices out there and that's obviously</v>

7
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:35.580
<v Speaker 1>been a big part of Samsung that's rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now what we see as more of a</v>

8
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:40.581
<v Speaker 1>transformation to consumer experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's less and less about the hardware</v>

9
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:44.820
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more about the emotional connection</v>

10
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the experience of using the</v>

11
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you user experience,</v>

12
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:52.680
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a ux that's becoming more</v>

13
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>the interface is much more significant</v>
<v Speaker 1>than in the past.</v>

15
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.070
<v Speaker 1>Design is a more important element to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look and feel.</v>

16
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Touch of products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

17
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>my favorite example is the TV used to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big box.</v>

18
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>You would hide away in the corner of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

19
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Now it's something sleek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like a picture you want to hang</v>

20
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>up on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're seeing that we're seeing more</v>

21
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>applications coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>content and services delivered through</v>

22
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>devices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a cell phone started off being about</v>

23
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>just talking to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's much more about the content and</v>

24
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>services that you can get through that</v>
<v Speaker 1>device.</v>

25
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 1>So that's really where we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see in 2010,</v>

26
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:37.881
<v Speaker 1>I think a big evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is now that now that all these</v>

27
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:42.660
<v Speaker 1>devices out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to see much more about the</v>

28
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 1>service and the experience that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivered design or be more important</v>

29
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.150
<v Speaker 1>user interface will be more important</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the kinds of content that you</v>

30
00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>can get through these various devices.</v>

31
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right that the emotional feedback</v>

32
00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:04.231
<v Speaker 1>is becoming much more important than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be about a device for devices</v>

33
00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:07.810
<v Speaker 1>sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's much more about what you can do</v>

34
00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

35
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.620
<v Speaker 1>what does it do for me as a consumer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think about the,</v>

36
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.010
<v Speaker 1>the experience of using that and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why we do a lot of research now</v>

37
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.530
<v Speaker 1>to really understand consumer needs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumer tastes and unmet needs of</v>

38
00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:28.390
<v Speaker 1>consumers know we've really evolved in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consumer electronic space from being</v>

39
00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:33.391
<v Speaker 1>very technology driven to being almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a consumer product or package goods</v>

40
00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:38.950
<v Speaker 1>industry where it's really about how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage our brand and how we gain</v>

41
00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:43.150
<v Speaker 1>insights about consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have a big effort in terms of</v>

42
00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:48.151
<v Speaker 1>market insights and consumer research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I head up here in North America to</v>

43
00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:50.890
<v Speaker 1>get out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what consumers are looking</v>

44
00:02:50.891 --> 00:02:52.370
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the unmet needs are.</v>

45
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Now I'll give you one example which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move content between different</v>

46
00:02:57.401 --> 00:03:02.401
<v Speaker 1>devices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was out recently taking photos,</v>

47
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>family photos on vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get back,</v>

48
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I pull out the card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it into my pc and we all stand</v>

49
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:14.641
<v Speaker 1>around a 20 inch monitor looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>these photos in the room next door.</v>

50
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a 55 inch TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I want to watch the photos,</v>

51
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 1>so we need to make it much easier to</v>
<v Speaker 1>move content between different devices,</v>

52
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>big screens for certain content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pcs for certain content,</v>

53
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 1>mobile phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for certain content,</v>

54
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>so those kinds of insights that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get from the way in which consumers use</v>

55
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>product a and also the things they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with products.</v>

56
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>That's where we can really get benefit.</v>
