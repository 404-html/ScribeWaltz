00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>I became involved with the conservation</v>
<v Speaker 1>work and,</v>

2
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.483
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 2>through that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 2>Dr Wilson's Biodiversity Foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which aren't,</v>

5
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the board of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was clear to me that,</v>

6
00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:27.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

7
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mankind,</v>

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.820
<v Speaker 2>human activity was degrading our earth's</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources at an alarmingly rapid rate</v>

9
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.180
<v Speaker 2>and that we were losing species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

10
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.750
<v Speaker 2>right and left important species</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps.</v>

11
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some cases we knew in other cases we</v>

12
00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:49.660
<v Speaker 2>hadn't yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

13
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 2>full knowledge of a species or an</v>
<v Speaker 2>organism before it was lost.</v>

14
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.630
<v Speaker 2>It's my understanding that that much of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a much of our medicine,</v>

15
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 2>much of our food stuff that may be</v>
<v Speaker 2>required in the,</v>

16
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:12.740
<v Speaker 2>in the future will come from these</v>
<v Speaker 2>reserves of biodiversity,</v>

17
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 2>which are rapidly disappearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

18
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 2>and unless we have a fully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

19
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>protected,</v>

20
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

21
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.270
<v Speaker 2>bio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

22
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.100
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

23
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:31.790
<v Speaker 2>we will not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll lose the potential to learn how</v>

24
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:36.320
<v Speaker 2>nature works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that information may be critical in</v>

25
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:39.290
<v Speaker 2>our understanding of how to manipulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

26
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is in our power to manipulate to,</v>

27
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.290
<v Speaker 2>to save biodiversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>save,</v>

28
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power of our,</v>

29
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.210
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

30
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>planet to sustain life.</v>
