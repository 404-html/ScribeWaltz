00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Who would I like to interview?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually would like to interview some</v>

3
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:19.180
<v Speaker 1>of the leaders in developing countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.080
<v Speaker 1>like in South Africa for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>as one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just one of a few and try to</v>

6
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 1>get them to articulate to me why they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not doing certain things in their</v>

7
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:37.281
<v Speaker 1>country that everyone else seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate from the outside that they</v>

8
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they not paying much more</v>

9
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>attention to some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the suffering of the people in their own</v>

10
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>country now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may have a very good reason for it,</v>

11
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>but I'd like to pose the tough questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them as to why they aren't doing</v>

12
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
