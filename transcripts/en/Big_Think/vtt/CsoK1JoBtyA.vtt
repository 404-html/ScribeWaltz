1
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.020
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why computer security</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so hard is because you have to get</v>

2
00:00:06.021 --> 00:00:08.750
<v Speaker 1>absolutely everything right in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a secure system.</v>

3
00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:11.060
<v Speaker 1>And there's lots of different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you can get wrong.</v>

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Everything from your software was Buggy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your passwords were too weak,</v>

5
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.180
<v Speaker 1>you publish your passwords accidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hardware was insecure,</v>

6
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.800
<v Speaker 1>they user made a mistake and fell victim</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a phishing attack and gave their</v>

7
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>credentials to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>a foreign agent or a bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

9
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.240
<v Speaker 1>All of those things have to be done</v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly in order to have a secure</v>

10
00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:33.190
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.300
<v Speaker 1>It might seem tempting to think in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody has a cell phone,</v>

12
00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:38.600
<v Speaker 1>so you could just use your cell phone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do voting like we do for American idol</v>

13
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>or similar TV shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works for American idol because</v>

14
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.240
<v Speaker 1>nobody cares all that much who wins or</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't win.</v>

15
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.880
<v Speaker 1>If you get the wrong outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people will care,</v>

16
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:49.310
<v Speaker 1>but it won't affect sort of the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the country,</v>

17
00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:50.810
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.380
<v Speaker 1>it's not sensible to use cell phones for</v>
<v Speaker 1>voting for things that matter.</v>

19
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.770
<v Speaker 1>National elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

20
00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:02.390
<v Speaker 1>because the software on a phone is</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous and very complicated.</v>

21
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.580
<v Speaker 1>And so understanding that that code is</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct and actually counting all of the</v>

22
00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>votes appropriately would be a task that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>

23
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.610
<v Speaker 1>it's so complex is to be infeasible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have,</v>

24
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:15.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legitimate APP that it is designed</v>

25
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.870
<v Speaker 1>to correctly count the votes for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>

26
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>but somebody could hack into that set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>applications and,</v>

27
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:24.680
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and plant bugs in a bunch of different</v>

28
00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:27.560
<v Speaker 1>cell phones so that the final results</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

29
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the actual intent didn't actually</v>

30
00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:35.960
<v Speaker 1>capture the intensive all the voters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a system for voting that relies</v>

31
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:40.490
<v Speaker 1>entirely on computers to do all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>voting will never be secure because</v>

32
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.060
<v Speaker 1>you'll never have enough confidence that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the code that was running on those</v>

33
00:01:44.061 --> 00:01:48.470
<v Speaker 1>computers correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cow counted the votes as the person who</v>

34
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:49.400
<v Speaker 1>voted intended.</v>

35
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>There's always the chance that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were bugs or that a hacker came and</v>

36
00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:56.600
<v Speaker 1>changed the code or a corrupted the code</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make the result be what the hacker</v>

37
00:01:56.601 --> 00:01:58.400
<v Speaker 1>wanted instead of what the voters</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted.</v>

38
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things to know about how</v>

39
00:02:01.431 --> 00:02:05.870
<v Speaker 1>the U s election system works is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>voting machines are the purview of</v>

40
00:02:05.871 --> 00:02:09.230
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every state has their own process for</v>

41
00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:12.710
<v Speaker 1>deciding how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what technology to use to count votes.</v>

42
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.140
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not that there's not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>monoculture where every single votings</v>

43
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.960
<v Speaker 1>site has the same technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's determined on a state by state</v>

44
00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:23.030
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have 50 different state</v>

45
00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:27.200
<v Speaker 1>authorities at least who were deciding</v>
<v Speaker 1>what technology to use on for that</v>

46
00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:29.840
<v Speaker 1>particular state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are different technologies in</v>

47
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:32.840
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the technologies is just a</v>

48
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.380
<v Speaker 1>touchscreen where you go when you tap</v>
<v Speaker 1>the choices that you want and it records</v>

49
00:02:36.381 --> 00:02:37.550
<v Speaker 1>it in the computer program.</v>

50
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.160
<v Speaker 1>10 states currently have that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

51
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:44.330
<v Speaker 1>and from a cybersecurity perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>that technology is terrible because what</v>

52
00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:49.331
<v Speaker 1>computers do is exactly what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>told to do by the last person who loaded</v>

53
00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:52.100
<v Speaker 1>code onto the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people who don't know very much</v>

54
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:55.160
<v Speaker 1>about computers tend to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>computers do the right thing,</v>

55
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.070
<v Speaker 1>but in fact they just do exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're told to do.</v>

56
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>So if they're told to do the correct</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing by a person who has the authority</v>

57
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>to tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's great.</v>

58
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 1>But that's often not what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The voting systems that just have the</v>

59
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>touch screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way of auditing what happened</v>

60
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 1>retroactively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just a question of,</v>

61
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did the system actually counted</v>

62
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 1>correctly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

63
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 1>All you have at the end of the day is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the collection of,</v>

64
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>of totals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So somebody could have replaced the</v>

65
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hacked in and made it count in a</v>

66
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>slightly skewed way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a very skewed way.</v>

67
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>You really have no way of telling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that technology is bad.</v>

68
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>People pretty much know that technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>is bad and it's being phased out.</v>

69
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>So no one is trying to buy more of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines at this point and they're no</v>

70
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>longer being manufactured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're trending in a good direction as</v>

71
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 1>far as that's concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

72
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.350
<v Speaker 1>a different kind of machine or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>optical scanning machines where you fill</v>

73
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like a scan tron form from</v>

74
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>elementary school where you fill out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple choice questions on the form</v>

75
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>and then the form is read electronically</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now the program that's doing the</v>

76
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>reading has all the problems of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>system that I talked about before where</v>

77
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>it is software that scanning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>counting and could be buggy,</v>

78
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>could be corrupted by somebody who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hacking in,</v>

79
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>but you still have that paper records so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go back after the fact and audit</v>

80
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Speaker 1>to confirm that the report that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount,</v>

81
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>the total that was reported was actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>the correct and so that that post facto</v>

82
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 1>audit and capability is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

83
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Most states use this technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now some states have in place an</v>

84
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:25.960
<v Speaker 1>automatic auditing process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so independent of whether any candidate</v>

85
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 1>asks for an audit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go and pick some number of the</v>

86
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:32.560
<v Speaker 1>voting districts and some number of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ballots and they checked to make sure</v>

87
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>that the counting process was correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think probably the level of auditing</v>

88
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:39.040
<v Speaker 1>isn't sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There needs to be broader auditing and</v>

89
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>more random auditing going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely a step in the right</v>

90
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The principle that people in this who</v>

91
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.470
<v Speaker 1>work in this area talk about is they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to make sure that they can</v>

92
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Speaker 1>guarantee the results are correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if a nefarious person wrote the</v>

93
00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:55.510
<v Speaker 1>code that did the counting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it has to work,</v>

94
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 1>even if the software was completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>buggy.</v>

95
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.310
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 1>optical scanning reading technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfies that characteristic because</v>

97
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:07.711
<v Speaker 1>even if the code that does the fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the counting of the scan tron form is</v>

98
00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 1>buggy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can go look at the physical forms</v>

99
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>and figure out that there was a mistake</v>
<v Speaker 1>and correct it using different software.</v>

100
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.710
<v Speaker 1>So there an audibility capability that</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists in that,</v>

101
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.610
<v Speaker 1>that kind of technology that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>exist if you have no paper trail.</v>

102
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>So I think at this point we kind of know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to do it.</v>

103
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.940
<v Speaker 1>And from a tactical point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the question is getting the states</v>

104
00:05:27.941 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 1>all to shift to that new kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

105
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.953
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

106
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
