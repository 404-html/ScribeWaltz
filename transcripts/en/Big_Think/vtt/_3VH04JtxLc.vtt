1
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I had been to Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.480
<v Speaker 1>previously that was my first covering of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a war,</v>

4
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.990
<v Speaker 1>but I had written for rolling stone for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a few years.</v>

5
00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:28.340
<v Speaker 1>And the short answer is I would always </v>
<v Speaker 1>write about youth subcultures,</v>

6
00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 1>like skateboarders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminals,</v>

7
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.760
<v Speaker 1>radical environmentalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I pitched my editor the idea that,</v>

8
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.020
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll cover the military.</v>

9
00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:38.300
<v Speaker 1>It's another youth sub culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.523
<v Speaker 1>but I think the other reason I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to Iraq because I studied history in </v>

11
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:45.200
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fascinated by it more actually.</v>

12
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.790
<v Speaker 1>And I had also previously worked at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hustler magazine as a,</v>

13
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.860
<v Speaker 1>as an editor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an editor there.</v>

14
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.753
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always felt that when I worked at </v>

15
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:56.474
<v Speaker 1>Hustler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are beneficiaries of the first </v>

16
00:00:57.651 --> 00:00:59.090
<v Speaker 1>amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

17
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>now here's another way to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live the first amendment.</v>

19
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:05.174
<v Speaker 1>The military is giving me the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to cover the war from the </v>

20
00:01:07.491 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 1>front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I feel it.</v>

21
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first covered troops,</v>

22
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.720
<v Speaker 1>it was in Afghanistan and I was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>

23
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.560
<v Speaker 1>I spent a month with a heavy weapons </v>
<v Speaker 1>platoon in Kandahar.</v>

24
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 1>And with those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always sort of like,</v>

25
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:33.980
<v Speaker 1>should I let them know that I worked for</v>
<v Speaker 1>hustler cause I thought maybe they'll be</v>

26
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>angry or some it'll offend some born </v>
<v Speaker 1>again Christian or something.</v>

27
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.653
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got out and it really increased my </v>

28
00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:45.260
<v Speaker 1>respect and acceptance in that platoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the time I got to Iraq or to,</v>

29
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.900
<v Speaker 1>to the Marine Corp prior to the invasion</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Iraq,</v>

30
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.063
<v Speaker 1>I kind of knew in a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a manipulative journalistic way that </v>

31
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>hustler was a good card to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.590
<v Speaker 1>but it's more of a humorous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

33
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.200
<v Speaker 1>I knew that they would laugh about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.093
<v Speaker 1>what really I think made them accept me </v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as they did and not everyone </v>

35
00:02:05.871 --> 00:02:06.704
<v Speaker 1>accepted me was just the fact that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>stayed with them and I believe in </v>

36
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:11.300
<v Speaker 1>journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing beats,</v>

37
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and persistence.</v>

38
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Just follow people around and they kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

39
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:17.624
<v Speaker 1>it breaks down the barriers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that I followed them around </v>

40
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>after we were getting shot at and ambush</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course also helps.</v>

41
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.933
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.970
<v Speaker 1>In Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had some rocket attacks and there are</v>

43
00:02:36.971 --> 00:02:39.430
<v Speaker 1>big issues with land mines that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>blowing people up.</v>

44
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.300
<v Speaker 1>That was a different sort of tension the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>

45
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.680
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a worst,</v>

46
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.473
<v Speaker 1>just the fear of the fear of landmines </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we had in Afghanistan was worse </v>

47
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.143
<v Speaker 1>than actually being shot at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first time I was really shot at </v>

48
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>was at the bridge at Nasiriyah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will be depicted in episode of the</v>

49
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>mini series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

50
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>strangely enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very exciting.</v>

51
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.590
<v Speaker 1>And it was strangely enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

52
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was voiced by marines that were</v>

53
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>by my side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

54
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just like a movie.</v>

55
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.183
<v Speaker 1>And it's weird to me that my reference </v>
<v Speaker 1>point and their reference point was </v>

56
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the case.</v>

57
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean to see,</v>

58
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:23.944
<v Speaker 1>and for some reason to have like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortar blow up sort of near you and you </v>

60
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:31.861
<v Speaker 1>feel the overpressure and you to see a </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine gun fire tearing into trees over</v>

61
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 1>your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's scary.</v>

62
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:36.124
<v Speaker 1>It's very exciting.</v>

63
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

64
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all dangerous.</v>

65
00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:52.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you start getting shot at,</v>

66
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

67
00:03:53.761 --> 00:03:56.520
<v Speaker 1>But who knows what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me,</v>

68
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.740
<v Speaker 1>this happened time and time again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were in a convoy moving forward.</v>

69
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:06.741
<v Speaker 1>So at times a unit would have moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead of us and they would say,</v>

70
00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:07.794
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have enemy contact in </v>

71
00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:12.570
<v Speaker 1>five minutes when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you reached this turn in the road.</v>

72
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.360
<v Speaker 1>So then you're in the Humvee and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

73
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.220
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last guys that drove up here,</v>

74
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.360
<v Speaker 1>they took rpg and machine gun fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen to you next.</v>

75
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.090
<v Speaker 1>It was the anticipation that was always </v>
<v Speaker 1>the scariest.</v>

76
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I came back from Iraq,</v>

77
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of my friends were like,</v>

78
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.153
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.420
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were in combat.</v>

80
00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 1>It must be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw something that no one else could</v>

81
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>ever understand unless they've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

82
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:47.044
<v Speaker 1>And actually I disagreed with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weirdest thing is there was an </v>

83
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:55.321
<v Speaker 1>element of being in combat that </v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmed to me what I'd read about it.</v>

84
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.510
<v Speaker 1>And I'd read studied history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd read a lot about it.</v>

85
00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.613
<v Speaker 1>And it was weird as a writer and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who's sort of live the life of </v>

86
00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:04.600
<v Speaker 1>the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

87
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:06.970
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really cool that my imagination did</v>

88
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:10.090
<v Speaker 1>actually prepare me for what combat </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be like.</v>

89
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.193
<v Speaker 1>So there was an element of it that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>very familiar based on my intense </v>

90
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:15.544
<v Speaker 1>reading as a history student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the one thing that I really saw in </v>

91
00:05:18.991 --> 00:05:23.991
<v Speaker 1>Iraq graphically and I'd never quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood was how attractive war is for</v>

92
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:26.410
<v Speaker 1>the combatants.</v>

93
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.603
<v Speaker 1>That basically in Iraq you had these </v>
<v Speaker 1>young Marines who had prepared for war </v>

94
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.530
<v Speaker 1>and it was pretty exciting for them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally get a chance to be in it.</v>

95
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.603
<v Speaker 1>And on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the people that were attacking </v>

96
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:42.880
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're professional Iraqi soldiers now,</v>

97
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:46.750
<v Speaker 1>many of them were actually working as </v>
<v Speaker 1>insurgents because the,</v>

98
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.010
<v Speaker 1>the Saddam's military had prepared for </v>
<v Speaker 1>an insurgency as we invaded,</v>

99
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.930
<v Speaker 1>but they were professional combatants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you had these young men on both sides</v>

100
00:05:55.931 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>that were sort of fulfilling their </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

101
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.281
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

102
00:06:00.281 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>it was very self actualizing for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marines,</v>

103
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 1>as I'm sure it was for the Iraqis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

104
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 1>and it was a war is attractive to those </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

105
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:12.350
<v Speaker 1>But in between is this massive civilians</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are being slaughtered,</v>

106
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>who are suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd never quite realized a,</v>

107
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

108
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.480
<v Speaker 1>for combatants war is kind of attractive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be that truly what happens in war is</v>

109
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 1>just civilians just get fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

110
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 1>there's no there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no glory.</v>

111
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing for them except for </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>

112
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:31.430
<v Speaker 1>misery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

113
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you really see it in Iraq.</v>

114
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:35.483
<v Speaker 1>I really saw it.</v>

115
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.313
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
