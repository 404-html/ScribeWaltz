1
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.900
<v Speaker 1>You obviously accomplished a lot before</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made mindfulness part of your life</v>

2
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.080
<v Speaker 1>more than most people accomplish in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives.</v>

3
00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:20.081
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that your clarity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking has changed in the last eight</v>

4
00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:21.160
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.920
<v Speaker 1>and is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't mindfulness necessary for clear</v>

6
00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:28.940
<v Speaker 1>thought or could you have it without it</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you did for so many years before?</v>

7
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Unquestionably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mindfulness enhances,</v>

8
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 2>as you've said in your book and our</v>
<v Speaker 2>clarity of thought.</v>

9
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 2>Unquestionably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both anecdotally and scientifically,</v>

10
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 2>we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can prove that point.</v>

11
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.600
<v Speaker 2>One of the main reasons is because by</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowing us to be in the moment,</v>

12
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.040
<v Speaker 2>it means we don't stay with what just</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and that's one of the reasons</v>

13
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 2>that Phil Jackson now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coach of the Knicks has given for</v>

14
00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:02.100
<v Speaker 2>making mindfulness mandatory as part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next training,</v>

15
00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 2>which I love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love having a lead athletes</v>

16
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 2>incorporating mindfulness into their</v>
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

17
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 2>And the reason Phil Jackson gave is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

18
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 2>you're always going to make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the field learning the court.</v>

19
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you then move on and be fully</v>

20
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 2>present?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>

21
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 2>you're going to carry that mistake with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and your actions and your decisions</v>

22
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 2>are going to be impaired because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

23
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same applies to life.</v>

24
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 2>If I'm still smarting over something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened that I'm not happy with</v>

25
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 2>WHO and when come when the moment comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>from me to make another decision or</v>

26
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:41.070
<v Speaker 2>react to something new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to affect that particular</v>

27
00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 2>moments decision.</v>

28
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that you mentioned</v>

29
00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:46.730
<v Speaker 1>professional athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that strikes me about</v>

30
00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:49.040
<v Speaker 1>the mindfulness research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you mentioned a lot of this in your</v>

31
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:52.460
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just how broadly it's been adapted.</v>

32
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not just athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the military,</v>

33
00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>different studies with mindfulness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have hedge fund managers like Ray</v>

34
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Daleo saying that that's part of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

35
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.310
<v Speaker 1>All of these people clearly have used it</v>
<v Speaker 1>after they reach a certain elite point</v>

36
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.130
<v Speaker 1>in their career and then they use</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindfulness to homeless,</v>

37
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:11.450
<v Speaker 1>transcend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:14.180
<v Speaker 1>to get a step further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the athlete who's not just a great</v>

39
00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:17.420
<v Speaker 1>athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who can overcome the problems in the</v>

40
00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:20.510
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like there needs to be some</v>

41
00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:23.840
<v Speaker 1>work that has to happen beforehand?</v>

42
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think with athletes,</v>

43
00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:31.171
<v Speaker 2>definitely we see them integrating</v>
<v Speaker 2>mindfulness meditation training into</v>

44
00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:35.300
<v Speaker 2>their coaching right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

45
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.940
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason why we have so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful people who have accomplished</v>

46
00:02:39.941 --> 00:02:42.190
<v Speaker 2>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's burned out along the way and have</v>

47
00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:47.191
<v Speaker 2>not exactly lived very mindfully is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because our culture is drenched in the</v>

48
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.080
<v Speaker 2>delusion that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

49
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.110
<v Speaker 2>the only way to really succeed is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>burn out.</v>

50
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm standing when you go back read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

51
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Edison inventing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inventing the electric bulb and talking</v>

52
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 2>about how sleep is something to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely contemptuous towards,</v>

53
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole Macho idealization of sleep</v>

54
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 2>deprivation and burnout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That very,</v>

55
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 2>very deeply embedded in our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our language.</v>

56
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we congratulate people for working 24</v>

57
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 2>slash seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We congratulate people for being always</v>

58
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we have a lot of work to do to</v>

59
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 2>unravel that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that a lot of people who</v>

60
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 2>have succeeded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have done so despite the father,</v>

61
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 2>the burned out along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because of it and I have included in</v>

62
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:46.231
<v Speaker 2>the book a lot of people who are sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>iconic in our culture,</v>

63
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:51.361
<v Speaker 2>like Steve Jobs saying that he came with</v>
<v Speaker 2>his best ideas that lead to the most</v>

64
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:54.790
<v Speaker 2>iconic apple products after zen</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation.</v>

65
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 2>And he describes it very well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying this was when he could hear more</v>

66
00:03:58.841 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 2>subtle things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

67
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 2>the idea that gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're multitasking,</v>

68
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 2>you are more efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a complete illusion.</v>

69
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 2>And yet so many of us believe that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why you walk down the streets of</v>

70
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:15.541
<v Speaker 2>New York and you see so many people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't walk without being on the phone or</v>

71
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 2>worse walking and texting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was one of these people.</v>

72
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I stopped doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started noticing things that I had</v>

73
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:29.050
<v Speaker 2>completely missed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember going down the street</v>

74
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 2>where I live in her and seeing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful building and telling a friend,</v>

75
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.440
<v Speaker 2>this is such a beautiful building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

76
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.550
<v Speaker 2>when did it go off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said 80 90,</v>

77
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.720
<v Speaker 2>and I wonder what else have I missed.</v>
