1
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's young people have been drawn up in</v>

2
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:21.231
<v Speaker 1>the culture of a enormous wealth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous power,</v>

3
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>enormous opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>the least well off of them is</v>
<v Speaker 1>considerably better than the best of</v>

5
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>their ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they recognize that they see the</v>

6
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:36.501
<v Speaker 1>signs of success as a world defined</v>
<v Speaker 1>success and opulence on every hand.</v>

7
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 1>They are surrounded by sensation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're surrounded by violence.</v>

8
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 1>They are surrounded by a politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of these are capable of delivering</v>

9
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:52.440
<v Speaker 1>the goods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think they recognize that and I</v>

10
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>think there is a desire to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that will last,</v>

11
00:00:56.401 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>something that will do something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will not disappoint and letting you do</v>

12
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>that in very evidently you attempted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn back to the elders,</v>

13
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>to the wisdom of another age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.550
<v Speaker 1>to something that might not seem to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>appeal to you in your earlier phase.</v>

15
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.340
<v Speaker 1>But your earlier phase you recognize was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deceitful and deceptive one.</v>

16
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>You ask Harvard graduates whether all</v>
<v Speaker 1>going and they're all going to go.</v>

17
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Ninety percent of the seniors in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>given class,</v>

18
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>say they're going into three cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to go to Washington just</v>

19
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>to put things right power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to go to New York to make</v>

20
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 1>lots of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

21
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.750
<v Speaker 1>the material world and the going to Los</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angeles to have fun fantasy.</v>

22
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>And I think they've come back from all</v>
<v Speaker 1>three of those cities discovering that</v>

23
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>like ours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no there,</v>

24
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 1>there a Washington is not going to turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world right side up.</v>

25
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the money in New York doesn't spare</v>

26
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The troubles and tribulations of living</v>

27
00:01:55.891 --> 00:02:00.891
<v Speaker 1>in New York and all the fantasy from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lala Latin doesn't dull the pain of</v>

28
00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>living in a life with no meaning and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

29
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's a modest symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people say,</v>

30
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.030
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that must be another way.</v>

31
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Jerusalem is the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.990
<v Speaker 1>maybe a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

33
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>a pilgrimage to the holy city is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

34
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some Ashram somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe sitting under a Bodhi tree who</v>

35
00:02:23.491 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are wiser people than we who</v>

36
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>years ago have discovered some of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>truths.</v>

37
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we even heard them in our youth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe the trick is to try to</v>

38
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>recapture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recover some of that for ourselves.</v>

39
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's part of the excitement.</v>

40
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's against me that young people are</v>

41
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.350
<v Speaker 1>smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think that the,</v>

42
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>they're not prepared to buy a pig in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>poke,</v>

43
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.110
<v Speaker 1>that they are not prepared to put up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

44
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the triumph of the material or</v>

45
00:02:56.821 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>limitations that even the most indulgent</v>
<v Speaker 1>to facebook,</v>

46
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:06.060
<v Speaker 1>a patron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a under 21 is seeking something that's</v>

47
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>of value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something of worth,</v>

48
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>something that will last something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is permanent and even transforming.</v>

49
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 1>And I think that has to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

50
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:16.790
<v Speaker 1>with the fascination with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

51
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a science fiction with a myth and</v>

52
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the Harry Potter thing.</v>

53
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>It's looking for something that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately true and good.</v>

54
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>They are not willing to buy a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rather grim,</v>

55
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>a valueless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>godless,</v>

56
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>spiritualists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a universe which some of the elders are</v>

57
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:43.531
<v Speaker 1>quite prepared to sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that suggests a,</v>

58
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.410
<v Speaker 1>a great hunger desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great spiritual movement,</v>

59
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among the cleverest and most able of</v>

60
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>young people they know better than to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>content with less than a less than the</v>

61
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what they're seeking.</v>
