1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.280
<v Speaker 3>The thing is we have multiple goals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.840
<v Speaker 3>So on the question of stability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy is in really good shape.</v>

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.980
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

6
00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:18.650
<v Speaker 3>I would say that in the 2000 election</v>
<v Speaker 3>cycle,</v>

7
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.570
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that really got</v>

8
00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:25.571
<v Speaker 3>celebrated when George Bush and Al Gore</v>
<v Speaker 3>were running for president,</v>

9
00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:28.850
<v Speaker 3>they get this quirky result.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's fighting it out over the</v>

10
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:32.090
<v Speaker 3>hanging chads in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of all the things that I worry about,</v>

11
00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:33.650
<v Speaker 3>who won the election for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

12
00:00:33.651 --> 00:00:37.460
<v Speaker 3>a couple of months and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that we came out of that process and</v>

13
00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:40.490
<v Speaker 3>we ended up with a precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no military coup,</v>

14
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.270
<v Speaker 3>there was no huge set of demonstrations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for many people,</v>

15
00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:47.630
<v Speaker 3>this constituted a success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a win for democracy,</v>

16
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.530
<v Speaker 3>that we are a country that is so stable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so rule of law,</v>

17
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:54.410
<v Speaker 3>so willing to wait for the process to</v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

18
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.680
<v Speaker 3>Then in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can have stable transitions of</v>

19
00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:01.490
<v Speaker 3>leadership even when things are looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of rough.</v>

20
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.400
<v Speaker 3>So on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one might say,</v>

21
00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:05.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy is great.</v>

22
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're quite stable.</v>

23
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.760
<v Speaker 3>But I think that the story of the 2000</v>
<v Speaker 3>elections could be told another way as</v>

24
00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:12.770
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no military coup.</v>

25
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.660
<v Speaker 3>There was no outright uprising in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>streets.</v>

26
00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:15.411
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

27
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:19.670
<v Speaker 3>all the things that that one might have</v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrated as being about stability,</v>

28
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.760
<v Speaker 3>one might also suggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

29
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.460
<v Speaker 3>reflects a lack of robustness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lack of engagement,</v>

30
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a willingness to defer to authority and</v>

31
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:32.720
<v Speaker 3>to rule of law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if in fact it gives us outcomes</v>

32
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.170
<v Speaker 3>that have terrible consequences for</v>
<v Speaker 3>decades to come.</v>

33
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.740
<v Speaker 3>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it does depend on sort of how</v>

34
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:43.460
<v Speaker 3>one might measure or judge the value or</v>
<v Speaker 3>quality of democracy.</v>

35
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.830
<v Speaker 3>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a great deal of stability,</v>

36
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.740
<v Speaker 3>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a great deal of violence on the part of</v>

37
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.070
<v Speaker 3>ordinary people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of an inability to really penetrate</v>

38
00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:56.690
<v Speaker 3>the elites and to really demonstrate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>discuss what the central issues facing</v>

39
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.670
<v Speaker 3>sort of ordinary Americans are.</v>
