1
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I think the pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>funnily enough of the greatest pleasure</v>

2
00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:13.600
<v Speaker 1>of writing comes from the response you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get from the readers.</v>

3
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Here I am in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walk down the street,</v>

4
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.230
<v Speaker 1>people stop and talk to you and say how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much they love the book and the sort of</v>

5
00:00:20.231 --> 00:00:22.600
<v Speaker 1>praise and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been coming in for the,</v>

6
00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:26.680
<v Speaker 1>for the latest book is very touching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's damned hard work.</v>

7
00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I meant let's get ourselves,</v>

8
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.261
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

9
00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:31.510
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an easy job being a writer,</v>

10
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.660
<v Speaker 1>but once it's finished and you've done</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and it's published and it's in the</v>

11
00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 1>shops and if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes on the best seller's list.</v>

12
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.720
<v Speaker 1>That's very exciting indeed.</v>

13
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't find that a struggle because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>spent a year</v>

14
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.530
<v Speaker 1>before I sit down to write on the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>day and then I go away and have a very</v>

15
00:00:50.531 --> 00:00:53.710
<v Speaker 1>disciplined routine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rise at five in the morning and I</v>

16
00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:58.030
<v Speaker 1>start work at six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work from six until eight from 10</v>

17
00:00:58.031 --> 00:01:02.740
<v Speaker 1>until 12 from two until four from six</v>
<v Speaker 1>until eight.</v>

18
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I've got to bed about nine 30 10 having</v>
<v Speaker 1>a light supper and then I'll get up</v>

19
00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:10.480
<v Speaker 1>again at five the next morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's 50 days of that is the</v>

20
00:01:10.481 --> 00:01:14.350
<v Speaker 1>beginning of what you call the struggle</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that it's tough work.</v>

21
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's probably three or 400 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I take a break and then I will</v>

22
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.300
<v Speaker 1>go back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the last draft of a prisoner of</v>

23
00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:25.360
<v Speaker 1>birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my latest book was probably the 16th or</v>

24
00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 1>17th drops before anybody read it.</v>

25
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Great processors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not</v>

26
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.880
<v Speaker 1>easy to describe because it's a bit like</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a violinist or if you're a</v>

27
00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:41.540
<v Speaker 1>painter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a storyteller.</v>

28
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.200
<v Speaker 1>So this is happening all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mind is buzzing off in different</v>

29
00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:49.160
<v Speaker 1>directions all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't sit down and write a book</v>

30
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.330
<v Speaker 1>until I've had a year of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea and taking it through.</v>

31
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.780
<v Speaker 1>So the idea in a prisoner of birth is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of a young man born in the</v>

32
00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:01.310
<v Speaker 1>east end of London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor part of London,</v>

33
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>who takes his girlfriend to the west end</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ask her to marry him,</v>

34
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.750
<v Speaker 1>and he gets involved in a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with him,</v>

35
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.140
<v Speaker 1>and he's arrested for murder and he then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the trial and he's condemned for</v>

36
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:17.510
<v Speaker 1>murder and sent to a prison from where</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one has escaped.</v>

37
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.980
<v Speaker 1>But he does escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets out and he seeks revenge on the</v>

38
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:24.860
<v Speaker 1>four people who put him there in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>

39
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it clearly as an updating of the</v>

40
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:33.551
<v Speaker 1>count of Monte Cristo and the genius of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dumas's book was the way the prisoner</v>

41
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.610
<v Speaker 1>got out and the way he raised the money</v>
<v Speaker 1>or add the money to gain revenge on the</v>

42
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:43.850
<v Speaker 1>four people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even before I sat down to write,</v>

43
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.230
<v Speaker 1>I made the decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must know how Danny can't rate gets</v>

44
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:51.800
<v Speaker 1>out of prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must know how Danny can't rate gets</v>

45
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:55.160
<v Speaker 1>the money that will make it possible for</v>
<v Speaker 1>him to succeed.</v>

46
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.623
<v Speaker 2>Trust.</v>

47
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>I've had problems where I've got to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>point and I can't see a way out of it,</v>

48
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>but I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never actually sat down and</v>

49
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:09.161
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

50
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were never,</v>

51
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that particular occasion,</v>

52
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:22.320
<v Speaker 1>it arose in a book I wrote called as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crow flies where I had an Australian.</v>

53
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I'd had to have a man flight to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia to solve the mystery of how he</v>

54
00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:30.390
<v Speaker 1>would inherit the fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he got there,</v>

55
00:03:30.391 --> 00:03:34.650
<v Speaker 1>the person who was going to solve it had</v>
<v Speaker 1>died a few weeks before he arrived.</v>

56
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.950
<v Speaker 1>That was suddenly thrown on me when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to bed that night,</v>

57
00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:40.800
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't have the answer when I woke</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next morning.</v>

58
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.970
<v Speaker 1>So I walked around a golf course for</v>
<v Speaker 1>three days on and on and on until</v>

59
00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:48.180
<v Speaker 1>suddenly in a split second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it broke.</v>

60
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.770
<v Speaker 1>And it was so simple as all good ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>are that got me off the hook.</v>
