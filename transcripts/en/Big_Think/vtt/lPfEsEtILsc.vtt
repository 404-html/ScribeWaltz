00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.303
<v Speaker 1>No</v>

2
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.450
<v Speaker 2>latte in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle of Ohio now you know when</v>

3
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:20.241
<v Speaker 2>Seinfeld was on and everybody loved it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what was Jews from New York like</v>

4
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.120
<v Speaker 2>this idea that we're so out of touch and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this culture we've come up with</v>

5
00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:26.980
<v Speaker 2>here is anathema to the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

6
00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Like guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't where we are as well.</v>

7
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Real American as everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sure there are more liberals here,</v>

8
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure Sir.</v>

9
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:44.181
<v Speaker 2>We're used to a more heterogeneous</v>
<v Speaker 2>population in New York City than what I</v>

10
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 2>just saw when I was reporting in Maine</v>
<v Speaker 2>last week,</v>

11
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.550
<v Speaker 2>but there was plenty of Latte and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that different and we're not any</v>

12
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:57.320
<v Speaker 2>less American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well matter of.</v>

13
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Sorry about the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

14
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.940
<v Speaker 2>That that big science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say scientists have realized</v>

15
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.310
<v Speaker 2>that if we keep doing things the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing them,</v>

16
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.420
<v Speaker 2>we are going to end the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

17
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean I wish it weren't so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't make it</v>

18
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.680
<v Speaker 2>a liberal phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I used to just beyond my</v>

19
00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:28.690
<v Speaker 2>comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing I was going to say about the</v>

20
00:01:28.691 --> 00:01:33.691
<v Speaker 2>New York Times is you'll notice that as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much as the president likes to say it's</v>

21
00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:37.390
<v Speaker 2>fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the minute he goes in meets with their</v>

22
00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:39.850
<v Speaker 2>editors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says it's a great American treasure,</v>

23
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is the paper of record and now</v>

24
00:01:42.971 --> 00:01:45.970
<v Speaker 2>and in fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did make some mistakes.</v>

25
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 2>They're humans like all that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the wmds and the and the windup</v>

26
00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:55.060
<v Speaker 2>theory I rapport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is serious stuff that happened that</v>

27
00:01:55.061 --> 00:01:59.170
<v Speaker 2>the times got wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that eroded public trust,</v>

28
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 2>but I don't actually think that's what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

29
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's what this election</v>
<v Speaker 2>was about.</v>

30
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know for fact that it wasn't.</v>

31
00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:13.021
<v Speaker 2>We know for a fact that there was a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>targeted system for disseminating fake</v>

32
00:02:13.571 --> 00:02:14.404
<v Speaker 2>news.</v>

33
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Long form journalism is the only thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever done.</v>

34
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That end writing books,</v>

35
00:02:21.251 --> 00:02:23.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to be a newspaper</v>

36
00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:25.510
<v Speaker 2>journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what they do is incredibly</v>

37
00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:27.820
<v Speaker 2>impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not trained to do it.</v>

38
00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have a different mandate than</v>

39
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:32.471
<v Speaker 2>we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

40
00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:37.280
<v Speaker 2>their mandate is to attempt objectivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

41
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.220
<v Speaker 2>and ours isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we are meant to tell the truth</v>

42
00:02:42.221 --> 00:02:46.930
<v Speaker 2>and everything you read in the New</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yorker has been fact checked more than</v>

43
00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:51.931
<v Speaker 2>you can believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the overall story I'm telling in any</v>

44
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.910
<v Speaker 2>given,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what it is,</v>

45
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.200
<v Speaker 2>it's always my version and it's not my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mandate to be,</v>

46
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 2>to be without a perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not my mandate to,</v>

47
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 2>to remove myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have the least,</v>

48
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>present authorial voice.</v>

49
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not my mandate.</v>

50
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 2>My mandate is to try to make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting for the reader while</v>

51
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.150
<v Speaker 2>informing the reader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

52
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

53
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a complete allegiance to accuracy.</v>

54
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 2>But I'm allowed to tell the story</v>
<v Speaker 2>however I want to.</v>

55
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.680
<v Speaker 2>And that's the luxury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

56
00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 2>that's being a long form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's being a magazine journalist and</v>

57
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 2>that's what I love about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never,</v>

58
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:42.631
<v Speaker 2>I'm never endeavoring to make myself or</v>
<v Speaker 2>my point of view invisible.</v>

59
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 2>That's not my mandate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to be subtle about it because</v>

60
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

61
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 2>the quieter and sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

62
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Speaker 2>the more the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm sly about it,</v>

63
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 2>that it's more persuasive because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to feel that someone's</v>

64
00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 2>directed you to think this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and the other.</v>

65
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 2>You want to feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think that,</v>

66
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's my job to lead you to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is I want you to.</v>

67
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.921
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just there's,</v>

68
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends,</v>

69
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 2>depends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depends how honest the individual</v>

70
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:19.411
<v Speaker 2>journalist is</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how much and how much allegiance he</v>

71
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 2>or she has to the truth to accuracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:28.561
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not wed to making every person feel</v>

73
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 2>that their perspective has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>represented.</v>

74
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm representing my perspective when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell a story,</v>

75
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:40.951
<v Speaker 2>but every single detail in that story</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be the truth and no little false</v>

76
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 2>hood is okay ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we take that very seriously.</v>
