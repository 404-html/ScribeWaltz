1
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually am the founder of the founder</v>

2
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:12.800
<v Speaker 1>is a guy named Steve Hindi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.820
<v Speaker 1>who founded it with his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:16.260
<v Speaker 1>his neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Potter.</v>

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>And Steve had been a reporter in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle East.</v>

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.551
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:24.140
<v Speaker 1>he knew all the major players over there</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Yasser Arafat too,</v>

8
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.243
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the people that,</v>

10
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.100
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really were the main people on the</v>

11
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>stage back in the seventies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>

12
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>And when he worked over in the Middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>East,</v>

13
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:37.140
<v Speaker 1>they often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the journalists would make their own</v>

14
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:40.260
<v Speaker 1>beer when they were in station places</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't allow alcohol.</v>

15
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>So through that he fell in love with</v>
<v Speaker 1>brewing,</v>

16
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.840
<v Speaker 1>came back to the United States and was</v>
<v Speaker 1>brewing with his neighbor who was a</v>

17
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>banker and it was a commercial bank loan</v>
<v Speaker 1>officer and they got together and</v>

18
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>started Brooklyn brewery in 1988.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

19
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.680
<v Speaker 1>I came on in 1994 to build the new</v>
<v Speaker 1>brewery in Brooklyn and to expand from</v>

20
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:06.471
<v Speaker 1>the tube or beers that they had back</v>
<v Speaker 1>then to the 15 or 16 and a year that we</v>

21
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>create right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I've been with the brewery for 14 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

24
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all kind of like,</v>

25
00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:19.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

26
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Speaker 1>my children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:21.191
<v Speaker 1>you guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

28
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is your favorite child.</v>

29
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now some days you might actually have an</v>

30
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 1>answer for that question and that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be true,</v>

31
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 1>I think of the beers as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you asked me in the middle of</v>

32
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Speaker 1>winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get a completely</v>

33
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>different answer than you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get on a hot day in summer.</v>

34
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>If you asked me on a boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get a different answer than you</v>

35
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:39.690
<v Speaker 1>get in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really depends on what I'm having for</v>

36
00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:40.524
<v Speaker 1>dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

37
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of the beers as all having their</v>

38
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:47.360
<v Speaker 1>particular talents and it's just about</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what mood I man at any particular</v>

39
00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:52.361
<v Speaker 1>time</v>
<v Speaker 1>voted to me more likely we fear or a</v>

40
00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Pilsner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm probably going to be having a</v>

41
00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:59.440
<v Speaker 1>number of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anything,</v>

42
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.470
<v Speaker 1>two heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

44
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.161
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:03.710
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

46
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.800
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the sharp,</v>

47
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>bitter flavor of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 1>of the pills and there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm probably gonna lean in that</v>

49
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:13.881
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:18.440
<v Speaker 1>it depends on before or after dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before dinner or with dinner.</v>

51
00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:21.470
<v Speaker 1>It's Brown Ale was after dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's going to be our black</v>

52
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:22.304
<v Speaker 1>chocolates out.</v>

53
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.830
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

54
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.170
<v Speaker 1>In my case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a rooftop in Brooklyn.</v>

55
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

56
00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:33.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do have 800,</v>

57
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:36.970
<v Speaker 1>a big 800 square foot roof and a these</v>
<v Speaker 1>days it's totally been our,</v>

58
00:02:36.971 --> 00:02:38.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn local one,</v>

59
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.590
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.311
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:42.470
<v Speaker 1>the one that we're doing the bottle re</v>
<v Speaker 1>fermentation on,</v>

62
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 9%.</v>

63
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:46.250
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be careful about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stairs as you go back down from the</v>

64
00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:47.210
<v Speaker 1>roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

65
00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:47.911
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:49.630
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been having a very good time with</v>

67
00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.973
<v Speaker 1>in the last year</v>

69
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Brooklyn lager because that's probably</v>

70
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.121
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least for us,</v>

72
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:02.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

73
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>that's our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's our flagship.</v>

74
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's our flagship beer.</v>

75
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 1>It's the beer that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're probably best known for.</v>

76
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>And a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thankfully,</v>

77
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>almost anywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially downtown in New York City,</v>

78
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see a Brooklyn lager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

79
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.991
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still love it.</v>

82
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

83
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.600
<v Speaker 2>it's a great beer.</v>
