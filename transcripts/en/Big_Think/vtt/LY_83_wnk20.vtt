00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.720
<v Speaker 1>So when you're considering known</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary or altered states,</v>

2
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.620
<v Speaker 1>one of the first questions is what do</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel like what's actually going on</v>

3
00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:15.940
<v Speaker 1>in those places and spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the challenges in coming up</v>

4
00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:19.990
<v Speaker 1>with a good and consistent answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just for a specific state like</v>

5
00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:22.930
<v Speaker 1>meditation or a flow state or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic state,</v>

6
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.620
<v Speaker 1>is how do they all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what qualities do they all share?</v>

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Because each of those communities of</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice over central decades,</v>

8
00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:34.900
<v Speaker 1>centuries and even millennia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have accumulated their own storytelling</v>

9
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>or content about what the state and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>access are or what they mean and where</v>

10
00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:42.550
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to go through them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for instance,</v>

11
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>if you were a Buddhist meditator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be instructed in all sorts of</v>

12
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.360
<v Speaker 1>stages and levels and progressions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>non ordinary states of consciousness</v>

13
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 1>ranging from waking state all the way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>white light,</v>

14
00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:56.890
<v Speaker 1>voice to Buddha consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

15
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 1>If I am a peasant farmer in India and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a non ordinary state experience,</v>

16
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.420
<v Speaker 1>I might experience ganash right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the elephant god in a rice patty.</v>

17
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.630
<v Speaker 1>If I'm a peasant in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might experience the virgin of</v>

18
00:01:10.631 --> 00:01:12.160
<v Speaker 1>guadalupe hidalgo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:16.930
<v Speaker 1>If I'm a coder in silicon valley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might experience the matrix and code</v>

20
00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:19.090
<v Speaker 1>mode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is ones and zeros streaming all</v>

21
00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:24.091
<v Speaker 1>night is I bang away on my keyboard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality is is that underneath those</v>

22
00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 1>experiences are far more alike than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrapping paper.</v>

23
00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 1>The narratIve wrapping paper of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>people see based on culture accustom</v>

24
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.740
<v Speaker 1>biography and what we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we attempted to do was create a</v>

25
00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:40.150
<v Speaker 1>functIonal framework that lets us talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about these things as apples to apples</v>

26
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.470
<v Speaker 1>and really see the similarities and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we realized is that because of the</v>

27
00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:48.370
<v Speaker 1>neurobiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are four qualities that tend to</v>

28
00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:53.371
<v Speaker 1>arise pretty consistently regardless of</v>
<v Speaker 1>which door you go through to get into</v>

29
00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:57.400
<v Speaker 1>these northern states and they a</v>
<v Speaker 1>selflessness,</v>

30
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.650
<v Speaker 1>timelessness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>effortlessness,</v>

31
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 1>and richness or stir for short and</v>
<v Speaker 1>selflessness tends to happen because the</v>

32
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.770
<v Speaker 1>areas of our brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically the prefrontal cortex,</v>

33
00:02:08.771 --> 00:02:13.771
<v Speaker 1>but including additional networks that</v>
<v Speaker 1>connect often turn off or completely</v>

34
00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:15.400
<v Speaker 1>light up.</v>

35
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knock out our everyday waking sense</v>

36
00:02:19.511 --> 00:02:21.370
<v Speaker 1>of self consciousness and self</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness.</v>

37
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.510
<v Speaker 1>So we ended up momentarily lost our</v>
<v Speaker 1>inner voice,</v>

38
00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:27.400
<v Speaker 1>lost our inner critic last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our jimminy cricket,</v>

39
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.730
<v Speaker 1>and we are in a state of not thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about our thinking.</v>

40
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Timelessness happens for a similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason as as basically different parts</v>

41
00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:42.160
<v Speaker 1>of our brain light up and turn off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our ability to calculate time gets</v>

42
00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:45.790
<v Speaker 1>knocked out because it is a is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive measurement.</v>

43
00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:47.770
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't just occur in one single</v>

44
00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:51.100
<v Speaker 1>location in our brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we start knocking out parts of</v>

45
00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:55.840
<v Speaker 1>the networks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lose our chronometer and all of the</v>

46
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.370
<v Speaker 1>neurochemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

47
00:02:57.371 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Focusing attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning drives our attention.</v>

48
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>We dropped out of daydreaming about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past or the future and we get absolutely</v>

49
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 1>sucked into the immediate present</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

50
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>So a feeling of timelessness comes with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

51
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>The effortlessness is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no longer about what I'm trying to</v>

52
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

53
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not about exerting grit or will</v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

54
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>which has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have been talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>and writing about these days and it's</v>

56
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 1>literally in the sort of almost in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biblical sense,</v>

57
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 1>sort of not my wIll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but thy will.</v>

58
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I feel myself swept along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can be I'm just self propelled</v>

59
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 1>and it feels awesome or it's terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have a choice,</v>

60
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 1>but either way it's not me plotting one</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot in front of the other to get to a</v>

61
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've decided so that's the</v>

62
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>effortlessness and then the final bit is</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich is the richness and that's arguably</v>

63
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:47.430
<v Speaker 1>the whole shooting match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when I knock out my self</v>

64
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a voice inside my head,</v>

65
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 1>second guessing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filtering when I'm not in the past or</v>

66
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:55.030
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just in the deep present.</v>

67
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.910
<v Speaker 1>When I am effortlessly being propelled.</v>

68
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.120
<v Speaker 1>The next thing that consistently seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen is we have access to far more</v>

69
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:08.371
<v Speaker 1>information than we do in our regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>waking state and that is when we go from</v>

70
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:12.130
<v Speaker 1>conscious processinG,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very limited and narrow to</v>

71
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>unconscious processing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is faster and vaster.</v>

72
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.350
<v Speaker 1>And Dr. David eagleman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's at stanford,</v>

73
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 1>who's a friend and a colleague and a and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a board member of ours at the flow</v>

74
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:26.630
<v Speaker 1>genome project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will constantly makes that case that</v>

75
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 1>that really it's as if our conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind is sort of like the headlines of</v>

76
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:36.211
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow's newspaper reporting on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality of today and when we get into</v>

77
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 1>non ordinary states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the all of the shifts and</v>

78
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 1>brain function and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hormones and neuro electricity,</v>

79
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 1>we have access to more of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>information in real time.</v>

80
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.700
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the results often feels</v>

81
00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:53.530
<v Speaker 1>supernatural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People in the past historically have</v>

82
00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:55.590
<v Speaker 1>assigned this to the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the muses,</v>

83
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 1>to fate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to possession,</v>

84
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 1>to angels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You name it,</v>

85
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've preTty much exhausted the</v>

86
00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 1>gamut of all the ways we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just too much.</v>

87
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 1>This is too cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do inspired.</v>

88
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:08.800
<v Speaker 1>It's too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too informed to possibly be me.</v>

89
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.980
<v Speaker 1>So we've assigned it supernatural</v>
<v Speaker 1>origins,</v>

90
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 1>but in reality we now know it might just</v>
<v Speaker 1>be super hyphen natural.</v>

91
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 1>It's just us in an automated state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

92
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.330
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's biG data for our minds.</v>
