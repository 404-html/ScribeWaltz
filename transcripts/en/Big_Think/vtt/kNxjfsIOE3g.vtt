<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I've got the perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a painting by Pizarro and Pizarro</v>

3
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 1>lived in south London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>near Crystal Palace.</v>

4
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a very high point in lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of impressionist slip there.</v>

5
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.470
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.290
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a movement in the name of which have</v>

7
00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>just forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.560
<v Speaker 1>and Pizarro painted a picture of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pendulous station.</v>

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm paige.</v>

10
00:00:51.191 --> 00:00:56.191
<v Speaker 1>Where station was the station that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to every day when I went to work as</v>

11
00:00:57.701 --> 00:01:02.701
<v Speaker 1>a 15 year old apprentice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was my ambition when I grew up to</v>

12
00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:08.230
<v Speaker 1>become a famous artist and buy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>painting,</v>

13
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 1>which are course never can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But since you've asked me a hypothetical</v>

14
00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
