00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Definitely do not get sucked into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindset that these things are inherently</v>

2
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:08.340
<v Speaker 1>top heavy or front end costly or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

3
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was possible to do it much more</v>

4
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>efficiently than a lot of people told us</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the case.</v>

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.840
<v Speaker 1>When we surveyed the landscape of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>was out there in this particular sector,</v>

6
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>even of it stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we dug around a little to sort of</v>

7
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:28.740
<v Speaker 1>investigate what kind of costs labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what goes into this.</v>

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.160
<v Speaker 1>We were pretty stunned to find out what</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were spending on the front end to</v>

9
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>engineer these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them up.</v>

10
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>We had a really hard time figuring out</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people were spending all that money</v>

11
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>on to create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think very bad products.</v>

12
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.870
<v Speaker 1>What is possible for a young person with</v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea in terms of executing it today</v>

13
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>even more than five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly more than 10 years ago in</v>

14
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>terms of the speed with which you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineer things,</v>

15
00:00:56.731 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>the software that's available in an open</v>
<v Speaker 1>source way for you to construct these</v>

16
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suffice to say,</v>

17
00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:07.191
<v Speaker 1>I think if people knew what it took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it costs us to set crowdrise up,</v>

18
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>they'd be staggered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like fractional compared to</v>

19
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>some of the other big name things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've heard about.</v>
