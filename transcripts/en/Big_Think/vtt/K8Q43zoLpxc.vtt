1
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.240
<v Speaker 1>I smiled because I'm probably the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>one running for president who took an</v>

2
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>issue to the democratic platform</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally and ask them to act on it.</v>

3
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>And let me tell you what the issue was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Healthcare in 2000</v>

4
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I took this proposal for a not for</v>
<v Speaker 1>profit healthcare system,</v>

5
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>medicare for ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Democratic Platform Committee.</v>

6
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>I was asked by the campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the presidential candidate to withdraw</v>

7
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:41.280
<v Speaker 1>the proposal because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not favored by the insurance</v>

8
00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>interest who were contributing mightily</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Democratic Party.</v>

9
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and virtually the same thing happened in</v>

10
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>2004 so here's the Democratic Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These candidates are saying universal</v>

11
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:53.280
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's some kind of mantra,</v>

12
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.030
<v Speaker 1>universal healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>universal healthcare.</v>

13
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>And then people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

14
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>they're for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to give me a universal</v>

15
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:03.930
<v Speaker 1>healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The insurance companies want universal</v>

16
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 1>healthcare as long as the government is</v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidizing them so they can maintain</v>

17
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're holding their privilege profit</v>

18
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about no more healthcare for</v>

19
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows these insurance companies</v>

20
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Speaker 1>make money not providing health care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows it.</v>

21
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>So I'm saying no more for profit</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>

22
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>not for profit system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the money goes into care for people.</v>

23
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>And then you have enough money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only for basic care but for vision</v>

24
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dental care,</v>

25
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>mental health care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm care,</v>

26
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>prescription drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all covered 100% under the cassette,</v>

27
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 1>which program the Democrats new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to protect the insurance</v>

28
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:43.554
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

29
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.550
<v Speaker 1>that I accept much of the platform of</v>
<v Speaker 1>either party,</v>

31
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:56.150
<v Speaker 1>but I will tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I work with Republicans in Congress</v>

32
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.550
<v Speaker 1>who stands for protecting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution were absolutely opposed to</v>

33
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:06.551
<v Speaker 1>the Patriot Act who believe that wire</v>
<v Speaker 1>tapping eavesdropping is an undermining</v>

34
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.340
<v Speaker 1>of constitutional protections to be free</v>
<v Speaker 1>from your person for unreasonable search</v>

35
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.310
<v Speaker 1>searches and seizures who believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

37
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.610
<v Speaker 1>that government functions best when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>stays out of people private lives.</v>

38
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.480
<v Speaker 1>So that aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to go more towards,</v>

39
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Republicans think,</v>

40
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.260
<v Speaker 1>the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I support.</v>

41
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.480
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I also think that,</v>

42
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this idea of,</v>

43
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.820
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Democrats and Republicans a good idea</v>

44
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:41.780
<v Speaker 1>as long as there's a real debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when the debate becomes blurred</v>

45
00:02:41.781 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 1>because you have corporate interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>contributing two Democrats and two</v>

46
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have the American people being</v>

47
00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:53.300
<v Speaker 1>deserved than people in those parties</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintained their privileged position.</v>

48
00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economic status of their</v>

49
00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:57.260
<v Speaker 1>constituents begins to erode.</v>
