1
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.790
<v Speaker 1>We lost about seven years by the Bush</v>
<v Speaker 1>administration dropping the partnership</v>

2
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:17.991
<v Speaker 1>for new generation of vehicles that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming along at the end of the Clinton</v>

3
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>administration much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I it under Vice President Gore's</v>

4
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.280
<v Speaker 1>leadership actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.460
<v Speaker 1>and moving to a hydrogen passenger</v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicles,</v>

6
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.970
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has its uses as chemical and chemical</v>

8
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>plants and the like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might even someday be a reasonable</v>

9
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:42.570
<v Speaker 1>fuel for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.350
<v Speaker 1>for putting in fuel cells and vehicles</v>
<v Speaker 1>for something that is centrally fueled,</v>

11
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.550
<v Speaker 1>like say a fleet of school buses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to have a hydrogen distribution</v>

12
00:00:56.251 --> 00:01:01.251
<v Speaker 1>system at neighborhood filling stations</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over the country,</v>

13
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with reforming hydrogen,</v>

14
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:07.760
<v Speaker 1>putting natural gas in each filling</v>
<v Speaker 1>station.</v>

15
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Reformers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>storing explosive hydrogen on a pumping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on and on.</v>

17
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.160
<v Speaker 1>I had approximately said that I thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was going to cost hundreds of</v>

18
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was talking with a former</v>

19
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 1>secretary of energy who's a big fan of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen,</v>

20
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not long ago.</v>

21
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.091
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

22
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not hundreds of billions,</v>

23
00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way over a trillion,</v>

24
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.260
<v Speaker 1>trillion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trillion there before you know it,</v>

25
00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>it adds up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>whereas the only infrastructure change</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to drive a plugin hybrid is an</v>

27
00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>extension cord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's new solar companies,</v>

28
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>then film solar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nano solar,</v>

29
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>solar coming off the collectors coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the production line at a square</v>

30
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.193
<v Speaker 1>meter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a second.</v>

31
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new types of wind turbines.</v>

32
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:57.240
<v Speaker 1>It can be used on individual buildings</v>
<v Speaker 1>and houses,</v>

33
00:01:57.241 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily propeller like spinning</v>
<v Speaker 1>turbans,</v>

34
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:01.740
<v Speaker 1>but other designs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vertical designs,</v>

35
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.220
<v Speaker 1>battery improvements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making quite plausible.</v>

37
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>A 40 mile driving on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a plugin on overnight electricity</v>

39
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>before you need any gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can do that in general motors,</v>

40
00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>since that's what they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing in 2010.</v>

41
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's in model year.</v>

42
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>That's just two years and a bit from</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

43
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>If you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

44
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see.</v>

45
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Well over half the cars in the country</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are plugins driving effectively on</v>

46
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>no gasoline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no liquid fuel,</v>

47
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>because the average car goes just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little over 30 miles a day.</v>

48
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>And if you have a 40 mile battery</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ballpark,</v>

49
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.250
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be getting a hundred to</v>
<v Speaker 1>120 miles per gallon of gasoline.</v>

50
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Now if you replaced that gasoline with</v>
<v Speaker 1>85% ethanol,</v>

51
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>and let's say it's cellulosic ethanol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're not going to add more and more</v>

52
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:12.180
<v Speaker 1>to the corn crunch and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.250
<v Speaker 1>then you're getting somewhere up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>range of 500 miles per gallon of</v>

54
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't have to preach at people</v>

55
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 1>about not driving suv is if they have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

56
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Vinny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a plugin hybrid.</v>

57
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>And when it uses liquid fuel is running</v>
<v Speaker 1>on e 85,</v>

58
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're only getting 150 to 200</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles a gallon of gasoline.</v>

59
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>But for a chevy suburban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how bad is that?</v>

60
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people need big cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gotta be able to have them if they</v>

62
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:41.500
<v Speaker 1>need them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

63
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.710
<v Speaker 1>what the problem is not the cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the fuel and people both from the</v>

64
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 1>national security perspective and from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the global warming perspective or</v>

65
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:56.821
<v Speaker 1>zeroing in more and more on oil as a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the problem.</v>

66
00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

68
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's promising.</v>

69
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I it,</v>

70
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.160
<v Speaker 1>it's not something you can say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is here within the next five years,</v>

71
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you will within five years see</v>

72
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:18.691
<v Speaker 1>plugin hybrids on production lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see increases in production of</v>

73
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>alternative liquid fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see most cars coming off the</v>

74
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 1>production lines being flexible fuel</v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicles so they can use ethanol,</v>

75
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.700
<v Speaker 1>ethanol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>renewable,</v>

76
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>butanol,</v>

77
00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some simple things that</v>

78
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 1>government mandates are good for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flexible fuel vehicles is one,</v>

79
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 1>the change you need is simply a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of different type of material in the</v>

80
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>fuel line and some valves and a slight</v>
<v Speaker 1>software reprogramming.</v>

81
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>It costs less than a hundred dollars a</v>
<v Speaker 1>car on the production line.</v>

82
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Speaker 1>It's much less of a big deal than seat</v>
<v Speaker 1>belts.</v>

83
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>

84
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 1>a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think around 2002 or three,</v>

85
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.830
<v Speaker 1>just ordered new vehicles shipped to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them or produced domestically to be</v>

86
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:05.620
<v Speaker 1>flexible fuel vehicles that could use</v>
<v Speaker 1>either ethanol or gasoline in any</v>

87
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:07.360
<v Speaker 1>mixture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

88
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>in two years they went from 5% to 75% of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new cars being flexible fuel</v>

89
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:14.830
<v Speaker 1>vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So something that simple,</v>

90
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any reason not to mandate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is a really bad idea is for the</v>

91
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 1>government to mandate a solution to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuel issue.</v>

92
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.000
<v Speaker 1>It's tried it twice in the last 30 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's massively botched it both</v>

93
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>

94
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:32.970
<v Speaker 1>it tried to come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.813
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.440
<v Speaker 1>in the Carter administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tried to come up with a synthetic</v>

97
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>fuel operation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The syn fuels corporation.</v>

98
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:45.120
<v Speaker 1>It was hugely expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't have been affordable and</v>

99
00:05:45.121 --> 00:05:50.121
<v Speaker 1>less oil and stayed way up close to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well 70 to $100 a barrel.</v>

100
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in 1985,</v>

101
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.110
<v Speaker 1>the Sovi the Saudis drop the bottom out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

102
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>the oil market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think probably in part to cause</v>

103
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 1>trouble for the Soviets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was good because it was the</v>

104
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the end of the Soviet he</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>

105
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 1>But one of the other problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

106
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

107
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 1>created was they bankrupted the synfuels</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>

108
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was understandable.</v>

109
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 1>And then we'd been through all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this nonsense about the hydrogen family</v>

110
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

111
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

112
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>much of the last seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Bush administration,</v>

113
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 1>the government does not have a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>record of picking solutions that ought</v>

114
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 1>to stay out of the business of picking</v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions.</v>

115
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.140
<v Speaker 1>What it ought to do is enable</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

116
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Flexible fuel vehicles enable</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition between other types of</v>

117
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:39.260
<v Speaker 1>liquid fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

118
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.590
<v Speaker 1>battery improvements enable competition</v>
<v Speaker 1>between electricity and liquid fuels.</v>

119
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>As you can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I genuinely think plugins are going to</v>

120
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:55.181
<v Speaker 1>have a huge impact once people realize</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can not only go into a</v>

121
00:06:56.721 --> 00:07:01.721
<v Speaker 1>showroom and buy a reasonably priced car</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can plug into their garage</v>

122
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:06.971
<v Speaker 1>socket drive for much of the day on</v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively penny a mile electricity</v>

123
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:11.930
<v Speaker 1>because off peak overnight power is</v>
<v Speaker 1>bound a nickel,</v>

124
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:14.960
<v Speaker 1>a kilowatt hour and much of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five kilowatt hour charge.</v>

125
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.390
<v Speaker 1>So say it's something between one and 2</v>
<v Speaker 1>cents a mile.</v>

126
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gasoline now is 10,</v>

127
00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 cents a mile.</v>

128
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 1>So you're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something close to one 10th the</v>

129
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:29.690
<v Speaker 1>cost that you're usually driving that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes a big difference in some</v>

130
00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:30.610
<v Speaker 1>people's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

131
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>budgets.</v>

132
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.480
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing is that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>concept called V two g or vehicle to</v>

133
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:42.500
<v Speaker 1>grid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which after you charged your plugin</v>

134
00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:44.690
<v Speaker 1>hybrid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you get a charge by midnight</v>

135
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 1>and I have a timer on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make it available to the utility</v>

136
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 1>from midnight to 6:00 AM when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you leave for work,</v>

137
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:57.230
<v Speaker 1>for stabilization of the grid and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's called spinning reserves.</v>

138
00:07:57.231 --> 00:08:02.231
<v Speaker 1>That is a power outages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those two together are only about 5% of</v>

139
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:08.051
<v Speaker 1>what utilities need to buy about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Been about $12 billion a year worth of</v>

140
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 1>fossil fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly natural gas because natural gas</v>

141
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 1>tends to be what is turned on and off</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly since it's amenable to that.</v>

142
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.700
<v Speaker 1>that amount of money if it's divided up</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly between the utilities and the,</v>

144
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:25.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

145
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.130
<v Speaker 1>the consumers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

146
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

147
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 1>a professor at the University of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delaware Kimpton who is writing articles</v>

149
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:38.180
<v Speaker 1>about this and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:44.110
<v Speaker 1>you realize that could be something up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the range of $2,000 a year for the</v>

151
00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:48.350
<v Speaker 1>owner of a plugin hybrid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's think about this a minute.</v>

152
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Not only am I driving it a 10th the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cost,</v>

153
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.100
<v Speaker 1>but somebody is paying me close to $200</v>
<v Speaker 1>a month.</v>

154
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Heck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a major share of my car payment</v>

155
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.520
<v Speaker 1>just to leave my car plugged in</v>
<v Speaker 1>overnight.</v>

156
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's that dealer's showroom?</v>

157
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

158
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think once and different than</v>

159
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 1>utilities or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or interested in this and to different</v>

160
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 1>degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in California,</v>

161
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.160
<v Speaker 1>if you'd talked to pg and e for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are really enthusiastic about this,</v>

162
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concept.</v>

163
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:23.510
<v Speaker 1>So there could be a substantial interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of people,</v>

164
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

165
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:27.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in moving toward plugin hybrids when sir</v>

166
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:30.630
<v Speaker 1>available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no doubt Toyota has led the way</v>

167
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:34.470
<v Speaker 1>with the Prius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but General Motors did a very important</v>

168
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:39.471
<v Speaker 1>thing back in early January when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>announced to the production of the volt,</v>

169
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:45.150
<v Speaker 1>their plugin hybrid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a few weeks ago on National</v>

170
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Public Radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Bob Lutz,</v>

171
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Speaker 1>a very senior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's vice chairman of the board and I'm</v>

172
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.550
<v Speaker 1>a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much identified with large cars and</v>

173
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:55.350
<v Speaker 1>fast cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

174
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.400
<v Speaker 1>he announced they're going to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>production on plugin hybrids in 2010.</v>

175
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.990
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

176
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have thought to from what he was</v>

177
00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:06.450
<v Speaker 1>saying about oil that he was president</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Sierra Club.</v>

178
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just from my point of view.</v>

179
00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:10.170
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

180
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:15.230
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting is that Toyota got it</v>
<v Speaker 1>early and I think gm has gotten it now,</v>

181
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:23.090
<v Speaker 1>which is that for Americans they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they shouldn't have any particular</v>

182
00:10:24.121 --> 00:10:27.150
<v Speaker 1>problem with the cars.</v>

183
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:28.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

184
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:33.140
<v Speaker 1>I had three little boys at a stage in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life where I was driving eight,</v>

185
00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:38.010
<v Speaker 1>nine kids around to soccer practice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy scouts and so forth.</v>

186
00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:42.480
<v Speaker 1>I needed my chevy suburban people ought</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to have the cars they want.</v>

187
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:44.520
<v Speaker 1>The problem's not the cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the fuel.</v>

188
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:50.510
<v Speaker 1>And so as long as what you're doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to persuade Detroit to increase</v>

189
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:55.920
<v Speaker 1>the cafe standards a mile or two or</v>
<v Speaker 1>three or four or five or whatever per</v>

190
00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:59.010
<v Speaker 1>gallon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're tying to do is ring more</v>

191
00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:03.090
<v Speaker 1>mileage by redesigning the car sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and relatively cheap,</v>

192
00:11:03.091 --> 00:11:06.720
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in a little bit more expensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to wring that out.</v>

193
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.250
<v Speaker 1>But if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

194
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.700
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they lobby against it,</v>

195
00:11:11.701 --> 00:11:15.990
<v Speaker 1>and they probably could have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordered to do it much faster than</v>

196
00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:18.480
<v Speaker 1>they've done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from their point of view,</v>

197
00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:20.310
<v Speaker 1>consumers wanted big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast cars.</v>

198
00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:22.060
<v Speaker 1>So all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had a huge amount of improvement</v>

199
00:11:22.061 --> 00:11:24.360
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in technology and vehicles in the last</v>

200
00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:28.170
<v Speaker 1>20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Virtually all of it has gone in to speed</v>

201
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:29.670
<v Speaker 1>and horsepower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not into,</v>

202
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.410
<v Speaker 1>into fuel efficiency.</v>
