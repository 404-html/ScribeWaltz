00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.140
<v Speaker 1>You've got to accept that not everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to care about every thing</v>

2
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.150
<v Speaker 1>equally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're sort of different categories</v>

3
00:00:11.151 --> 00:00:15.890
<v Speaker 1>of people always in and around a given</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause or given effort.</v>

4
00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:19.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are people who care</v>
<v Speaker 1>passionately about it who have a direct</v>

5
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:24.491
<v Speaker 1>personal connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we wanted to be sure to do was make</v>

6
00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:29.270
<v Speaker 1>sure that for the motivated person who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a target and a goal,</v>

7
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>that that what we were engineering was</v>
<v Speaker 1>an incredible toolbox for them to use</v>

8
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:41.081
<v Speaker 1>all of our best ideas that we've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>had and even to source from other people</v>

9
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.470
<v Speaker 1>by surfing around in the site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective ways of taking their</v>

10
00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:47.990
<v Speaker 1>motivation and their energy and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

11
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.200
<v Speaker 1>leveraging it into really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity in terms of their personal</v>

12
00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:56.000
<v Speaker 1>fundraising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on the one hand you want to supply</v>

13
00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:00.380
<v Speaker 1>the motivated person with everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to do a really good job.</v>

14
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.940
<v Speaker 1>The next ring out is people who might</v>
<v Speaker 1>not have a specific connection.</v>

15
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.970
<v Speaker 1>And if the motivated person who cares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's reaching out to their own circles</v>

16
00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:13.430
<v Speaker 1>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take people who are already donors to</v>

17
00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:18.290
<v Speaker 1>you and turn them into small fundraisers</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

18
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.951
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

19
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:21.920
<v Speaker 1>if a person is capable of giving 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks themselves,</v>

20
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's really easy for them to reach</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to their family and friends and just</v>

21
00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:28.250
<v Speaker 1>on the strength of personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>

22
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.570
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could I get,</v>

23
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.460
<v Speaker 1>10 more people to donate 50 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they've just multiplied their own</v>

25
00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 1>capacity by 10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who was involved in fundraising</v>

26
00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:44.420
<v Speaker 1>will tell you that that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplying effect has huge</v>

27
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.860
<v Speaker 1>ramifications.</v>
