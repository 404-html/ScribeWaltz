1
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me start with why I got interested</v>

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:06.290
<v Speaker 1>in writing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I was directing a bioethics center in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia and we were contacted by</v>

4
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:15.861
<v Speaker 1>doctors who had ethical dilemmas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were working in a neonatal</v>

5
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:20.070
<v Speaker 1>intensive care units,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensive care units for very small</v>

6
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they had,</v>

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>

8
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.730
<v Speaker 1>which for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a spinal Bifida in which in their view</v>

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>it was not really a good thing for these</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies to survive.</v>

10
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the babies if they did survive would</v>

11
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 1>need multiple operations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>would be severely disabled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.070
<v Speaker 1>in various wise and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often the parents also thought that</v>

14
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.670
<v Speaker 1>given the description of the condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not going to be a good thing for</v>

15
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>the babies to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these babies were essentially being</v>

16
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.050
<v Speaker 1>not treated and the result of being not</v>
<v Speaker 1>treated was that by mostly died before</v>

17
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>they were six months old.</v>

18
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of them died before they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>six months old.</v>

19
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Some of them died in the first week or</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

20
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>some of the first month or two and</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

21
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Gradually throughout that first six</v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

22
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.630
<v Speaker 1>And this was a very draining experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the parents,</v>

23
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:16.920
<v Speaker 1>the doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nurses.</v>

24
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>You had these small babies in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital,</v>

25
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>but not being treated in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>to make them live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

27
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 1>but nevertheless living for quite a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

28
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>And the doctor said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>how are we doing the right thing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this justifiable?</v>

30
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.820
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my colleague,</v>

31
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Helga cruiser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I looked at it and we decided that</v>

32
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a reasonable decision for the</v>

33
00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>parents and doctors to make that it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than infants with this condition</v>

34
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.790
<v Speaker 1>should not live based with the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>severe variants of this condition should</v>

35
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>not live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we couldn't defend the idea that the</v>

36
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:58.260
<v Speaker 1>right thing to do then was to let them</v>
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

37
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this same slow and painful and as I</v>

38
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 1>terribly emotionally draining on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents and others.</v>

40
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>So we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

41
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 1>the difficult decision is whether you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want this infant to live or not.</v>

42
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should be a decision for the</v>

43
00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>parents and doctors to make on the basis</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fullest possible information</v>

44
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>about what the condition is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you've made that decision,</v>

45
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.250
<v Speaker 1>it should be permissible to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that baby dies swiftly and humanely.</v>

46
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's the decision.</v>

47
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>If your decision is that it's better</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the child should not live,</v>

48
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.630
<v Speaker 1>it should be possible to ensure that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>child dies swiftly and you mainly.</v>

49
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's what we,</v>

50
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>that's what we proposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

51
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 1>that's been picked up by a variety of</v>
<v Speaker 1>opponents,</v>

52
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:51.690
<v Speaker 1>both pro life movement people and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>people in the militant disability</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>

54
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which incidentally didn't really exist</v>

55
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>at the time.</v>

56
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>We wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>we first write about this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.370
<v Speaker 1>and they've taken us as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>the stalking horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bogey man if you like.</v>

60
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.570
<v Speaker 1>because we're up at front in saying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think this is how we should treat</v>

62
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:14.550
<v Speaker 1>these infants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

63
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>I can understand to some extent why the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro life movement takes us that way,</v>

64
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>but I think the disability movement or</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be just as upset about letting</v>

65
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 1>children die because they have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>disability.</v>

66
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>And since that's a very common practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many hospitals,</v>

67
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so sure why they've gone after</v>
<v Speaker 1>us in particular,</v>

68
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>rather than after the doctors who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually doing it.</v>

69
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I really don't see the</v>

70
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:43.261
<v Speaker 1>difference between letting the children</v>
<v Speaker 1>die and making sure that their death</v>

71
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>comes swiftly and humanely.</v>
