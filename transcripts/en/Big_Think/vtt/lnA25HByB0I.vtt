1
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.830
<v Speaker 1>This same sky trend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technologies for linear synchronis</v>

2
00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:18.310
<v Speaker 1>motors and the maglev,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:18.311 --> 00:00:22.120
<v Speaker 1>are being applied to a wind</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies.</v>

4
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.100
<v Speaker 1>What we're doing with our partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one cycle control and power conversion.</v>

5
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.550
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple aspects of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are number one,</v>

6
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>we're building a unit here in Irvine to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go up in palm springs to replace a 1980s</v>

7
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 58 foot diameter,</v>

8
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.990
<v Speaker 1>windmill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>65 kilowatts.</v>

9
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.760
<v Speaker 1>This should be going up in a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks and we'll have to test it for a</v>

10
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.640
<v Speaker 1>couple months and then there's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be several hundred if they liked the</v>

11
00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:53.740
<v Speaker 1>data they see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

12
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 1>we do all this math and physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now you've got to build stuff and</v>

13
00:00:56.591 --> 00:00:58.060
<v Speaker 1>prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we're doing.</v>

14
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.900
<v Speaker 1>So this technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will eliminate the gearboxes where</v>

15
00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:08.500
<v Speaker 1>you have a direct drive system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>40% of the lifetime costs of windmills</v>

16
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.790
<v Speaker 1>is the gearboxes they wear out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same reason on skytrain,</v>

17
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.550
<v Speaker 1>you don't want gearboxes and tires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things wear out.</v>

18
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.610
<v Speaker 1>The other aspect is the power</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversion.</v>

19
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.500
<v Speaker 1>We can take low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low speeds and high high speeds and</v>

20
00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:26.860
<v Speaker 1>supply to the utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Southern California Edison.</v>

21
00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:30.880
<v Speaker 1>In this instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>proper frequency electric and was,</v>

22
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 1>if all your s frequency is 60 cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they can accept between 50 and 70</v>

23
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.760
<v Speaker 1>while if they're great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest mean,</v>

24
00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:42.760
<v Speaker 1>pulled down to say 59.3 cycles a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

25
00:01:42.761 --> 00:01:47.761
<v Speaker 1>We're going to deliver 59.3 and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one cycle control power technology.</v>

26
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.690
<v Speaker 1>What this enables is we can gather</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy at very low speeds and higher</v>

27
00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:57.130
<v Speaker 1>speeds up to the limitations where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a good structural safety factor on</v>

28
00:01:57.131 --> 00:02:02.131
<v Speaker 1>the props.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We sidebuy sea side the geared type</v>

29
00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:04.660
<v Speaker 1>system compared to our system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a year,</v>

30
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:07.660
<v Speaker 1>we should be able to sell about double</v>
<v Speaker 1>the energy to southern California</v>

31
00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Anderson on the same wind profile on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same hill.</v>

32
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.200
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be pretty hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting a lot of interest in</v>

33
00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:19.201
<v Speaker 1>financial interest in this technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it really actually gets better when</v>

34
00:02:19.211 --> 00:02:24.211
<v Speaker 1>we started talking three or five</v>
<v Speaker 1>megawatt wind mills,</v>

35
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:27.220
<v Speaker 1>the big ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's even 10 megawatt wind mills</v>

36
00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:27.940
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.020
<v Speaker 1>being designed not to.</v>

38
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
