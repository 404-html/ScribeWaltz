00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.690
<v Speaker 1>The idea of why being moody could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you,</v>

2
00:00:02.691 --> 00:00:06.620
<v Speaker 1>really has to do with taking advantage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of one of the biggest strengths and</v>

3
00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:11.210
<v Speaker 1>assets that women have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is intuition and knowing that</v>

4
00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.430
<v Speaker 1>something is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling that something is wrong and then</v>

5
00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:16.250
<v Speaker 1>optimally speaking up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing to keep in mind,</v>

6
00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:18.950
<v Speaker 1>I think that's very important is that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mood disorder,</v>

7
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.440
<v Speaker 1>which is a sort of a psychiatric</v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis.</v>

8
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.490
<v Speaker 1>It's not what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm talking about is an emotion</v>

9
00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:30.491
<v Speaker 1>that comes over you and last maybe 15 to</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 seconds and then if you really feel</v>

10
00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:32.990
<v Speaker 1>it and allow it to pass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will,</v>

11
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moods can change minute to minute.</v>

12
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.470
<v Speaker 1>And someone who is moody exhibits a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of different moods.</v>

13
00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:42.410
<v Speaker 1>And what we're talking about really is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the expression of emotion,</v>

14
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.710
<v Speaker 1>feeling and emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting with it,</v>

15
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.410
<v Speaker 1>really understanding it and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>conveying it to somebody else.</v>

16
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.480
<v Speaker 1>This is how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

17
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.690
<v Speaker 1>say in the days leading up to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>period where you may feel that you're</v>

18
00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:57.200
<v Speaker 1>more sensitive to your environment or</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have a thinner skin or you're</v>

19
00:00:57.201 --> 00:00:59.660
<v Speaker 1>crying more easily or more sensitive to</v>
<v Speaker 1>rejection,</v>

20
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.440
<v Speaker 1>it's actually good to pay attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sorts of things because the truth</v>

21
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker 1>is the rest of the month you're sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ceiling that over.</v>

22
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:09.410
<v Speaker 1>You're repressing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're stifling it,</v>

23
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:10.940
<v Speaker 1>you're covering over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:13.310
<v Speaker 1>but those things are actually important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's your feeling?</v>

25
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.920
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps you're dissatisfied,</v>

26
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm with somebody or a relationship or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something in your life,</v>

27
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>but the rest of the month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breezy and accommodating.</v>

29
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 1>But then those few days before your</v>
<v Speaker 1>period where you do start to be more</v>

30
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 1>discerning and critical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to pay attention to that</v>

31
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:34.520
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we feel our emotions and are able to</v>

32
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Speaker 1>express,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:37.280
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is upsetting to me.</v>

34
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.480
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're doing is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody benefits and hopefully</v>

35
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.570
<v Speaker 1>behaviors improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my concerns that I write about</v>

36
00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:47.630
<v Speaker 1>and Moody bitches is that I'm worried</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because so many people now are</v>

37
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:50.300
<v Speaker 1>choosing to take psychiatric medications</v>
<v Speaker 1>and antidepressants,</v>

38
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.780
<v Speaker 1>antianxiety meds that they're tamping</v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

39
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they feel and you know,</v>

40
00:01:56.931 --> 00:02:00.350
<v Speaker 1>when sometimes intuition is about having</v>
<v Speaker 1>an uneasy feeling,</v>

41
00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:01.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something is wrong and I'm a little bit</v>

42
00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:06.971
<v Speaker 1>anxious and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you stop and think about how you're</v>

43
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:10.520
<v Speaker 1>feeling and you pay attention to whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get anxious or not,</v>

44
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.560
<v Speaker 1>you can really take advantage of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The further away we get from nature and</v>

45
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.220
<v Speaker 1>from what is natural for us as social</v>
<v Speaker 1>primates,</v>

46
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.400
<v Speaker 1>the more sick and miserable we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

47
00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:24.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing this in my private practice</v>

48
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:27.500
<v Speaker 1>in psychiatry for decades now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

49
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.540
<v Speaker 1>that if someone is sort of truer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and how they feel and how</v>

50
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:34.850
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also doing things that are more</v>

51
00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:39.110
<v Speaker 1>natural for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like moving your body,</v>

52
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.620
<v Speaker 1>being outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting some sun.</v>

53
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.611
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:48.611
<v Speaker 1>there are very real consequences to</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving away from nature and what's</v>

55
00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:50.420
<v Speaker 1>natural for us.</v>
