1
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.850
<v Speaker 1>I think the most important thing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>an astronaut is,</v>

2
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:14.510
<v Speaker 1>is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to take for first of all,</v>

3
00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:18.620
<v Speaker 1>take for a given.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a person's done pretty well at</v>

4
00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:19.230
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has the intelligence and all that to,</v>

6
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:23.620
<v Speaker 1>to learn new systems and new things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

7
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>but after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important thing I think is</v>

8
00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>being able to get along with others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:29.240
<v Speaker 1>flexibility and teamwork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:32.840
<v Speaker 1>those issues because as we get flight</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer and longer and space,</v>

11
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.910
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are really important factors.</v>

12
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Even on short shuttle missions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:39.290
<v Speaker 1>those are important factors to put a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crew together that can work together</v>

14
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:41.150
<v Speaker 1>effectively as a team that can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>

15
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.610
<v Speaker 1>And so I think for an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the most important thing is</v>

17
00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:46.850
<v Speaker 1>being able to work with others.</v>

18
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>NASA interest,</v>

19
00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:55.870
<v Speaker 1>stealing hadn't done that much until</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly recently because we'd always</v>

20
00:00:55.871 --> 00:00:58.720
<v Speaker 1>flown short missions and we're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals and,</v>

21
00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.650
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.820
<v Speaker 1>the thinking as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:02.990
<v Speaker 1>everyone get along for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.300
<v Speaker 1>two week mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

25
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.530
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone can,</v>

26
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.380
<v Speaker 1>so it hasn't really been a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Russians had been flying long</v>

27
00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:10.810
<v Speaker 1>duration cruise since the early</v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>

28
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.920
<v Speaker 1>And in the early days they've ended at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least two missions early because of</v>

29
00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:17.710
<v Speaker 1>conflicts within the crew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they learned early on the importance</v>

30
00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:20.680
<v Speaker 1>of studying this and making sure you put</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right crew together.</v>

31
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since our,</v>

32
00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:24.700
<v Speaker 1>we began our work together on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>international space station with the</v>

33
00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Russians in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

34
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.483
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>

35
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.770
<v Speaker 1>early two thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've started to,</v>

36
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.830
<v Speaker 1>NASA has started to learn the importance</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this kind of work.</v>

37
00:01:32.831 --> 00:01:36.940
<v Speaker 1>And so NASA is looking much more into it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and funding more work into this,</v>

38
00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:39.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through both directly by NASA as well as</v>

39
00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:42.640
<v Speaker 1>through the NSP Ri.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think it's important work and</v>

40
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.700
<v Speaker 1>we are now fully on board and</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing that it's important</v>

41
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.200
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
