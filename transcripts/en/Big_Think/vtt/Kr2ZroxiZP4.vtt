1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.180
<v Speaker 1>In its origins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A liberal education always had science</v>

2
00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>in it though interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people studied science in ancient Greece</v>

3
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>and Rome in the Middle Ages or until</v>
<v Speaker 1>very recently for precisely the opposite</v>

4
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>reason that people are now told to study</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

5
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>We are now tells you should study it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a practical skill that you</v>

6
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>can use in the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 1>in ancient Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the practical skills that got you jobs</v>

8
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>and got your career where rhetoric and</v>
<v Speaker 1>oratory and a study of history and law</v>

9
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>science was seen as a kind of abstract</v>
<v Speaker 1>quest for knowledge.</v>

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.540
<v Speaker 1>The only reason you were doing it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental stimulation and yet for hundreds</v>

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>and hundreds of years people studied</v>
<v Speaker 1>science really just to try to answer the</v>

12
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>big questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no sense that it could be</v>

13
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>applied in a way that was practical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would provide you with a career.</v>

14
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a very modern conception of</v>
<v Speaker 1>science and so I think what's</v>

15
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>interesting is that even then when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought science was useless,</v>

16
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 1>we studied it used us in a practical</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

17
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Today my argument will be yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about that length and breadth of</v>

18
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say their English is useless.</v>

19
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Yale has opened a campus in Singapore</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they've done is they've tried</v>

20
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 1>to reimagine what a liberal education</v>
<v Speaker 1>would look like.</v>

21
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've also tried to reimagine what</v>

22
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>it would look like in a global context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a core that for the first two</v>

23
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 1>years there is a series of required</v>
<v Speaker 1>courses.</v>

24
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the requirements are more in method</v>

25
00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:34.011
<v Speaker 1>of inquiry that is in critical thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than in a particular subject or a</v>

26
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>particular set of books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Study Aristotle,</v>

27
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.030
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time you read Confucius</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was aristotle's contemporary and you</v>

28
00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:45.330
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did aristotle have certain concerns</v>

29
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:47.970
<v Speaker 1>about politics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Confucius had others.</v>

30
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>What explains this difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea here would be to try to</v>

31
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.350
<v Speaker 1>understand that the west is not the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in the world,</v>

32
00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>that there is a much broader universe</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you understand the differences and</v>

33
00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>similarities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these subjects have deep a long</v>

34
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 1>traditions and feed various parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human brain and the human soul.</v>

35
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.040
<v Speaker 1>And so recognize that what seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>fashionable when one Arrow will not seem</v>

36
00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:15.720
<v Speaker 1>fashionable in another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they all together interact and</v>

37
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>comprise a liberal education.</v>
