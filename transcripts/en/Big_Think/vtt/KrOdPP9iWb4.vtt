00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>In some of my recent writings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've argued that,</v>

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>global trade does seem to be driving</v>

3
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.410
<v Speaker 1>down wages for unskilled or semiskilled</v>
<v Speaker 1>workers and countries like the United</v>

4
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>States in western Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is an important</v>

5
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>political issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>there's no question that inequality has</v>
<v Speaker 1>risen in the United States.</v>

7
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wages,</v>

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for ordinary workers have been fairly</v>

9
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>stagnant or have only risen a small</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount,</v>

10
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while incomes at the high end of the</v>

11
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>salary scale have gone up a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at the very top of the income</v>

12
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:43.230
<v Speaker 1>incomes have gone up spectacularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do think that's a very important</v>

14
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that trying to address</v>

15
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 1>that by restricting trade is not likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>to succeed.</v>

16
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes the whole country poor.</v>

17
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad way to treat the developing</v>

18
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The developing world is benefiting a lot</v>

19
00:00:57.631 --> 00:00:59.020
<v Speaker 1>from this regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>so if you look at the whole look around</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the whole world,</v>

21
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to try to pursue a solution</v>

22
00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>in the United States that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the poor countries poor?</v>

23
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't appeal to me.</v>

24
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't accept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>the notion that restricting trade can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>any part of a progressive agenda.</v>

26
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I like to think of myself as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic,</v>

27
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think when you worry about wages</v>

28
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>for ordinary workers in the u s which I</v>
<v Speaker 1>do worry about,</v>

29
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to look at the tax</v>
<v Speaker 1>system in the United States.</v>

30
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to look at public</v>
<v Speaker 1>expenditure on education and key</v>

31
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:32.280
<v Speaker 1>services that actually reach ordinary</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

32
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>So I think what Larry Summers is arguing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there are a fiscal measures and</v>

33
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 1>policy measures you could take that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would really make life better for the</v>

34
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>working class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Larry Summers is arguing</v>

35
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>against the free trade regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's smart enough to realize</v>

36
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>that if you don't do something for</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary workers in the United States,</v>

37
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 1>you may lose the political support for</v>
<v Speaker 1>free trade.</v>

38
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>And that really is an important engine</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the whole global growth.</v>
