1
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2
00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:09.434
<v Speaker 1>the today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two you just mentioned are two that </v>

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.290
<v Speaker 1>reasons I'm cooking really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4
00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:12.981
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:13.814
<v Speaker 1>Eliot Coleman as a farmer in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>northeastern part of Maine that I was </v>

6
00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:20.000
<v Speaker 1>frustrated with this shortness of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing season.</v>

7
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he tells a story,</v>

9
00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:24.644
<v Speaker 1>it's great storyteller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he tells a story about how he was </v>

10
00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:29.270
<v Speaker 1>thinking of moving to France or to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italy.</v>

11
00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:30.104
<v Speaker 1>And he was looking at a map and he saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>that his farm is on the same latitude </v>

12
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.350
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.840
<v Speaker 1>northern Italy and southern France </v>
<v Speaker 1>provence.</v>

14
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.100
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>he knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were vegetables,</v>

17
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were,</v>

18
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.733
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>daylight determined not temperature </v>

19
00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:50.504
<v Speaker 1>determinant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you could keep it above 32 </v>

20
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:52.274
<v Speaker 1>degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could grow everything that you grow </v>

21
00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:58.580
<v Speaker 1>in northern Italy and southern France in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the winter.</v>

22
00:00:58.581 --> 00:00:59.414
<v Speaker 1>You could do that in me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as long as you can control the </v>

23
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:02.420
<v Speaker 1>temperature and not have it dip to 32 </v>
<v Speaker 1>degrees.</v>

24
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.250
<v Speaker 1>So he invented these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

25
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>these really revolutionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greenhouses,</v>

27
00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 1>so sort of hoop houses that prevented </v>
<v Speaker 1>ice crystallization and the planet and,</v>

28
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.260
<v Speaker 1>and got his farm going in ways that very</v>
<v Speaker 1>few people I've been able to do.</v>

29
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:20.780
<v Speaker 1>And now he's been mimicked all around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world really.</v>

30
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.663
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was an inspiration for me because </v>

31
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.850
<v Speaker 1>in college when I was cooking for him on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

32
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.581
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Blue Hill farm was a great asset to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

34
00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:29.444
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 300 acres of pasture land and part </v>

35
00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:33.290
<v Speaker 1>of the problem with farming and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>northeast of course,</v>

36
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:34.700
<v Speaker 1>is the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do from,</v>

37
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.070
<v Speaker 1>from December to May.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

38
00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:40.720
<v Speaker 1>and most of these farmers have other </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs during this time and,</v>

39
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.530
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very sort of,</v>

40
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a low revenue stream time.</v>

41
00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:48.290
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what elliot invented,</v>

42
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:49.124
<v Speaker 1>or what Elliot took advantage of was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that very few farmers had </v>

43
00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:52.220
<v Speaker 1>thought about.</v>

44
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he did it by making money doing it,</v>

45
00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.114
<v Speaker 1>which is the key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was a huge influence in me and my </v>

46
00:01:58.251 --> 00:01:59.630
<v Speaker 1>thinking that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.120
<v Speaker 1>ultimately if I got good enough and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

48
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>and could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neil can make a career of cooking,</v>

50
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blue Hill would be an asset for,</v>

51
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:08.244
<v Speaker 1>for a supply chain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's Joel Salitan who did </v>

52
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.350
<v Speaker 1>everything and I'm just talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>really on the animal.</v>

53
00:02:12.351 --> 00:02:15.950
<v Speaker 1>And it took advantage of this landscape </v>
<v Speaker 1>in ways that other farmers hadn't by,</v>

54
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.173
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by raising different species of animals </v>

55
00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:19.904
<v Speaker 1>in the same space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so both of these men informed me </v>

56
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:24.794
<v Speaker 1>greatly and then ultimately stone barns </v>
<v Speaker 1>great late because we've kind of </v>

57
00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:29.600
<v Speaker 1>mimicked each of their operations at </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone barns,</v>

58
00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:32.210
<v Speaker 1>made it our own for Westchester County,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

59
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.510
<v Speaker 1>their basic philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.020
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

61
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.640
<v Speaker 2>is all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's humbling.</v>

62
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this 23,000</v>

63
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>square foot greenhouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

64
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>on the Elliot side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.920
<v Speaker 1>that's Eliot Coleman writ large and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

67
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

68
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made for him.</v>

69
00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:54.780
<v Speaker 1>It was built for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on,</v>

72
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.830
<v Speaker 1>on Westchester County,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say,</v>

73
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the taxes,</v>

74
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.323
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Labor that's a necessary for this </v>

75
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>part of the country versus where Elliot </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

76
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>So it needed to be quite a bit larger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than what Elliot does.</v>

77
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.473
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the underpinnings of what he wrote </v>

78
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>so outright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he writes so eloquently about talks</v>

79
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>about going about is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a strong soil,</v>

80
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

81
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>planting,</v>

82
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>

83
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

84
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take advantage of our natural,</v>

85
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our natural ecology.</v>

87
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 1>we now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just harvested last week,</v>

89
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just harvested the farm,</v>

90
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.810
<v Speaker 1>just harvested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

91
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>carrots from both the greenhouse and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>field,</v>

92
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 1>and they're the best carrots of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

93
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.973
<v Speaker 1>And so what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people generally talk about the </v>

94
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>northeast as I was saying before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

95
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

96
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 1>it's dead during the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.393
<v Speaker 1>But in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for certain vegetables like root </v>

98
00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:56.741
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carrots,</v>

99
00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:59.340
<v Speaker 1>and parsnips and Rutabaga and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

100
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.380
<v Speaker 1>and celery root,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

101
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.210
<v Speaker 1>if you are willing to use hoop houses or</v>
<v Speaker 1>use something that,</v>

102
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 1>that can prevent the temperature from </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling below 32 degrees,</v>

103
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>you can actually have vegetables that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are better than any place in the country</v>

104
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>because the starches through the coal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the freezing turn to sugars,</v>

105
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these phrases.</v>

106
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:21.670
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

107
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we took a bricks test of this carrot.</v>

108
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Now I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this particular card,</v>

109
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:28.320
<v Speaker 1>I went on the Internet and I found the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bricks test is,</v>

110
00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:30.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parts per billion of sugar in the,</v>

111
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 1>in the vegetable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

112
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 1>So we squeezed a little bit of carrot </v>
<v Speaker 1>juice on and took a reading and I looked</v>

113
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:38.130
<v Speaker 1>on the internet and they said the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest reading for this type of care,</v>

114
00:04:38.131 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 1>it was 14.6.</v>

115
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 1>It took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

116
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.100
<v Speaker 1>took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

117
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought of it and read it.</v>

118
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 1>And it was 15.8</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally off the charts.</v>

119
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.473
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was speaking to a plant </v>

120
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 1>scientist who happens also to be a poet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think he described it.</v>

121
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.543
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that when a vegetable gets </v>

122
00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:57.844
<v Speaker 1>through a root vegetable or actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>other vegetables like Kale and Swiss </v>

123
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:03.860
<v Speaker 1>chard and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

124
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brussel sprouts,</v>

125
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 1>but in this case and dead of winter when</v>
<v Speaker 1>these root vegetables and they're in the</v>

126
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:11.290
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel the freeze coming,</v>

127
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.273
<v Speaker 1>they convert the starches to sugars to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try and raise their body temperature </v>

128
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>about like making ice cream to vent ice </v>
<v Speaker 1>crystallization.</v>

129
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.053
<v Speaker 1>They're raising their body temperatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the ice crystallization means </v>

130
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>

131
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 1>I think poetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

132
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're tasting is sweetness and </v>

133
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 1>what the plant is telling you is I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to die.</v>

134
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's taking advantage,</v>

135
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:33.844
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is sort of Elliot and Joel's</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any of these sustainable agriculture </v>

136
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.683
<v Speaker 1>minded individuals is taking advantage </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your natural ecology to produce </v>

137
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:45.340
<v Speaker 1>delicious and by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthful food.</v>

138
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a low impact on your environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

139
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.410
<v Speaker 1>that's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on the,</v>

140
00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:52.440
<v Speaker 1>on the animal side of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

141
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 1>one of the great benefits of being in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this New England areas,</v>

142
00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>grass is grassland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

143
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.561
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:02.800
<v Speaker 1>our goal and the goal of the farmers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

145
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.703
<v Speaker 1>that practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animal husbandry at stone barns is </v>

146
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:07.360
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to,</v>

147
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.223
<v Speaker 1>to take advantage to keep their eye on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sunlight and have the sunlight feed </v>

148
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 1>the grass and have the grasp of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and the animals feed us,</v>

149
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the minimum amount of,</v>

150
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.833
<v Speaker 1>of grain inputs that we can take from </v>
<v Speaker 1>other farms outside of stone barns and </v>

151
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 1>use what's in our own natural ecology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what provides not only,</v>

152
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most sustainable meats,</v>

153
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.363
<v Speaker 1>but also the most delicious because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grass is this buffet of different </v>

154
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 1>flavors and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nutrients and,</v>

155
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it adds subtleties and the flavor of</v>

156
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:37.904
<v Speaker 1>the meat that you can't find elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are two examples of many that </v>

157
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 1>take advantage of our natural ecology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

158
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and produced better tasting food.</v>

159
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.933
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
