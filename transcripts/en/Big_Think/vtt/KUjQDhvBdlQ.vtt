00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Look at the stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>top 10% performers versus people who are</v>

2
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:16.200
<v Speaker 1>just mediocre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just at the average.</v>

3
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a way to do a systematic</v>

4
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:23.721
<v Speaker 1>analysis of the capabilities or</v>
<v Speaker 1>competencies that stars have that you</v>

5
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:26.150
<v Speaker 1>don't find that the average David</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcclellan,</v>

6
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the developers of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

7
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>my work in emotional intelligence looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that because it turns out,</v>

8
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>particularly for leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the competencies that</v>

9
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:38.490
<v Speaker 1>distinguish outstanding leaders have</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with Iq,</v>

10
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>with academic intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in this other domain,</v>

11
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether people are getting more</v>

12
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>competitive or not a more viciously</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive,</v>

13
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>I think people have always been</v>
<v Speaker 1>viciously competitive.</v>

14
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are the most effective,</v>

15
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to be competitive in a different</v>

16
00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They compete with themselves.</v>

17
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

18
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:04.800
<v Speaker 1>they have very high standards for</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance and they're continually</v>

19
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand how to learn to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

20
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's the more effective way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>compete,</v>

21
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>improve your own performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not run against the other guy</v>

22
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:15.114
<v Speaker 1>necessarily.</v>

23
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem with Malcolm's book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

24
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.850
<v Speaker 1>he talks about cohorts that have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>privileged by accident,</v>

25
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.300
<v Speaker 1>by experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of them,</v>

26
00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:32.630
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>

27
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.290
<v Speaker 1>as I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish lawyers who were born in the</v>

28
00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:38.830
<v Speaker 1>1930s and some of them were</v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacularly successful.</v>

29
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.570
<v Speaker 1>The problem is he didn't take a sample</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all Jewish lawyers born in thirties</v>

30
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.670
<v Speaker 1>there are also certain to be failures</v>
<v Speaker 1>among them,</v>

31
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>and his model doesn't really explain</v>
<v Speaker 1>what distinguishes the failures from the</v>

32
00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:52.570
<v Speaker 1>outliers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

33
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.490
<v Speaker 1>so it's a good beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

34
00:01:54.491 --> 00:01:57.430
<v Speaker 1>I was waiting for the other shoe to drop</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the book ended.</v>

35
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.520
<v Speaker 1>But Malcolm is a wonderful writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know.</v>
