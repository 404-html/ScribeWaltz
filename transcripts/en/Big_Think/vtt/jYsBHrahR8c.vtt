1
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.780
<v Speaker 1>I think if you are a true food lover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a healthy eater.</v>

2
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:14.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

3
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.800
<v Speaker 1>the term Foodie is completely ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 1>because for someone,</v>

4
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.500
<v Speaker 1>when you meet somebody and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really love to eat.</v>

5
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.530
<v Speaker 1>I think the appropriate answer is who</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't?</v>

6
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.080
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look around.</v>

7
00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Who's you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's not a food lover?</v>

8
00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's a food lover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

9
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.520
<v Speaker 1>do we responsibly do eat for your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit to you?</v>

10
00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:39.700
<v Speaker 1>We fear planets benefit and do you eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best food possible?</v>

11
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.400
<v Speaker 1>If the answer to all of those things is</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

12
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.860
<v Speaker 1>then you're eating well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're eating,</v>

13
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.620
<v Speaker 1>you know if your style of eating is bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your body,</v>

14
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:50.230
<v Speaker 1>if your style of eating it's bad for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

15
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.240
<v Speaker 1>then you are not really eating good</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

16
00:00:52.241 --> 00:00:54.340
<v Speaker 1>You're eating lousy food and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we know,</v>

17
00:00:54.341 --> 00:00:59.341
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of lousy food around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the principled,</v>

18
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.720
<v Speaker 1>the principled way to eat.</v>

19
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.770
<v Speaker 1>If you were going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to eat entirely for my own</v>

20
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:09.200
<v Speaker 1>benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to eat entirely for the benefit</v>

21
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.810
<v Speaker 1>of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to eat in the most responsible</v>

22
00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:15.350
<v Speaker 1>way possible to minimize my carbon</v>
<v Speaker 1>footprint,</v>

23
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Speaker 1>to minimize my impact overall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to minimize my effect on animals.</v>

24
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.470
<v Speaker 1>You would be a Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the bottom line.</v>

25
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.560
<v Speaker 1>The veganism is the most principled way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat.</v>

26
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.440
<v Speaker 1>That there is from the perspective of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own body,</v>

27
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:33.290
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of animals.</v>

28
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Very few people are going to be vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be real.</v>

29
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

30
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 1>what's next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

31
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.170
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand you have vegans and on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other hand you have people who eat</v>

32
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.010
<v Speaker 1>whatever they feel like eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a middle ground.</v>

33
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.550
<v Speaker 1>The problem with the way most Americans</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat right now is that we are about as</v>

34
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:58.010
<v Speaker 1>far from veganism as we could be.</v>

35
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.010
<v Speaker 1>So if Egan would get 100% of his or her</v>
<v Speaker 1>calories from plants,</v>

36
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.620
<v Speaker 1>most Americans get 90% of their calories</v>
<v Speaker 1>from processed food,</v>

37
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.820
<v Speaker 1>junk food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and animal products.</v>

38
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.300
<v Speaker 1>So the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is to move in the direction of</v>

39
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:20.060
<v Speaker 1>eating more unprocessed plant food than</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do now.</v>

40
00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:22.220
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's got a different starting</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

41
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.340
<v Speaker 1>If you eat 20 cheeseburgers a week or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the equivalent,</v>

42
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.970
<v Speaker 1>you might look at eating 15</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheeseburgers or weak or the equivalent.</v>

43
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.660
<v Speaker 1>If you're eating 15 you might look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating 10 and so on.</v>

44
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:36.320
<v Speaker 1>And I think if people think about what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>best for their body,</v>

45
00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:39.710
<v Speaker 1>what's best for the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is eating unprocessed plant</v>

46
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:44.711
<v Speaker 1>food and then think about how can I eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of that stuff at the expense of me,</v>

47
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.403
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.230
<v Speaker 1>which was the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also at the expensive processed food</v>

49
00:02:51.231 --> 00:02:52.064
<v Speaker 1>and junk food.</v>

50
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>The idea is to eat as many of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>processed plants as you can.</v>

51
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>What are plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plants or vegetables,</v>

52
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legumes,</v>

53
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 1>which means beans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuts and seeds.</v>

54
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I leaving out?</v>

55
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.360
<v Speaker 1>I think that's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

56
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.520
<v Speaker 1>the idea is to eat as many unprocessed</v>
<v Speaker 1>plants as you possibly can and to eat</v>

57
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>those instead of eating processed foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>junk foods,</v>

58
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 1>and animal products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What works for me,</v>

59
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>what's worked for me for just about</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years now.</v>

60
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 1>It works for me is to eat very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strict diet of plants only and</v>

61
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:36.710
<v Speaker 1>unprocessed plants only from the time I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wake up in the morning until dinner</v>

62
00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so from the time I wake up until roughly</v>

63
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat a lot of fruit.</v>

64
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>I eat a lot of vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat some whole grains and sometimes I</v>

65
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>have some beans and that's pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

66
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>And then at night I eat whatever I want</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the,</v>

67
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>which includes meat and which includes</v>
<v Speaker 1>wine and which includes pasta and bread</v>

68
00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:00.070
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge change for me.</v>

69
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I think that if you think of your diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a seesaw with the,</v>

70
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 1>you know the animal products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process through the junk food on the</v>

71
00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:11.200
<v Speaker 1>heavy side as it is for most people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unprocessed plants on the light side</v>

72
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>as it is for most people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for me,</v>

73
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:17.860
<v Speaker 1>my cso went from looking something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this to looking something like this.</v>

74
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.860
<v Speaker 1>I think that to the extent other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can eat that way,</v>

75
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:25.861
<v Speaker 1>they will have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a lesser impact on the planet,</v>

76
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.720
<v Speaker 1>improve their health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably lose weight,</v>

77
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.793
<v Speaker 1>feel better.</v>

78
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Think I just saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changed the way because if some of</v>

79
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>the things we've been talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

80
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 1>one is that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recognize that um,</v>

81
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>one of the highest contributors to</v>
<v Speaker 1>greenhouse gases and global warming is</v>

82
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the industrial production of</v>

83
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 1>livestock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I decided,</v>

84
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one good reason to eat less</v>

85
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other good reasons he lets me is</v>

86
00:04:57.041 --> 00:05:00.550
<v Speaker 1>that I was in my mid fifties and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>health wasn't what it used to be.</v>

87
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 1>So I was overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had bad knees,</v>

88
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I had sleep apnea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had high cholesterol,</v>

89
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 1>I had high blood sugar or borderline</v>
<v Speaker 1>high blood sugar.</v>

90
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 1>I think that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

91
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided</v>

92
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 1>to change my diet and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so obvious to everyone who pays any</v>

93
00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>attention to nutrition at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you want to be healthier,</v>

94
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:26.190
<v Speaker 1>the way to do that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.530
<v Speaker 1>as I've already said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to eat fewer animal products and eat</v>

96
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 1>less processed and junk food.</v>

97
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 1>So I started to do that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it worked.</v>

98
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 1>I lost 35 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

99
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.710
<v Speaker 1>gained five of them back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>

100
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slept,</v>

101
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.760
<v Speaker 1>sleep apnea went away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I slept better,</v>

102
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:45.120
<v Speaker 1>my knees bothered me much less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

103
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 1>I ran the New York marathon last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

104
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.590
<v Speaker 1>my cholesterol is back to normal and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood sugar is back to normal.</v>

105
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:53.080
<v Speaker 1>So it all worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not a coincidence.</v>

106
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one would say it was a coincidence,</v>

107
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.880
<v Speaker 1>actually not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

108
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.630
<v Speaker 1>there's some things I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that it's important to</v>

109
00:06:04.631 --> 00:06:07.000
<v Speaker 1>recognize that there's no sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>single,</v>

110
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arsenic and cyanide aside,</v>

111
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.050
<v Speaker 1>there's not really a single ingredient</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to outright kill you.</v>

112
00:06:14.051 --> 00:06:15.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actually some evidence that a</v>

113
00:06:15.461 --> 00:06:20.230
<v Speaker 1>single can of soda can trigger diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's not a lot of eps evidence</v>

114
00:06:20.231 --> 00:06:22.090
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In general.</v>

115
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.750
<v Speaker 1>One ingredient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one little kind of food,</v>

116
00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:28.840
<v Speaker 1>one one meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day,</v>

117
