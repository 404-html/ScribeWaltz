1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>I think that this particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with Brian Williams is part of a</v>

2
00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>larger phenomenon in television news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's become increasingly under siege</v>

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.360
<v Speaker 1>from so many alternatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first with Cable News,</v>

4
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>alternatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then with the Internet and mobile.</v>

5
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's put enormous pressure on</v>

6
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>these organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately in my view,</v>

7
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the organizations have responded by</v>

8
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>taking their anchors and the reporters</v>
<v Speaker 1>and making them the story far too often.</v>

9
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's understandable.</v>

10
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a marketing decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a branding decision,</v>

11
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's not fundamentally what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe journalists should be doing.</v>

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent years working with Peter</v>

13
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Jennings and Peter believed firmly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all embraced the notion that in the</v>

14
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:53.310
<v Speaker 1>end we're not the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're reporting the story.</v>

15
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.830
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as the journalist becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story,</v>

16
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>you're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have pr staffs and marketing staffs</v>

17
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>who are coaxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are urging,</v>

18
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.160
<v Speaker 1>who are reinforcing any story that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>their reporter or their anchor appear</v>

19
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>larger than life.</v>

20
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we decided that reporters have to</v>

21
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>be war heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reporters don't fight wars,</v>

22
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>they report on worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

23
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not unique to Brian and that is not</v>

24
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:23.790
<v Speaker 1>unique to NBC News.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And therefore I am concerned about some</v>

25
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 1>of the other news organizations who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>so quick to judge.</v>

26
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>I can't predict what will happen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian Williams.</v>

27
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.780
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anyone who can</v>

28
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>predict that right now because I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure anyone knows what all the facts</v>

29
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The starting point is to find out what</v>

30
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>the facts are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>what I do anticipate based on what I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard so far,</v>

32
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.170
<v Speaker 1>is that a NBC news will need to find a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

33
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know what that way is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't dare try to tell them what</v>

34
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>the way it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they need to find a way to</v>

35
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>send two messages.</v>

36
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.930
<v Speaker 1>And this is the hard part is you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>send both messages provided Brian comes</v>

37
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:02.400
<v Speaker 1>through this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And based on what I know right now,</v>

38
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>I would expect him to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to reinforce that you still</v>

39
00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:08.300
<v Speaker 1>believe in him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you still value him,</v>

40
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>that you value all of his years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>service,</v>

41
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the wonderful journalism he's done</v>

42
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 1>through the years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>

43
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.960
<v Speaker 1>and number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one is above the truth.</v>

44
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>This is the number one priority for any</v>
<v Speaker 1>news organization is to have their</v>

45
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 1>credibility and their trustworthiness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their relationship with the</v>

46
00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:30.480
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore they have to find some way</v>

47
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.590
<v Speaker 1>of planting a very big flag saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we believe in Brian,</v>

48
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.800
<v Speaker 1>but we really take this terribly</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

49
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>This is more important than anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else we do.</v>
