1
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Immediately I</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to a day school or prep school in</v>

2
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Jeddah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only one to an international modern</v>

3
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>standard in the kingdom at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>

4
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially recruited into an Islamic</v>

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.280
<v Speaker 1>group by a charismatic Syrian Gym</v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher at his prep school who mentored</v>

6
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:29.010
<v Speaker 1>him and taught him and essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>indoctrinated him into the Muslim</v>

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Brotherhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the beginning of a series</v>

8
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:36.081
<v Speaker 1>of relationships with mentors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially professional mentors that</v>

9
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:40.120
<v Speaker 1>seemed also to have a sort of personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>role in his life of dilemmas.</v>

10
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a collaborator and,</v>

11
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.740
<v Speaker 1>and Co founder of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

12
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the precursor organization to al Qaeda</v>

13
00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:52.960
<v Speaker 1>during the anti-soviet war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ayman Elza Walker,</v>

14
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Speaker 1>relater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptian who co founded,</v>

15
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>al Qaeda with him though,</v>

16
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>is while he was his deputy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was also in a,</v>

17
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.860
<v Speaker 1>in a sort of biographical sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also a mentor and a and a,</v>

18
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of a patron of Osama.</v>

19
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.840
<v Speaker 1>The overall narrative is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not too surprising,</v>

21
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>but worth just sketching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is he's a shy,</v>

22
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.060
<v Speaker 1>a privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy young man who is recruited into</v>

23
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.420
<v Speaker 1>International Islamic radicalism and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentor and doted on primarily at first</v>

24
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:35.481
<v Speaker 1>because of his money and his older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more ambitious mentors want access to</v>

25
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 1>what he has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only his own deep pockets,</v>

26
00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>but also the fundraising world that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>can open up in Saudi Arabia,</v>

27
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 1>but gradually as he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he ages and as he matures,</v>

28
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.240
<v Speaker 1>he either overthrows his mentors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are slowly separates from them and all</v>

29
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.960
<v Speaker 1>and develops his own ambition and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>own very full egotistical sense of his</v>

30
00:01:56.131 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>own capabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think in the end he is a</v>

31
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>prisoner of his mentors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in instead he,</v>

32
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>he sort of grows beyond them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By and large,</v>

33
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.633
<v Speaker 1>evens watery,</v>

34
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.440
<v Speaker 1>always has often been a creature of</v>
<v Speaker 1>media and has yearned to be heard.</v>

35
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>And this particularly as he came into</v>
<v Speaker 1>his own and decided that he had a role</v>

36
00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:31.780
<v Speaker 1>to play in this narrative that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagined he had been called into by God</v>

37
00:02:31.781 --> 00:02:33.520
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and where he was drawn.</v>

38
00:02:33.521 --> 00:02:38.521
<v Speaker 1>Also for reasons of his own ambition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he he loved to.</v>

39
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>He had an intuition about a brand</v>
<v Speaker 1>building and about media that was really</v>

40
00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:51.340
<v Speaker 1>one of his core talents and one of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>core insights and a source of much of</v>

41
00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:54.310
<v Speaker 1>his innovation and achievement and after</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11,</v>

42
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.760
<v Speaker 1>he had to repress some of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>instincts because it was too risky to go</v>

43
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>on television as often as he might like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see him when he comes forward.</v>

44
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Even after periods of silence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he comes forward with a video where he</v>

45
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>comes forward with an audio tape and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read through the text of everything</v>

46
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>he's been saying since nine slash 11</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he does surface to talk or you look</v>

47
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>at those videotapes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the impression of someone who's</v>

48
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>in hiding but has access to a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

49
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>He's reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's clearly reading books.</v>

50
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 1>He's clearly as access to the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's on the internet or on</v>

51
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>satellite television and he's and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sometimes you always had the sense</v>

52
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>that he's like watching President Bush</v>
<v Speaker 1>on television,</v>

53
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>make a speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he just gets.</v>

54
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.890
<v Speaker 1>He gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

55
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I gotta I gotTa talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta say something,</v>

56
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 1>bring my media guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he goes and he makes a speech</v>

57
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>and he's almost talking back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the global media.</v>

58
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 1>So I do think is there is clearly an</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulse that he has,</v>

59
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.233
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 1>to be heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how he's always conceived as role</v>

61
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 1>as a vanguard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who stimulates a and encourages</v>

62
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 1>others not as someone who needs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>control a political organization or be</v>

63
00:03:57.821 --> 00:03:59.700
<v Speaker 1>the boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but someone who inspires you.</v>

64
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 2>It sort of confirms</v>

65
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.400
<v Speaker 1>the little bits of information that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>available about his family's</v>

66
00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this period of exile,</v>

67
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 1>the Sama has had at least four or five</v>
<v Speaker 1>wives.</v>

68
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.210
<v Speaker 1>The wives that are known are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have all returned to their home</v>

69
00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:29.211
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe almost all of his daughters,</v>

70
00:04:29.431 --> 00:04:31.560
<v Speaker 1>if not all of his daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have also returned home.</v>

71
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.370
<v Speaker 1>He has perhaps a dozen or more sons and</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those,</v>

72
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.240
<v Speaker 1>some have returned home and some were</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed like Hamza to be an exile with</v>

73
00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:45.450
<v Speaker 1>him if perhaps living with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps living near him.</v>

74
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.780
<v Speaker 1>There was an exchange between Osama and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his son,</v>

75
00:04:48.781 --> 00:04:53.781
<v Speaker 1>Hamza on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Jihadi websites in late 2001 where a</v>

76
00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Sama essentially wrote a letter to Hamza</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the form of a last will and</v>

77
00:04:58.891 --> 00:05:02.250
<v Speaker 1>testament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Hamza,</v>

78
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.090
<v Speaker 1>along with a couple of other sons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have clearly been with them.</v>

79
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:11.010
<v Speaker 1>They've appeared in videos before as</v>
<v Speaker 1>young jihadi is even at ages nine and 10</v>

80
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.360
<v Speaker 1>by now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hamza,</v>

81
00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I guess I don't know what the video</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows today,</v>

82
00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would guess he's about 16 or 17.</v>

83
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

84
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.310
<v Speaker 1>so he would have been one of the three</v>
<v Speaker 1>or four that you would have guessed was</v>

85
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.170
<v Speaker 1>roughly wherever Osama's hiding along</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pak Afghan frontier that Hamza is</v>

86
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:30.900
<v Speaker 1>out there too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a lot.</v>

87
00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:33.180
<v Speaker 1>And then Mohammed and a couple others</v>
<v Speaker 1>are out there as well.</v>

88
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.080
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a long time</v>

89
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Afghan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan border.</v>

90
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

91
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.850
<v Speaker 1>sometimes to try to play a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

92
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>have this parlor game you could play</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people who watch al Qaeda or the</v>

93
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.550
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to search for bin Ladin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suppose someone walks into the room</v>

94
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>right now and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

95
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>som has been captured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or someone just hit them with a</v>

96
00:05:58.131 --> 00:06:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gay,</v>

97
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

98
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell me where.</v>

99
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Put a map up on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a pin,</v>

100
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.510
<v Speaker 1>put the pin in the map and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 people closest to the whole winds,</v>

101
00:06:09.511 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

102
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 1>who can come closest to where he</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually was.</v>

103
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.250
<v Speaker 1>And so where would you put your pin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would probably put it</v>

104
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>in northwest zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stand around Mirin shot along the</v>

105
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:24.890
<v Speaker 1>border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a area they're controlled by the</v>

106
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] clan that he has long roots</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

107
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 1>There are some risks to him if he stays</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that area.</v>

108
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe it's a little too busy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little too trafficked.</v>

109
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 1>An alternative place where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

110
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:39.530
<v Speaker 1>some other smart people who know them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

111
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.340
<v Speaker 1>they tend to put their pins just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit north of that in Bodger,</v>

112
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically a general area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

113
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 1>around the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the federally administrated tribal</v>

114
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably more north than south would be</v>

115
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:54.944
<v Speaker 1>my best stuff</v>

116
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.050
<v Speaker 2>very</v>
<v Speaker 2>much</v>

117
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.700
<v Speaker 1>at a couple of levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It samas ideology is not very fully</v>

118
00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:10.630
<v Speaker 1>formed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think his analysis or his</v>

119
00:07:10.631 --> 00:07:14.950
<v Speaker 1>ideology or his political program are by</v>
<v Speaker 1>any means.</v>

120
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:19.720
<v Speaker 1>His strengths is he has talents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately,</v>

121
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sense of ideology and,</v>

122
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.420
<v Speaker 1>and strategy is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not one of them.</v>

123
00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:25.720
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

124
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.390
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ultimately I think al Qaeda will be</v>

125
00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:31.240
<v Speaker 1>defeated by the self limiting nature of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his ideology.</v>

126
00:07:31.241 --> 00:07:33.640
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the extent that he has ideology,</v>

127
00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:37.270
<v Speaker 1>it has sort of two levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is a political sort of terra firma</v>

128
00:07:37.271 --> 00:07:41.660
<v Speaker 1>here and now set of grievances in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to give voice to a,</v>

129
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.710
<v Speaker 1>an eclectic array of legitimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>grievances in the Islamic world.</v>

130
00:07:47.321 --> 00:07:51.190
<v Speaker 1>And on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a millenarian view of himself as</v>

131
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:56.110
<v Speaker 1>leading a preordained war called by God</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will end at the end of time and at</v>

132
00:07:56.111 --> 00:07:59.440
<v Speaker 1>both levels the metaphor of a war.</v>

133
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.910
<v Speaker 1>And the fact of war are central to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>claim on his followers.</v>

134
00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:04.840
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

135
00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:09.460
<v Speaker 1>when the Bush administration after nine</v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 11 announces a war against him and</v>

136
00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:14.050
<v Speaker 1>frames a global war in which he is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>adversary,</v>

137
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.220
<v Speaker 1>it provides exactly the narrative that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been.</v>

138
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:22.210
<v Speaker 1>It reinforces and elevates and</v>
<v Speaker 1>accentuates the narrative that he's been</v>

139
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:27.211
<v Speaker 1>developing and certainly he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>embrace and has embraced the sort of</v>

140
00:08:29.651 --> 00:08:34.651
<v Speaker 1>equivalency that the war narrative</v>
<v Speaker 1>provides between himself and say George</v>

141
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:39.070
<v Speaker 1>W dot Bush on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president of the hyper power of the</v>

142
00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:41.590
<v Speaker 1>post early post Cold War period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on the other hand,</v>

143
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Osama bin Ladin leading the righteous</v>
<v Speaker 1>forces of Islam against the oppression,</v>

144
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carried out by that hyper power.</v>

145
00:08:48.521 --> 00:08:52.690
<v Speaker 1>And so the Bush administration sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly quickly realized,</v>

146
00:08:52.691 --> 00:08:57.691
<v Speaker 1>especially after they turned their</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention from pursuing him and toward</v>

147
00:08:57.811 --> 00:09:01.650
<v Speaker 1>invading Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe it wasn't a good idea to call</v>

148
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:03.440
<v Speaker 1>attention to his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

149
00:09:03.441 --> 00:09:05.310
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've gone through this kind of</v>

150
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.020
<v Speaker 1>bipolar or sort of swings in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their attitude towards the psalm as</v>

151
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 1>an adversary trying to not elevate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>by not talking about him,</v>

152
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then that only emphasizes the</v>

153
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:18.210
<v Speaker 1>impunity that he seems to enjoy it.</v>

154
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:24.853
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

155
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:30.070
<v Speaker 1>it's an organization with a particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>leader and deputy leader and a bunch of</v>

156
00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:33.770
<v Speaker 1>committees and a headquarters sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some,</v>

157
00:09:33.771 --> 00:09:36.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a continuous organization that was</v>

158
00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:40.370
<v Speaker 1>founded at meetings in 1988,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has had the same bureaucracy and the</v>

159
00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:42.230
<v Speaker 1>same leader and deputy leader for 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

160
00:09:42.231 --> 00:09:44.120
<v Speaker 1>So there is an organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called Al Qaeda,</v>

161
00:09:44.121 --> 00:09:47.420
<v Speaker 1>has a boss and it has committees that do</v>
<v Speaker 1>finance and media and military.</v>

162
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.790
<v Speaker 1>It's more than that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a movement that inspires</v>

163
00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:54.860
<v Speaker 1>followers who are disconnected from</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders.</v>

164
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.390
<v Speaker 1>It's also a network of likeminded</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations and it's also a brand that</v>

165
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:02.990
<v Speaker 1>attempts to attract other organizations</v>
<v Speaker 1>and adherence,</v>

166
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:08.090
<v Speaker 1>whether in groups or as individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Al Qaeda is I think properly</v>

167
00:10:09.021 --> 00:10:11.720
<v Speaker 1>understood a synthesis of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics today.</v>

168
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Al Qaeda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the organization is resilient militarily</v>

169
00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:21.140
<v Speaker 1>in the sense that they continue to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to run medium sized attacks into</v>

170
00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are struggling politically.</v>

171
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.650
<v Speaker 1>I think they are strategically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

172
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.310
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a corner that they're not likely to</v>

173
00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:34.430
<v Speaker 1>get out of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very easily.</v>

174
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.120
<v Speaker 1>But the organization a is still a factor</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the security threats faced by not</v>

175
00:10:45.921 --> 00:10:49.860
<v Speaker 1>only the United States but also Britain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Germany and Denmark.</v>

176
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.320
<v Speaker 2>I tend to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been my</v>

177
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.920
<v Speaker 1>obvious sort of thoughts previewed the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that,</v>

178
00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:03.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're both right.</v>

179
00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

180
00:11:03.881 --> 00:11:06.140
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a concrete example and,</v>

181
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 1>and I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it proves the case that they're both</v>

182
00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:10.390
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

183
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.190
<v Speaker 1>the July seventh subway bombings in</v>
<v Speaker 1>London,</v>

184
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can add the evidence is</v>

185
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:23.370
<v Speaker 1>pretty well now established that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack was supported by al Qaeda</v>

186
00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:28.371
<v Speaker 1>headquarters in Pakistan and was</v>
<v Speaker 1>supported by the travel that some of the</v>

187
00:11:28.381 --> 00:11:33.381
<v Speaker 1>participants in the plot undertook to</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet al Qaeda operatives in Waziristan.</v>

188
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:39.030
<v Speaker 1>And on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plot originated spontaneously in the</v>

189
00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:43.950
<v Speaker 1>disaffected lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have some Pakistani originated British</v>

190
00:11:43.951 --> 00:11:47.550
<v Speaker 1>citizens in Leeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on the one hand you could say that</v>

191
00:11:47.551 --> 00:11:52.551
<v Speaker 1>attack would never have occurred without</v>
<v Speaker 1>the independent grassroots individually</v>

192
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.640
<v Speaker 1>alienation of the Pakistan Navy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain in leads.</v>

193
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.430
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would not have occurred also without</v>

194
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 1>the resilient al Qaeda organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

195
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.300
<v Speaker 1>it's like an extra drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can emphasize one side of that</v>

196
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:10.690
<v Speaker 1>equation or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but both are present in the narrative.</v>
