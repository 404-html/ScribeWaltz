1
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of things you do from a</v>

2
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.320
<v Speaker 1>practical point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a secretary learns how to say,</v>

3
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions like,</v>

4
00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:24.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should call the social work</v>

5
00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:27.940
<v Speaker 1>department first before we booked this</v>
<v Speaker 1>appointment.</v>

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um hmm,</v>

7
00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:35.041
<v Speaker 1>the schedule looks really full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those things are honestly</v>

8
00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:36.790
<v Speaker 1>practical things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doctors do</v>

9
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.070
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the larger hospitals like my</v>

10
00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:43.340
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>have a free care pool and we'll have</v>
<v Speaker 1>people apply to it so that they can get</v>

12
00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>their care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are delays built into that.</v>

13
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.450
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see that happen.</v>

14
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next thing though is that when</v>

15
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.960
<v Speaker 1>you're committed to the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

16
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.900
<v Speaker 1>I want to help anybody I can coming in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the door.</v>

17
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have the questions of how to</v>

18
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>arrange for their care and manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you how dramatically my</v>

19
00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:14.110
<v Speaker 1>practice changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the Massachusetts health reform</v>

20
00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:14.944
<v Speaker 1>went through.</v>

21
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>We went from being a state with about 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent uninsured and that was about the</v>

22
00:01:18.971 --> 00:01:22.180
<v Speaker 1>percentage of my patients who could not</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay for my treatments.</v>

23
00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:23.380
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

24
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would forgo the surgery costs and the</v>

25
00:01:26.351 --> 00:01:28.720
<v Speaker 1>hospital would eat the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

26
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the medical bills,</v>

27
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.030
<v Speaker 1>but you'd still have to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they going to pay for outpatient</v>

28
00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:36.790
<v Speaker 1>chemotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of radiation treatments,</v>

29
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:39.880
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a nightmare over and over</v>

30
00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:42.010
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

31
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 1>when the reform bill came through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

32
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.270
<v Speaker 1>we put this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been two years and I've not had a</v>

33
00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>patient in those circumstances for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

34
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.520
<v Speaker 1>since then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

36
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.120
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you almost don't notice that used to</v>

37
00:01:58.121 --> 00:01:59.680
<v Speaker 1>grapple with these issues all the time.</v>

38
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I face ethical dilemmas all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

39
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.580
<v Speaker 1>their routine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

40
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>the 19 year old patient who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sticks in my mind because right before</v>

42
00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:18.520
<v Speaker 1>the Massachusetts health reform came</v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

43
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.910
<v Speaker 1>I'd seen her and she had a metastatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>thyroid cancer.</v>

44
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Her cancer had really spread widely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did the surgery and then it turned</v>

45
00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:31.840
<v Speaker 1>out that she needed chemotherapy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>radiation,</v>

46
00:02:31.841 --> 00:02:34.740
<v Speaker 1>but her insurance coverage ran out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She only had a,</v>

47
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>had a $75,000 cap on her policy and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want me to tell her parents about</v>

48
00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:43.250
<v Speaker 1>her condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

49
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.610
<v Speaker 1>because she knew they would try to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way to pay for all of this,</v>

50
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.510
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a kind of ethical dilemma.</v>

51
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would seem to me a no brainer.</v>

52
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>I called her parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sure enough know they,</v>

53
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>they got a second mortgage on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

54
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>They found a way to make damn well sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>their daughter got the treatment she</v>

55
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>needed.</v>

56
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have everything ranging from</v>

57
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.970
<v Speaker 1>someone who um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to leave the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

59
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>they are in the hospital and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were better.</v>

60
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

62
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>things are kind of a mess at home and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd love a couple of extra days in</v>

64
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 1>the hospital even though it's $2,000 a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

65
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

66
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>how do you grapple effect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you kick them out?</v>

67
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>How do you kick them out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do you just say,</v>

68
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.660
<v Speaker 1>this is my patient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

70
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.533
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they,</v>

71
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 1>they're the customer with what they say</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>

72
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.240
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

73
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

74
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find moral questions are,</v>

75
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm a daily part of what you do as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>physician and a part of what makes it so</v>

76
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
