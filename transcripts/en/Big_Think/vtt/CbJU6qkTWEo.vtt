1
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.270
<v Speaker 1>I think I could speak for all the World</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bank employees.</v>

2
00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:15.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a job that is a very,</v>

3
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.450
<v Speaker 1>it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it grabs you really strongly and you,</v>

4
00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:23.720
<v Speaker 1>you do get up early in the morning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look forward to the day are very</v>

5
00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:27.650
<v Speaker 1>interesting work because what could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>more interesting than to work on some</v>

6
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 1>hundred and 50 countries on the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred sectors,</v>

7
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on global issues,</v>

8
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from such an outpost as the World Bank,</v>

9
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:42.221
<v Speaker 1>which is owned by 195 countries of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and from which you do look at the</v>

10
00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:45.760
<v Speaker 1>world as if it was a whole planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

11
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.840
<v Speaker 1>not from the country point of view but</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a sort of overall global point of</v>

12
00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:54.530
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very interesting job to be in</v>

13
00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.440
<v Speaker 1>and you get to learn a lot of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a lot of countries and a lot of</v>

14
00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:03.860
<v Speaker 1>people and the culture of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions is interesting.</v>

15
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.860
<v Speaker 1>It's one where there are 150 or 60</v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalities in the house and you never</v>

16
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>think about the nationality of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues.</v>

17
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.490
<v Speaker 1>You forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has the same jargon.</v>

18
00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:21.491
<v Speaker 1>And codewords and you forget that</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone is Italian or Bangladeshi or</v>

19
00:01:21.951 --> 00:01:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Tanzania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it is a little bit,</v>

20
00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:27.860
<v Speaker 1>it has the culture of the world as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would wish it to have.</v>

21
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.680
<v Speaker 1>I would wish to world had that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture one day.</v>

22
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beyond the Knight Nation State and</v>

23
00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:37.400
<v Speaker 1>the nationality culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of one level above.</v>

24
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.230
<v Speaker 1>And that also makes it very fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the third thing that,</v>

25
00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:44.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had me taking at the World Bank,</v>

26
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:49.421
<v Speaker 1>it's very libertarian institution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of room for debates on</v>

27
00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:53.510
<v Speaker 1>what worked and what didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were a lot of arguments,</v>

28
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:57.230
<v Speaker 1>academic arguments or even practical</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments one way or the other.</v>

29
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.920
<v Speaker 1>And you could do many things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did in my time,</v>

30
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pioneered many new things and I was</v>

31
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:08.480
<v Speaker 1>never whistled back in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was part of the reasons why I saw</v>

32
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:09.530
<v Speaker 1>like the institution</v>

33
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
