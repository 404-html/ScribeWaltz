1
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>There were several steps along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to college at overland and Ohio</v>

2
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>and after that I went to Boston and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>after a couple of years there I went to</v>

3
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:24.201
<v Speaker 1>Grad School in Arizona in Tucson at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Arizona and I stayed there</v>

4
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:31.821
<v Speaker 1>seven years and I met a woman who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>entering the Grad program just as I was</v>

5
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.850
<v Speaker 1>leaving and she was from Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her name's asthma.</v>

6
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.843
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Han.</v>

7
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.420
<v Speaker 1>And we ended up getting married and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>after staying another year in Arizona,</v>

8
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>after her graduation was she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were both eager to go somewhere and</v>

9
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:53.600
<v Speaker 1>try something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>she had just come into the country to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to university and then Grad school,</v>

11
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>so she wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't an immigration thing or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

13
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>So we looked around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we applied for jobs overseas.</v>

14
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>We ended up going to Morocco for three</v>
<v Speaker 1>years as English teachers.</v>

15
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

16
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>that was interesting.</v>

17
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:20.803
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

18
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.800
<v Speaker 1>my world view of the states has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly changing over time,</v>

19
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is nothing like leaving the</v>

20
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 1>country to help you look back and see</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country more clearly.</v>

21
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing like living with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are quite skeptical about the</v>

22
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>intentions of your country to make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that.</v>

23
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

24
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I have to say that I'm just on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal level both in Morocco and then</v>

25
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.690
<v Speaker 1>in then people are incredibly friendly</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hospitable and interested and kind</v>

26
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.850
<v Speaker 1>of this idea that they're all just</v>
<v Speaker 1>raving lunatics a like you see on the</v>

27
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>cover of Newsweek</v>
<v Speaker 1>is simply not true.</v>

28
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a lie is a lie designed to make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay home.</v>

29
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>And so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people have very strong opinions</v>

30
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 1>about Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Palestine.</v>

31
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:21.321
<v Speaker 1>They think that Israel gets billions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars per year,</v>

32
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:24.850
<v Speaker 1>which it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Palestinians get nothing and the</v>

33
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.750
<v Speaker 1>it money is being used for repression</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so forth.</v>

34
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>That's a legitimate political opinion to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

35
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Does this mean that they walk up to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and beat me up on the street?</v>

36
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does not.</v>

37
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>And that I wish that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>perception could change.</v>
