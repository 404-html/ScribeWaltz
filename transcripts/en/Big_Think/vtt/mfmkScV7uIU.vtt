1
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>It's odd that I've written two novels</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of 12 about Americans who leaves</v>

2
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:19.450
<v Speaker 1>this country and go and live in Canada</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stayed there.</v>

3
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although,</v>

4
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the characters who do that are very</v>

5
00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:29.950
<v Speaker 1>different and their reasons for doing so</v>
<v Speaker 1>are also different.</v>

6
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reasons are political and the case</v>

7
00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 1>of Johnny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll write the narrative of a</v>

8
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.720
<v Speaker 1>peripheral and meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>he does hate this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the case for Danny Boucher.</v>

10
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Lupo and his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fugitives.</v>

11
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.290
<v Speaker 1>They're running away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not their choice,</v>

12
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go to Canada.</v>

13
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Although it does become Danny's choice</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stay.</v>

14
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do that.</v>

15
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do it primarily as a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if I'm going to continue to pick</v>

16
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 1>on my country in some way as a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.700
<v Speaker 1>I better live here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I better be here firsthand.</v>

18
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm not as an expatriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.720
<v Speaker 1>so I would disagree with the Ketchum</v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

20
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in last night in twisted river when he</v>

21
00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:34.141
<v Speaker 1>tells Danny that he should leave the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country and stay away.</v>

22
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

23
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I would disagree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.310
<v Speaker 1>in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my case to,</v>

25
00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:44.770
<v Speaker 1>unlike Danny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have three children and four</v>

26
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.570
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going anywhere.</v>

27
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live part time in Toronto because my</v>

28
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.450
<v Speaker 1>wife is Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.490
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm an American and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always</v>

31
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.310
<v Speaker 1>will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking in the last years of</v>

32
00:02:03.311 --> 00:02:08.311
<v Speaker 1>the Vietnam War that I would never see</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country as divided again as it was</v>

33
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.210
<v Speaker 1>in those years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was wrong.</v>

34
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:14.960
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.350
<v Speaker 1>we as a people or more divided today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.860
<v Speaker 1>I think back in the latter years of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam War,</v>

37
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>it was chiefly that war that divided us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's fair or enough to say</v>

38
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>that we are divided today because of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or only because of the wars in</v>

39
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan and in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are other deep political</v>

40
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.110
<v Speaker 1>and cultural rifts in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Conservative,</v>

41
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.400
<v Speaker 1>liberal riffs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious and not religious rifts.</v>

42
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I think there are any number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences among Americans that a</v>

43
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.320
<v Speaker 1>divide us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>angrily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.680
<v Speaker 1>and sharply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.190
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:03:14.191 --> 00:03:14.851
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

48
00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:17.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

50
00:03:18.811 --> 00:03:21.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the highest hopes,</v>

51
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

52
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Obama.</v>

53
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.100
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

54
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm very excited about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he has inherited such a mess,</v>

55
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.120
<v Speaker 1>such a turmoil that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope people</v>

56
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>will give him time</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sort it out and to undo at least some</v>

57
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.070
<v Speaker 1>of the damage that George W Bush did to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country.</v>

58
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.760
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm already too old to</v>

59
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.720
<v Speaker 1>realistically imagine that even if Mr</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama is hugely successful,</v>

60
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.280
<v Speaker 1>that he can actually undo all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>damage.</v>

61
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George W dot Bush did to this country's</v>

62
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.650
<v Speaker 1>reputation to the way we are seeing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of this country to the way other</v>

63
00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:39.321
<v Speaker 1>people in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a CIS maybe that can be recovered or</v>

64
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.610
<v Speaker 1>that reputation that we once had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be regained that good reputation.</v>

65
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it will be regained in my</v>

66
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 1>children's lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

67
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't expect</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see it</v>

68
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.730
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>

69
00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:59.550
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of anti Americanism around the</v>

70
00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:04.220
<v Speaker 1>world that is simply a hostile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 1>and vehement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

72
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.080
<v Speaker 1>and I'm motivated</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the desire to see any democratic way</v>

73
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:16.770
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm destroyed.</v>

74
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's another kind of anti</v>

75
00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Americanism that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

76
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.050
<v Speaker 1>contributed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

77
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.033
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.540
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

79
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.880
<v Speaker 1>it embarrasses me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

80
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am sick of seeing,</v>

81
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country's a bully,</v>

82
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.600
<v Speaker 1>patriotism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>used as a smokescreen and as a cover up</v>
<v Speaker 1>for things we haven't done right.</v>
