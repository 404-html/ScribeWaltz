1
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.080
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't disturb me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm always</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in talking to my opponents and</v>

3
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>stayed friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>you know it just so the people I</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree with most strongly,</v>

5
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually quite friendly with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

6
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.890
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't disturb me if they disagree</v>

7
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:39.891
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changes from week to week.</v>

9
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.870
<v Speaker 1>What I've noticed is there's been a</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong increase in skepticism and just</v>

10
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:51.120
<v Speaker 1>in the last couple of weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

11
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it has something to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this snow storms we've been having.</v>

12
00:00:57.331 --> 00:01:02.331
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly I've seen the politicians</v>

13
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>becoming much more skeptical just</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>

14
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>That's across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I welcome that.</v>

15
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.650
<v Speaker 1>I think that that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually means they're recognizing the</v>

16
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:16.824
<v Speaker 1>way things are.</v>

17
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are all sorts of ways.</v>

18
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>It was a couple of farmers in Minnesota</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just reading about who decided to</v>

19
00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:37.591
<v Speaker 1>change from feed lots to grass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there raising beef that there.</v>

20
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.150
<v Speaker 1>These are farmers who are just raising</v>
<v Speaker 1>cows for beef,</v>

21
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>add a certain amount of milk as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they decided to switch from feed</v>

22
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:53.470
<v Speaker 1>lots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is of course the fashionable way</v>

23
00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:57.320
<v Speaker 1>of raising cows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep them on a very crowded feed lot</v>

24
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.480
<v Speaker 1>and feed them on call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're growing corn to feed to the</v>

25
00:02:01.481 --> 00:02:04.090
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of that,</v>

26
00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:09.070
<v Speaker 1>you put them out to grass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you manage the grass in a clever way</v>

27
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 1>with moving fences around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they actually eat the grass much more</v>

28
00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:18.130
<v Speaker 1>evenly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out this pace and,</v>

29
00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:20.260
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

30
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>they're doing extremely well just going</v>
<v Speaker 1>back from feed lots to grass and it has</v>

31
00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:33.661
<v Speaker 1>a big effect on the carbon dioxide in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere in proportion to the area</v>

32
00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:36.070
<v Speaker 1>that they're using.</v>

33
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.880
<v Speaker 1>That means that if the whole of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle West would do this,</v>

34
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.550
<v Speaker 1>it would make a very substantial</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference to the carbon dioxide in the</v>

35
00:02:45.551 --> 00:02:48.010
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that kind of,</v>

36
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.570
<v Speaker 1>that's the sort of practical thing you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do just managing the land more</v>

37
00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>intelligently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

38
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 1>it's rather like building dikes around</v>
<v Speaker 1>new orleans.</v>

39
00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

40
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not all that spectacular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it actually works and</v>

41
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.560
<v Speaker 1>so changing from feed lots to grass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's sort of,</v>

42
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't solve the whole problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it solves a certain chunk of the</v>

43
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>problem and there are other things you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do.</v>

44
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 1>Just doing less plowing makes a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

45
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Plowing is one of the main causes of</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon going into the atmosphere because</v>

46
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>you expose the soil to the atmosphere at</v>
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>

47
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>The carbon gets oxidized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes carbon dioxide and floats off</v>

48
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>into the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you can find without plowing,</v>

49
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.520
<v Speaker 1>it actually helps and doesn't matter how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much coal and oil burning that still</v>

50
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>helps.</v>
