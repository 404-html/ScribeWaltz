1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.540
<v Speaker 1>In Our world view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excellence equals design times,</v>

2
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:06.630
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So half the battle is getting the design</v>

3
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:09.460
<v Speaker 1>of the organization right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.880
<v Speaker 1>these are things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.410
<v Speaker 1>choosing very strategically where to</v>
<v Speaker 1>excel and we're to underperform and that</v>

6
00:00:14.411 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>that's a design function and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that the business model works</v>

7
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>and then it can scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's systematically setting</v>

8
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>people up to perform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other half is,</v>

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>is culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

10
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons that culture matters</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much in service organizations is that</v>

11
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>we need our employees to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 1>every day on the front lines make</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions that are,</v>

13
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>that end up defining the customer</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience in managing those employees.</v>

14
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>The handbook only gets you so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of that is because customers</v>

16
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>are wildly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderfully unpredictable.</v>

17
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>You don't know on the front lines and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the service organization,</v>

18
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:57.591
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen moment to moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and culture tells you what to do where,</v>

19
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there isn't a policy or precedent.</v>

20
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.850
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hugely important asset in service</v>

21
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Southwest Airlines,</v>

22
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.710
<v Speaker 1>the reason we love it is that it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in perhaps the worst industry of</v>

23
00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:14.140
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the industry has essentially</v>

24
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.620
<v Speaker 1>destroyed more value than it's created</v>
<v Speaker 1>since its inception.</v>

25
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.010
<v Speaker 1>And then there's southwest who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>profitable every year,</v>

26
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.640
<v Speaker 1>every year for one decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year for another decade,</v>

27
00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:28.780
<v Speaker 1>every year for another decade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do it by this beautiful elegance of</v>

28
00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:31.660
<v Speaker 1>focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are very comfortable saying,</v>

29
00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:33.490
<v Speaker 1>we do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't do that.</v>

30
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Which means they have great strategy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very great at delivering</v>

31
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:39.070
<v Speaker 1>excellence because they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do these things well,</v>

32
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.110
<v Speaker 1>turnaround time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being on time.</v>

33
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.560
<v Speaker 1>We'll do these things badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go on board of Southwest Airlines flight</v>

34
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.760
<v Speaker 1>and ask someone for a full meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no shame,</v>

35
00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:51.370
<v Speaker 1>no apology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might mock you a little bit in</v>

36
00:01:51.371 --> 00:01:53.920
<v Speaker 1>their reply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They understand what they're optimized</v>

37
00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:54.730
<v Speaker 1>to be great at.</v>

38
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.640
<v Speaker 1>They understand what they have to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in order to deliver on that.</v>

39
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.820
<v Speaker 1>And they understand it from the top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the organization all the way down to the</v>

40
00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that southwest does in</v>

41
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.090
<v Speaker 1>a training experience is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.730
<v Speaker 1>they get everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the new recruits in a room,</v>

43
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.770
<v Speaker 1>and they have everyone stand up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>share their most embarrassing moment.</v>

44
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.390
<v Speaker 1>So people in the moment think this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty hardcore.</v>

45
00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

46
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.740
<v Speaker 1>they're testing us for poise and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to communicate in a stressful</v>

47
00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:28.090
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out southwest isn't looking</v>

48
00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:30.820
<v Speaker 1>at the speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at everyone else and</v>

49
00:02:30.821 --> 00:02:35.821
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for signs of empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when they see signs of empathy in</v>

50
00:02:36.071 --> 00:02:38.020
<v Speaker 1>that crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the people that they ended up</v>

51
00:02:38.021 --> 00:02:39.430
<v Speaker 1>hiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

52
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great example of a distinct</v>

53
00:02:43.271 --> 00:02:46.630
<v Speaker 1>clarity on the values that are important</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them and figuring out how to find</v>

54
00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:47.464
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.230
<v Speaker 1>in the hiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Process excellence is designed times</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

57
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.950
<v Speaker 1>You have to get the design right and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to get the culture right.</v>

58
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Great design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bad Culture won't work.</v>

59
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Great culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad design won't work.</v>

60
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.290
<v Speaker 1>We need both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In southwest is just a magnificent</v>

61
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.610
<v Speaker 1>illustration of both.</v>

62
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
