1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.080
<v Speaker 1>In a nutshell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we take the most useful research from</v>

2
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 1>cognitive science about how the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain reasons and makes decisions and</v>

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.690
<v Speaker 1>the errors that the human brain tends to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make when reasoning or making decisions</v>

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>and we turn that research into workshops</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people can use to apply it to their</v>

5
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>own lives and improve their own decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>making about their health,</v>

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>their finances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their relationships,</v>

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>and the decisions that they make for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first society and the world in general</v>

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>about how to vote and how to treat other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and what they can do to improve</v>

9
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One example of rationality and action,</v>

10
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:36.420
<v Speaker 1>just to give you a sense of what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like and how it's relevant.</v>

11
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Back in 1985,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intel,</v>

12
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a,</v>

13
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>a large foot in the memory chip</v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing business and they'd been</v>

14
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 1>losing money on a memory chips for</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

15
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>So the two co founders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy Grove and Gordon Moore met to</v>

16
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>figure out what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 1>and at one point and he asked what do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think a new CEO would do if the</v>

18
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>board kicked us out and brought in a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>CEO?</v>

19
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>And without hesitating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gordon replied,</v>

20
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would get out of the memory business</v>

21
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.011
<v Speaker 1>and any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

22
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so is there any reason we shouldn't do</v>

23
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>that if we just walk out the door and</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back in and switch out of the</v>

24
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:13.340
<v Speaker 1>memory business?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact that's exactly what they've</v>

25
00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>decided to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a huge success.</v>

26
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is just one example of a</v>

27
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>cognitive bias that appears in lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>contexts and lots of scales called the</v>

28
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 1>commitment effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we stick with a business plan or a</v>

29
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>career or relationship long after it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>become quite clear that it's not doing</v>

30
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>anything for us or that it's actively</v>
<v Speaker 1>destructive or self destructive because</v>

31
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>we have an irrational commitment to</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever we have been doing for a awhile</v>

32
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.950
<v Speaker 1>because we don't like the idea of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>past investments having gone to waste or</v>

33
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>because it's become part of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>

34
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>And the technique that Andy and Gordon</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to snap themselves out of the</v>

35
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:49.950
<v Speaker 1>commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is also a really generally</v>

36
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>useful technique called looking at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem as if you were an outsider,</v>

37
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:56.190
<v Speaker 1>an outside party over the past few</v>
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>

38
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Cognitive scientists have learned a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this and many other biases that</v>

39
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>human brains are subject to when we try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make decisions,</v>

40
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Speaker 1>but fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive science has also learned a lot</v>

41
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.760
<v Speaker 1>about things that we can do to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the center for applied</v>

42
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're taking that research,</v>

43
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>teaching people about the biases where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they occur,</v>

44
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.470
<v Speaker 1>when we're vulnerable to biases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then teaching them simple and easy</v>

45
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:20.700
<v Speaker 1>mental habits like looking at a problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if you're an outsider to overcome</v>

46
00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>those biases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rationality also is a significant public</v>

47
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:26.520
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the main motivations</v>

48
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>behind the founding of CFR.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Society would look very different if</v>

49
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 1>rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational thinking and decision making</v>

50
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 1>more widespread just to name a few of</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

51
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>many things that I could name.</v>

52
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 1>We as a society would demand evidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>from politicians for the claims that</v>

53
00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>they made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would notice when politicians were</v>

54
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.370
<v Speaker 1>misdirecting us by playing on our</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>

55
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.210
<v Speaker 1>we would be less vulnerable to prejudice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stereotypes.</v>

56
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we would be wary of the</v>

57
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very universal bias in which</v>

58
00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:59.160
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look for examples,</v>

59
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>fit a stereotype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't look for examples that</v>

60
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>don't fit the stereotypes you ended up</v>
<v Speaker 1>confirming and reinforcing a stereotype</v>

61
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 1>in your minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would spend our money much more</v>

62
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>effectively as a society to stave off</v>
<v Speaker 1>important risks.</v>

63
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.220
<v Speaker 1>The fact that things like terrorism and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

64
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.370
<v Speaker 1>crimes like abduction are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>so vividly portrayed on the news makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>them a much more salient and makes us</v>

66
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>overweight those risks the same way we</v>
<v Speaker 1>overweight any kind of evidence.</v>

67
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>It's particularly vivid or salient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

68
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>even if it isn't actually the best bang</v>
<v Speaker 1>for our buck in terms of risk reduction.</v>
