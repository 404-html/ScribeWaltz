WEBVTT

1
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Religiously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to believe people are</v>

2
00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:16.010
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are a,</v>

4
00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I think people are fundamentally good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And B,</v>

5
00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:23.890
<v Speaker 1>I think people are fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.300
<v Speaker 1>humorous and people fundamentally want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to laugh.</v>

7
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.020
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone is not laughing,</v>

8
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.320
<v Speaker 1>that's the exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's perversion because I think you</v>

9
00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:37.840
<v Speaker 1>can be turned from someone who likes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh to someone who doesn't.</v>

10
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.540
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's almost impossible to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other way.</v>

11
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't think no one's ever met a</v>
<v Speaker 1>humorless person who became a funny one.</v>

12
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can learn the form and whatever,</v>

14
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.830
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you could even learn the form</v>
<v Speaker 1>so well that you can fool most people.</v>

15
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.930
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't be able to fool the</v>
<v Speaker 1>genuinely funny people,</v>

16
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>boredom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think also just the,</v>

17
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's such an intense psychic pain</v>

18
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:20.790
<v Speaker 1>just being alive and all this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>going down on,</v>

19
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>around you and on top of you and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffocating.</v>

20
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humor is released.</v>

21
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.663
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

22
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>it is joyful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

23
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.890
<v Speaker 1>it's like sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can have it more often.</v>

24
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

25
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like cheap sex.</v>

26
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

27
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.920
<v Speaker 1>you can do it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

28
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.943
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

29
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that it's sort of a cliche.</v>

30
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 1>They have a funny rabbi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>every rabbi thinks he's pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

32
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least they do nowadays.</v>

33
00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>And the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they thought they were pretty</v>

34
00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

35
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

36
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>I could wax philosophical and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

37
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>comedy and religion or about some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of aspiration or something higher or do</v>

39
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to elevate us?</v>

40
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>And when we laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>our souls become bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think so.</v>

42
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

43
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.900
<v Speaker 1>I think rabbis are smart people and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think smart people tend to be funny.</v>

44
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:25.110
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's the connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

45
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 1>I should have been drinking coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

46
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't if there's any connection</v>

47
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

48
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there must be some connection</v>

49
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>between religion and comedy because a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while,</v>

50
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.520
<v Speaker 1>because the people I know in comedy are</v>
<v Speaker 1>either pretty religious or,</v>

51
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 1>and that's the minority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is there a swing the other way</v>

52
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>completely and are rabidly atheistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

53
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

54
00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:57.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some emotional switch that gets</v>

55
00:02:57.661 --> 00:02:58.530
<v Speaker 1>clicked on either way.</v>

56
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

57
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot more self aware than they</v>

58
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The audience as a lot more self aware</v>

59
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.873
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not just making jokes necessarily</v>

62
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're making jokes on jokes and your</v>

63
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>jokes have reference to other jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

64
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might have been in the old days,</v>

65
00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>the only other people in the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>business would know these things.</v>

66
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:29.611
<v Speaker 1>But now everyone's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got such a vast cultural,</v>

67
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>backlog on DVD and everything that</v>

68
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every Monte Python sketch and everyone</v>

69
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>knows this and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

70
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're all kind of,</v>

71
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 1>we and the audience are making</v>
<v Speaker 1>references to,</v>

72
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

73
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and winking at them from things that are</v>

74
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:46.670
<v Speaker 1>40 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that said,</v>

75
00:03:46.671 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and comedy probably,</v>

76
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't changed as much as we think it</v>
<v Speaker 1>has either.</v>

77
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.060
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

78
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.821
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can say,</v>

79
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we all have that reference point,</v>

80
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably an a in a small way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that big a deal.</v>

81
00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:58.090
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

82
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.953
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

83
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.710
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

84
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question because I,</v>

85
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.110
<v Speaker 1>I would say we still laugh at slapstick</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

86
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.310
<v Speaker 1>but we don't as much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:04:10.311 --> 00:04:12.470
<v Speaker 1>and it would be very hard for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

88
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get away with something as like,</v>

89
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.360
<v Speaker 1>it's primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like an early sixties Jerry Lewis</v>

90
00:04:20.361 --> 00:04:21.500
<v Speaker 1>movie right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

91
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the kids aren't laughing at that</v>

92
00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:26.180
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got Mr. Bean like,</v>

93
00:04:26.181 --> 00:04:27.890
<v Speaker 1>and that's nice and that's nice slap</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick and,</v>

94
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems more sophisticated,</v>

95
00:04:30.981 --> 00:04:31.680
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

96
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.580
<v Speaker 1>that I might just be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's more modern style.</v>

97
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it used to be,</v>

98
00:04:37.011 --> 00:04:39.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he lived in a village and didn't have</v>

99
00:04:39.351 --> 00:04:42.080
<v Speaker 1>tv and a clown came through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that it was the funniest God,</v>

100
00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:43.550
<v Speaker 1>anything you'd ever seen in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

101
00:04:43.551 --> 00:04:46.100
<v Speaker 1>he'd be fell on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but amazing.</v>

102
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>If you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.930
<v Speaker 1>eight hours of TV every day and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>see amazing,</v>

104
00:04:51.931 --> 00:04:54.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see Marcel Marceau and you can</v>

105
00:04:54.201 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

106
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Lenny Bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can see whatever,</v>

107
00:04:56.751 --> 00:04:57.584
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

108
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.850
<v Speaker 1>the exposure makes you more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a critic.</v>

109
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've only been peanut butter and</v>

110
00:05:04.521 --> 00:05:06.800
<v Speaker 1>jelly sandwiches all your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think those are pretty great.</v>

111
00:05:06.801 --> 00:05:08.630
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you taste the caviar,</v>

112
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.370
<v Speaker 1>forget about peanut butter.</v>

113
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an awful lot of it being</v>

114
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:17.330
<v Speaker 1>produced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

115
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I think what we're doing now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.960
<v Speaker 1>is an area where we're going to see a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of comedy produced just in smaller,</v>

117
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just with the Internet,</v>

118
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the power of giving the people just</v>

119
00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>to produce things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

120
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to see things on youtube,</v>

121
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to see if people have a</v>

122
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:40.960
<v Speaker 1>funny idea and shoot it on their dv</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera and get it out there that</v>

123
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

124
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.853
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

125
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.020
<v Speaker 1>But people are always also going to want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see bigger,</v>

126
00:05:48.021 --> 00:05:49.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more expensive things.</v>

127
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.140
<v Speaker 1>They're always gonna want to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitcoms,</v>

128
00:05:51.141 --> 00:05:56.141
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a big funny movies that you wanna see</v>

129
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 1>something nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.361
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

131
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a funny video that guy made,</v>

132
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.850
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I want to,</v>

133
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.590
<v Speaker 1>I want a compelling story to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.670
<v Speaker 1>people like stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>

135
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.920
<v Speaker 1>we've always liked stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

136
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

137
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:12.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think comedy is going to change</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

138
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.160
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>

139
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the forum comedy takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be all that different</v>

140
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.560
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

141
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:20.511
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know which way the world's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go,</v>

143
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:23.230
<v Speaker 1>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.860
<v Speaker 1>the world gets darker than the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>will probably become darker,</v>

145
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.980
<v Speaker 1>more violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

146
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.620
<v Speaker 1>we might be seeing some of that now.</v>

147
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.653
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

148
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

149
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>I tend not to watch any comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise it would be my whole life.</v>

150
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

151
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so critical.</v>

152
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible just to watch anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>and enjoy it,</v>

153
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.260
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

154
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 1>I tend to keep away from it as much as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

155
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

156
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.320
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

157
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it's changing it for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's changing it.</v>

158
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.960
<v Speaker 1>There's really no telling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

159
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:05.570
<v Speaker 1>it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to be able to have a DVD of</v>

160
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:06.680
<v Speaker 1>funny stuff and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.730
<v Speaker 1>it's nice to be able to go on Youtube</v>
<v Speaker 1>and watch the funny guys.</v>

162
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

163
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.980
<v Speaker 1>I saw these 20 guys doing a David Blaine</v>
<v Speaker 1>impression the other day.</v>

164
00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:17.380
<v Speaker 1>That was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

165
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I got to watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

166
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:19.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to see it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's out there that are Kelly</v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped in the closet.</v>

168
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Like that's all great stuff and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

169
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.960
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's all for the good.</v>

170
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

171
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.260
<v Speaker 1>it isn't strictly about computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

172
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:34.420
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a visual agent,</v>

173
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.270
<v Speaker 1>no written comedy is nonexistent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

174
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of pages in the front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the New Yorker and that's really it.</v>

175
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.670
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

176
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.350
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty to read if you want to.</v>

177
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I can certainly make fun of my people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

178
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 1>and other Cantu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

179
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.480
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm a nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think as a Jew is sort of a</v>

180
00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:06.350
<v Speaker 1>specific case because there are a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish writers and we tend to go to the</v>

181
00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:07.101
<v Speaker 1>Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

182
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 1>a lot in comedy and bounced that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really easy.</v>

183
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:14.720
<v Speaker 1>And I don't love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a little too easy.</v>

184
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.870
<v Speaker 1>ethnically at El,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll find a lot of copywriters</v>

186
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.170
<v Speaker 1>are Jewish and a lot her Irish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

187
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.000
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure why those two streams sort</v>

188
00:08:23.001 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 1>of came together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

189
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:24.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

190
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tend to get along so it's nice.</v>

191
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can</v>

192
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.600
<v Speaker 1>I think some Jewish jokes are very funny</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think others are,</v>

193
00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:36.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just at,</v>

194
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.290
<v Speaker 1>or just it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just saying the word Jew and expecting a</v>

195
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:40.101
<v Speaker 1>laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

196
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:41.060
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

197
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 1>that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At first the other ethnicities go,</v>

198
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like anything should be out</v>

199
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:47.900
<v Speaker 1>of bounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.773
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

201
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm stridently,</v>

202
00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:54.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>First Amendment,</v>

203
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 1>struggling second amendment to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like all those amendments,</v>

204
00:08:57.121 --> 00:08:59.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

205
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then again,</v>

206
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.890
<v Speaker 1>that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say something offensive,</v>

207
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can expect to get your ass kicked.</v>

208
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should have the right to say it</v>

209
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:09.804
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

210
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.690
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone self sensors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

211
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:16.850
<v Speaker 1>you think awful things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

212
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're thinking the awful</v>
<v Speaker 1>things right now,</v>

213
00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:20.390
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all think terrible,</v>

214
00:09:20.391 --> 00:09:21.440
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible things.</v>

215
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so sometimes the terrible things,</v>

216
00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:30.140
<v Speaker 1>I think our jokes and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't always say this out loud.</v>

217
00:09:30.141 --> 00:09:35.141
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably self censor a lot less than a</v>

218
00:09:35.571 --> 00:09:39.380
<v Speaker 1>lot of people and I have certainly said</v>
<v Speaker 1>some terrible things,</v>

219
00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.320
<v Speaker 1>which I regret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

220
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.653
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

221
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.010
<v Speaker 1>I can't say I think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

222
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.900
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

223
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.470
<v Speaker 1>I would ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

224
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.370
<v Speaker 1>or I'd ask anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

225
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.970
<v Speaker 1>does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it easier for them to self censor?</v>

226
00:09:54.971 --> 00:09:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

227
00:09:56.051 --> 00:09:56.360
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

228
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.620
<v Speaker 1>you walk around saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm censoring myself right now.</v>

229
00:09:59.621 --> 00:10:00.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

230
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.500
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

231
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:07.000
<v Speaker 1>you aren't telling every beautiful woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much you would like to have sex with</v>

232
00:10:07.001 --> 00:10:08.440
<v Speaker 1>her reverie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attractive man.</v>

233
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.233
<v Speaker 1>The same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

234
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.460
<v Speaker 1>if you find both of them equally</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive,</v>

235
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

236
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.600
<v Speaker 1>it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it become easier to sell.</v>

237
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess when you were a kid,</v>

238
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say anything you want.</v>

239
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an adult now.</v>

240
00:10:21.491 --> 00:10:22.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

241
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.950
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's not any different for a</v>

242
00:10:26.951 --> 00:10:29.770
<v Speaker 1>comedy writer or a writer in general</v>
<v Speaker 1>than it is for anyone else.</v>

243
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.860
<v Speaker 1>I think we are afforded more freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I don't,</v>

244
00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't think writers and Comedians</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to censor as much.</v>

245
00:10:35.741 --> 00:10:37.210
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.550
<v Speaker 1>we're given that latitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to use it that level.</v>

247
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.300
<v Speaker 1>We have it.</v>

248
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:41.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
