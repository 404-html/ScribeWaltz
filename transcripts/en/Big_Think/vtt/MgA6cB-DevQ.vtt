1
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>So a</v>

2
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.083
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.720
<v Speaker 1>what triggers a panic attack is,</v>

4
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.163
<v Speaker 2>hm,</v>

5
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm hesitating because there's sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>two main models of this.</v>

6
00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:27.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is that I guess the both of them</v>

7
00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:29.650
<v Speaker 1>center on the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.940
<v Speaker 1>that everyone is capable of having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>panic attack you for it.</v>

9
00:00:33.941 --> 00:00:37.140
<v Speaker 1>If a tiger suddenly ran into the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would probably have a tie,</v>

10
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.170
<v Speaker 1>a panic attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that we have the brain</v>

11
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:46.171
<v Speaker 1>circuitry to have a panic attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that that,</v>

12
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.080
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the circuitry is meant to be</v>

13
00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:55.081
<v Speaker 1>triggered by actual immediate danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people who have clinical panic</v>

14
00:00:57.281 --> 00:01:00.790
<v Speaker 1>attacks have those attacks without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>when there is no real danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what we think is that this,</v>

16
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trigger is,</v>

17
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is more easily set off so to speak.</v>

18
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sets it off?</v>

19
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

20
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.390
<v Speaker 1>it can almost be like a loose wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could think of it as a loose wire in</v>

21
00:01:16.391 --> 00:01:18.160
<v Speaker 1>your fire alarm system or something.</v>

22
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.700
<v Speaker 1>So it can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it can just just set off.</v>

23
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.210
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times there's a lot of evidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what triggers a panic attack is a,</v>

25
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>an actual bodily sensation of the sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have when you have anxiety.</v>

26
00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:38.410
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about adrenaline rush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have heart palpitations,</v>

27
00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:41.440
<v Speaker 1>you get a little short of breath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel a little shaky,</v>

28
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 1>sweaty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of those kinds of feelings,</v>

29
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can trigger it kind of,</v>

30
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we call catastrophic</v>

31
00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:53.830
<v Speaker 1>misinterpretations on the part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person who's prone to having panic</v>

32
00:01:53.831 --> 00:01:54.880
<v Speaker 1>attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that there,</v>

33
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>what we know about such people is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're</v>

34
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.210
<v Speaker 1>more sensitive than the rest of us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bodily sensations to start with.</v>

35
00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:04.961
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:06.280
<v Speaker 1>if you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

37
00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:09.580
<v Speaker 1>panic attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would be better able to tell me</v>

38
00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:12.430
<v Speaker 1>right now what your heart rate is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I would be able to tell you.</v>

39
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.640
<v Speaker 1>And so there's that sensitivity start</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

40
00:02:15.641 --> 00:02:19.300
<v Speaker 1>and then then something starts your</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart racing.</v>

41
00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:21.580
<v Speaker 1>And that could be running up a flight of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stairs.</v>

42
00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:24.430
<v Speaker 1>It could be I'm drinking a cup of</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

43
00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:27.010
<v Speaker 1>It could be getting mad at someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:27.011 --> 00:02:29.830
<v Speaker 1>any of those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your heart starts to race and all of a</v>

45
00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:34.630
<v Speaker 1>sudden you sense that pretty early on</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it starts to beat faster and all of</v>

46
00:02:34.631 --> 00:02:39.631
<v Speaker 1>a sudden you are feeling it and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think your mind automatically thinks</v>

47
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.900
<v Speaker 1>something terrible's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something very dangerous is happening</v>

48
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.500
<v Speaker 1>within your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be having,</v>

49
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.640
<v Speaker 1>he might think you're having a heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack or a stroke or some such thing.</v>

50
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.310
<v Speaker 1>And so that is frightening in itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

51
00:02:51.311 --> 00:02:56.311
<v Speaker 1>So then that triggers more fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more bodily sensations in your</v>

52
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.413
<v Speaker 1>continuing.</v>

53
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.571
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

54
00:03:02.571 --> 00:03:03.231
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:03:03.231 --> 00:03:08.231
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the treatments that we do that have</v>

56
00:03:08.541 --> 00:03:13.541
<v Speaker 1>been proven to be helpful for people</v>
<v Speaker 1>center on kind of desensitize.</v>

57
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.200
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you have a phobia of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own bodily sensations.</v>

58
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.590
<v Speaker 1>So you know how we work with phobias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were afraid of cats,</v>

59
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm someone who's afraid of cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We put them in front of cats,</v>

60
00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:26.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that they essentially learn.</v>

61
00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:29.240
<v Speaker 1>The cats really aren't that dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

62
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 1>and so we follow that same principle</v>
<v Speaker 1>with panic attacks and we evoke bodily</v>

63
00:03:34.761 --> 00:03:35.600
<v Speaker 1>sensations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

64
00:03:35.601 --> 00:03:36.434
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

65
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might have someone run in place in</v>

66
00:03:38.331 --> 00:03:41.850
<v Speaker 1>the office and their heart starts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>race and then they see that they're,</v>

67
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a normal reaction to running in</v>

68
00:03:44.211 --> 00:03:44.990
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

69
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

70
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.560
<v Speaker 1>we're sort of there with them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>helping them with that and we basically</v>

71
00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:51.350
<v Speaker 1>desensitize them and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

72
00:03:51.351 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 1>and teach them also what is behind a</v>
<v Speaker 1>panic attack?</v>

73
00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.213
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

75
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.960
<v Speaker 1>that's a question that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good question because</v>

76
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.260
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're grappling with right</v>
<v Speaker 1>this minute in the new diagnostic system</v>

77
00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:10.980
<v Speaker 1>that's being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:12.960
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every so often we rewrite the</v>

79
00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:16.710
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric diagnostic system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the big questions is,</v>

80
00:04:16.711 --> 00:04:20.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we be looking at anxiety and mood</v>

81
00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:21.180
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

82
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other kinds of psychological problems on</v>

83
00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:27.390
<v Speaker 1>a dimensional scale like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

84
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if so,</v>

85
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.110
<v Speaker 1>where's the cutoff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

86
00:04:31.111 --> 00:04:34.110
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's probably not just in one</v>

87
00:04:34.111 --> 00:04:36.450
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the skills that I've developed,</v>

88
00:04:36.451 --> 00:04:41.220
<v Speaker 1>where are ones that are focused very</v>
<v Speaker 1>much so on diagnoses that we already</v>

89
00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:42.810
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there,</v>

90
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cutoff is,</v>

91
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.500
<v Speaker 1>is based basically determined by when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can diagnose panic disorder for example,</v>

92
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:54.060
<v Speaker 1>of the panic disorder severity scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can say that,</v>

93
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you a number,</v>

94
00:04:55.951 --> 00:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a number that corresponds to the</v>

95
00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:00.690
<v Speaker 1>best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

96
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.000
<v Speaker 1>kind of indicator that someone will have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a diagnosis of panic disorder.</v>

97
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.030
<v Speaker 1>So that's how we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

98
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is the,</v>

99
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.960
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely true that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension,</v>

100
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these symptoms occur in a dimensional</v>

101
00:05:16.771 --> 00:05:18.670
<v Speaker 1>way such that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

102
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.400
<v Speaker 1>there certainly there's normal anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

103
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.500
<v Speaker 1>and there's normal panic even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though so panics different from</v>

104
00:05:25.501 --> 00:05:28.320
<v Speaker 1>anxiety because panic is an immediate</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear reaction,</v>

105
00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:30.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas anxiety is more something we</v>

106
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:34.710
<v Speaker 1>think is going to happen in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So panic occurs when you think,</v>

107
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:36.510
<v Speaker 1>like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a tiger in the room,</v>

108
00:05:36.511 --> 00:05:39.540
<v Speaker 1>someone's pointing a gun at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that looks like it's the</v>

109
00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:41.910
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the immediate future as opposed</v>

110
00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:42.930
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111
00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm anxious about a test I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to take next week or something.</v>
