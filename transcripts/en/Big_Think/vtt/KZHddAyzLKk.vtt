00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had been on the same page on</v>

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>immigration reform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our Democratic Caucus has adopted</v>

3
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.410
<v Speaker 1>certain principles that relate to</v>
<v Speaker 1>securing our borders and enforcing our</v>

4
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:20.310
<v Speaker 1>laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting our workers,</v>

5
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>unifying families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having a path to legalization.</v>

6
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.340
<v Speaker 1>And they were the principles that we had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been arguing from debating from,</v>

7
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for several years now.</v>

8
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.530
<v Speaker 1>So I would hope that any comprehensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration reform that we would have a</v>

9
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>would contain those principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also recognize that immigration is</v>

10
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>essential to our competitiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need all the fresh,</v>

11
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>wonderful thinking from all over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world to be part of our economy.</v>

12
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>And we also need many of the young</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have been educated in our</v>

13
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>institutions of higher learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the sciences to stay here.</v>

14
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.360
<v Speaker 1>So a short of a comprehensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration reform at or part of it.</v>

15
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.650
<v Speaker 1>We'd like to see a green card stapled to</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

16
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.940
<v Speaker 1>a graduate degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that regard.</v>

17
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate the question because I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>said to the president and to my</v>

18
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>colleagues and to all who will listen is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we will not be in a position to</v>

19
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>have the comprehensive immigration</v>
<v Speaker 1>reform that we want unless we enlarge</v>

20
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.600
<v Speaker 1>the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people are concerned in our country</v>

21
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>is that their job security and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think they're losing their job because</v>

22
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:38.151
<v Speaker 1>of trade or because of immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So until we have progressive economic</v>

23
00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>agenda creating good paying jobs in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

24
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>people have more sense of security</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

25
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we won't be able to have the immigration</v>

26
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>reform that is necessary and worthy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subject that we are addressing.</v>

27
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe the foundation has to be laid</v>

28
00:01:56.881 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>by a strong economic job producing job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating business,</v>

29
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:06.471
<v Speaker 1>creating a agenda for America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we can go to the next step.</v>
