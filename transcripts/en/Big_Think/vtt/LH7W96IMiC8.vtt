00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president should lead,</v>

2
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have individual states and</v>

3
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>individual movements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.140
<v Speaker 1>deciding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.230
<v Speaker 1>issues affecting the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A president has to set it,</v>

6
00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now when it comes to abortion,</v>

7
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I believe that in a woman's right to</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose.</v>

8
00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>But as president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do everything I can to stop</v>

9
00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:31.790
<v Speaker 1>unwanted pregnancies to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to push for a adoption and sex education</v>

10
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:33.550
<v Speaker 1>and family planning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

11
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.810
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.620
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to gay rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we should be a country that</v>

13
00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:42.830
<v Speaker 1>honors the fact that we shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminate on the basis of race,</v>

14
00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:46.000
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual orientation as a Gobbler,</v>

15
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our red state,</v>

16
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which a conservative state I had fought.</v>

17
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.380
<v Speaker 1>I have fought against those that want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminate against the gays.</v>

18
00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:59.381
<v Speaker 1>And I have got the most gay pro gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>lesbian record in the country.</v>

19
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Not because it's politically popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

20
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a very conservative state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because it's the right thing to do,</v>

21
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.020
<v Speaker 1>I would try to lead in those areas as</v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

22
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Not imposed my will but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but take strong moral stands.</v>

23
00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Those are value stands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

24
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.710
<v Speaker 1>we should be a nation of values and</v>
<v Speaker 1>values are not just a religious values.</v>

25
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Other values that we should emphasize is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right to have healthcare,</v>

26
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 1>the right for a child to be able to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to school,</v>

27
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.200
<v Speaker 1>the right for anybody to pursue the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American dream.</v>

28
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>So I would expand the definition of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes value.</v>
