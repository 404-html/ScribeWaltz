1
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Joanne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing poetry as being down on your</v>

2
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>hands and knees with the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone carbs a swans and animals out</v>

4
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:17.420
<v Speaker 1>of soap and that person loves soap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you right,</v>

5
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.380
<v Speaker 1>you love the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an opportunity.</v>

6
00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Writing a poem is an opportunity to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>as close to the language has pretty much</v>

7
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.070
<v Speaker 1>the other joy because it is a pleasure</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

9
00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no high mission that drives me to</v>

10
00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>write poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a very hedonistic activity and I</v>

11
00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:40.100
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write it for pleasure,</v>

12
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.810
<v Speaker 1>I go there to get pleasure and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if possible to give pleasure.</v>

13
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

14
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the key pleasures is,</v>

15
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.690
<v Speaker 1>and most poets would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

16
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>would agree with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starting out not knowing where you're</v>

17
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:58.391
<v Speaker 1>going and finding a way to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the poem becomes</v>

18
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.960
<v Speaker 1>not a whole expression of something you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think or feel,</v>

19
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>but it becomes a journey through itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>to an ending.</v>

20
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.430
<v Speaker 1>And that ending is a unforeseeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

21
00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:17.270
<v Speaker 1>the ending is something that the poem is</v>
<v Speaker 1>busy creating.</v>

22
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.370
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if the poem is the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to access that.</v>

23
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.130
<v Speaker 1>That particular ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

24
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.320
<v Speaker 1>I have a poem called questions about</v>
<v Speaker 1>angels.</v>

25
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of that poem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.750
<v Speaker 1>an angel appears and I didn't know she</v>
<v Speaker 1>existed before I write that wrote that</v>

27
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:38.480
<v Speaker 1>poem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess strictly speaking she</v>

28
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:42.170
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think of that poem is simply the</v>

29
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:44.360
<v Speaker 1>job of that poem is to bring her into</v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

30
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:47.600
<v Speaker 1>to bring its own ending into being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're not writing,</v>

31
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.510
<v Speaker 1>there's an anxiety about whether you</v>
<v Speaker 1>will right again,</v>

32
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the kinds of writers,</v>

33
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least compared to playwrights and</v>

34
00:01:57.111 --> 00:02:01.610
<v Speaker 1>novelists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poets return to the blank page more</v>

35
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:03.710
<v Speaker 1>frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.500
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a novel can take you six months or five</v>

37
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.480
<v Speaker 1>years to write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a poem,</v>

38
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get done in an afternoon or a couple</v>

39
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:12.560
<v Speaker 1>of days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.360
<v Speaker 1>and then you're back to zero and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to restart from nothing.</v>

41
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.850
<v Speaker 1>And at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question comes up.</v>

42
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you restart?</v>

43
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Can you boot yourself up again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak?</v>

44
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Or was that ed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

45
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.370
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is probably the main anxiety I</v>

46
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:35.170
<v Speaker 1>think that goes with poetry writing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

47
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.740
<v Speaker 1>heavier exposure to the blank page or</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular,</v>

48
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>encounters with blankness.</v>

49
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.190
<v Speaker 1>I just go poem by poem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have an overarching,</v>

50
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of a book as a project.</v>

51
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.320
<v Speaker 1>I probably have a manuscript.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do have a manuscript of foams that is</v>

52
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.280
<v Speaker 1>just about ready and I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to send it out too early.</v>

53
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>It probably needs maybe two or three at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>

54
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really strong,</v>

55
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>good poems and that it will be ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm just interested in getting</v>

56
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:15.031
<v Speaker 1>that out of the house and maybe starting</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon this afternoon or our next</v>

57
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

58
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
