00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Hi there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Jason Guts and you're listening to</v>

2
00:00:02.621 --> 00:00:04.680
<v Speaker 1>think again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big thing podcast</v>

3
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 1>since 2008 big thing has been sharing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big ideas in little doses from some</v>

4
00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:19.480
<v Speaker 1>of the most creative thinkers around on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing against podcast.</v>

5
00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:21.400
<v Speaker 1>We take ourselves out of our comfort</v>
<v Speaker 1>zone.</v>

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Surprising my guests and me are hosts</v>
<v Speaker 1>with unexpected interview clips from big</v>

7
00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:28.600
<v Speaker 1>thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archives,</v>

8
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that we didn't necessarily come</v>

9
00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>here prepared to discuss today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy to be joined by Professor</v>

10
00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:39.781
<v Speaker 1>Eric Kandel of Columbia University in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the year 2000 he won the Nobel prize in</v>

11
00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:44.110
<v Speaker 1>physiology or medicine for pioneering</v>
<v Speaker 1>work on understanding how memory is</v>

12
00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:48.100
<v Speaker 1>stored in the brain by studying a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular type of sea snail with a</v>

13
00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:51.100
<v Speaker 1>relatively simple nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In his recent books,</v>

14
00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:55.510
<v Speaker 1>he's been pioneering in a very different</v>
<v Speaker 1>way trying to bridge the gap between the</v>

15
00:00:55.511 --> 00:00:58.630
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote two cultures of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sciences and the humanities.</v>

16
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.560
<v Speaker 1>His current book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reductionism in art and brain science</v>

17
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>continues this word looking at the ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>both modern art and science reduced</v>

18
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:12.190
<v Speaker 1>complex phenomena down into their</v>
<v Speaker 1>component parts to achieve new insights</v>

19
00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>and effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to think again.</v>

20
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Professor Kendall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

21
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe we should start with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural divide between the humanities</v>

22
00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:24.430
<v Speaker 1>and the sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a very big topic,</v>

23
00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:29.080
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you want to start with a bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an overview of how that happened.</v>

24
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.980
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this was in the late 1950</v>

25
00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:37.981
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and early 1960s CP snow</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a series of give a series of</v>

26
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 2>lectures and motor series of essays on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the divide between the humanities and</v>

27
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Speaker 2>the sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought that this was an bridgeable</v>

28
00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:51.771
<v Speaker 2>divide because humanists and scientists</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not only had different aspirations,</v>

29
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 2>different goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but use different methodologies.</v>

30
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 2>And the point that I tried to make in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this book,</v>

31
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:03.921
<v Speaker 2>the overriding theme is that humanistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>aspirations are not unique to people who</v>

32
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 2>called humanists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but scientists can also have humanistic</v>

33
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:12.030
<v Speaker 2>aspirations and all in modesty I can say</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

34
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.700
<v Speaker 2>the study of learning and memory is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanistic idea.</v>

35
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 2>We all want to understand who we are</v>
<v Speaker 2>because who we are is in large part</v>

36
00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:24.141
<v Speaker 2>dependent on what we remember about</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves and that has a biological</v>

37
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 2>base,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biological basis memory.</v>

38
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.590
<v Speaker 2>In addition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only do scientists have humanistic</v>

39
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 2>goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but artists use empirical scientific</v>

40
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:40.890
<v Speaker 2>experimental methods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my book shows several examples of</v>

41
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jackson pollock taking the canvas off</v>

42
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 2>the wall and putting it on the floor and</v>
<v Speaker 2>flipping on it.</v>

43
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 2>This is a completely new approach to</v>
<v Speaker 2>painting,</v>

44
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could give it a little,</v>

45
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.760
<v Speaker 1>a brief overview of what what you mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>by reductionism because the term has</v>

46
00:02:57.221 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>many meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them pejorative,</v>

47
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>you're not using it in that way here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you could talk about what</v>

48
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>reductionism is and how it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>broadly it's common to art and science,</v>

50
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reduction is a miss taking a complex</v>

51
00:03:10.191 --> 00:03:15.191
<v Speaker 2>problem that interests you and taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>one component of that problem and going</v>

52
00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:18.710
<v Speaker 2>into the great depth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

53
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.690
<v Speaker 2>on the cover of my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an image by Rothko who's a color</v>

54
00:03:23.691 --> 00:03:28.691
<v Speaker 2>field painter and he's decided that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>can convey emotions most effectively by</v>

55
00:03:31.221 --> 00:03:35.060
<v Speaker 2>using color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he uses stripes of color in many of</v>

56
00:03:35.061 --> 00:03:38.870
<v Speaker 2>his paintings to convey a feeling that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost spiritual.</v>

57
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.110
<v Speaker 2>And as he aged and also became more</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed,</v>

58
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.650
<v Speaker 2>the colors change became darker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Rothko Chapel,</v>

59
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.390
<v Speaker 2>they're dark browns and blacks and silly</v>
<v Speaker 2>conveys a powerful mood in this way.</v>

60
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.340
<v Speaker 2>So this clearly is a reductionist</v>
<v Speaker 2>approach.</v>

61
00:03:52.341 --> 00:03:55.580
<v Speaker 2>He has a chance of doing many things</v>
<v Speaker 2>besides colors,</v>

62
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.800
<v Speaker 2>pick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use figuration and addition color,</v>

63
00:03:57.801 --> 00:04:00.920
<v Speaker 2>but it drops out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Figuration focuses only on color and</v>

64
00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:05.660
<v Speaker 2>simplifies the color pattern and yet we</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a powerful response to it.</v>

65
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.380
<v Speaker 1>And this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

66
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.350
<v Speaker 1>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way I'm thinking about it,</v>

67
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.620
<v Speaker 1>the goal of reductionism in science at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least as you describe it in the book</v>

68
00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:19.830
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm using the example of your work with</v>

69
00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:22.680
<v Speaker 1>sea snails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you are trying to understand</v>

70
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:27.681
<v Speaker 1>the complex phenomenon of memory by</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at a relatively simple nervous</v>

71
00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:32.280
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your goal is to understand that</v>

72
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:35.850
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the artists that you describe</v>

73
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.060
<v Speaker 1>what they're trying to do seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>less about understanding maybe then</v>

74
00:04:41.701 --> 00:04:46.701
<v Speaker 1>about getting at some more immediate</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience or provoking some kind of</v>

75
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.410
<v Speaker 1>response in themselves or in the viewer</v>
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>

76
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.590
<v Speaker 1>could you speak to that a bit?</v>

77
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.401
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>

78
00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:58.401
<v Speaker 2>you described it perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reductionism need not simply solve a</v>

79
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 2>scientific problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although in a sense every artist's</v>

80
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 2>solves scientific problems along the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

81
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.270
<v Speaker 2>But it may be that of the range of</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional experiences.</v>

82
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 2>The artists were only focused on some</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than others in order to go into</v>

83
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 2>it in some depth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

84
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:21.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean the history of art from Giotto to</v>
<v Speaker 2>1852 claude monet was figuration,</v>

85
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.800
<v Speaker 2>the whole idea of art was to deceive the</v>
<v Speaker 2>viewer and to thinking that when they</v>

86
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 2>were looking at a flat surface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were in fact seeing a three</v>

87
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:37.231
<v Speaker 2>dimensional world and the whole autistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>capability critically involved trying to</v>

88
00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:40.450
<v Speaker 2>develop perspectives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

89
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 2>That gives you the sense of three</v>
<v Speaker 2>dimensionality,</v>

90
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.750
<v Speaker 2>modern arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reduce that.</v>

91
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Why not accept the fact that we work on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a flat surface and let's do the most we</v>

92
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:54.550
<v Speaker 2>can with a flat surface and bring out</v>
<v Speaker 2>new stuff.</v>

93
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>And what they're driving at though as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you it in the book,</v>

94
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:01.490
<v Speaker 1>and you quote a number of these artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they seem to be driving at most of</v>

95
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:06.491
<v Speaker 1>them is trying to get a more immediate</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of the sublime but,</v>

96
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.250
<v Speaker 1>but not to demystify it in any way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wonder whether that's sort of the</v>

97
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 1>heart of this cultural divide sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the arts,</v>

98
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 1>the humanities and the sciences that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

99
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:21.820
<v Speaker 1>science seeks to demystify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the,</v>

100
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 1>the arts at least I don't know that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

101
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that they're using</v>

102
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 1>reduction</v>

103
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 2>and as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're absolutely right.</v>

104
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the artists tries to</v>
<v Speaker 2>demystify that is not the purpose of</v>

105
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 2>reduction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The purpose of reduction is to increase</v>

106
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 2>the mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean one of the wonderful things about</v>

107
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 2>abstract painting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we look at a de Kooning of we look at</v>

108
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:46.241
<v Speaker 2>a Jackson pollock is because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>information is often ambiguous.</v>

109
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.840
<v Speaker 2>It forces us to fill in the detail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I described this in the book in</v>

110
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:56.990
<v Speaker 2>terms of top down processing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We rely on our free association,</v>

111
00:06:56.991 --> 00:06:59.570
<v Speaker 2>our memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our previous experience to fill in the</v>

112
00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:03.230
<v Speaker 2>detail of ambiguity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that means that you recruit the</v>

113
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:06.230
<v Speaker 2>beholder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the participant in the creative act.</v>

114
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 2>This actually goes back to Alice Rigo</v>
<v Speaker 2>and took umbrage and turns.</v>

115
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who pointed out that when you and I look</v>

116
00:07:13.341 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 2>at the same painting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see it somewhat differently.</v>

117
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.963
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

118
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 2>That each of us is recreating in our own</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain?</v>

119
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.630
<v Speaker 2>The image that we are looking at that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beholder undergoes in a very modest</v>

120
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:29.510
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a creative experience that parallels in</v>

121
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 2>a very modest way the creativity of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>artist.</v>

122
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 2>And why is that interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether you've had that</v>

123
00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly I find when I have the</v>

124
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:43.850
<v Speaker 2>most modest creative idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives me a great deal of pleasure.</v>

125
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:49.150
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the things that is so</v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasurable about abstract off for those</v>

126
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:54.110
<v Speaker 2>people who respond to it is that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you lots of room for your own</v>

127
00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:54.944
<v Speaker 2>creativity.</v>

128
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.360
<v Speaker 1>So now what's interesting though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these abstract painters,</v>

129
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:02.140
<v Speaker 1>and not all the painters that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>described in the book are abstract.</v>

130
00:08:02.141 --> 00:08:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chuck close,</v>

131
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.920
<v Speaker 1>you use this abstraction to build up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:08:05.921 --> 00:08:09.010
<v Speaker 1>portraits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is that in a way they're,</v>

133
00:08:09.011 --> 00:08:14.011
<v Speaker 1>they seem to be seeding some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the control of the artist over</v>

134
00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:19.450
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beholders share like increasingly by</v>

135
00:08:19.451 --> 00:08:21.150
<v Speaker 1>saying absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

136
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.860
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The share is,</v>

137
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:28.070
<v Speaker 2>has a more prominent feature in abstract</v>
<v Speaker 2>art than it hasn't figured of art.</v>

138
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:33.830
<v Speaker 2>And this is one reason why some people</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like abstract on too much work for</v>

139
00:08:34.171 --> 00:08:36.960
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but other people who enjoy this get a</v>

140
00:08:36.961 --> 00:08:38.310
<v Speaker 2>lot of satisfaction out of it.</v>

141
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.920
<v Speaker 1>I guess where I was going with that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it seems an unusual move for an</v>

142
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.070
<v Speaker 1>artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like our stereotype of artists is that</v>

143
00:08:48.071 --> 00:08:50.770
<v Speaker 1>they can be somewhat of control freaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:08:50.771 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 1>wanting total control over the process</v>
<v Speaker 1>and over how the thing is perceived.</v>

145
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

146
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely true of writers to</v>
<v Speaker 2>some extent,</v>

147
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.730
<v Speaker 2>but for them to make this move of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

148
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.350
<v Speaker 2>giving more and more over to the viewer</v>
<v Speaker 2>is an interesting move.</v>

149
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.300
<v Speaker 2>I get your point and you're 100% right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is only one dimension of it.</v>

150
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.070
<v Speaker 2>I think they all control freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that pollock and de Kooning are</v>

151
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:16.800
<v Speaker 2>perfectionist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're the,</v>

152
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:21.480
<v Speaker 2>I discussed this one painting that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rosenberg who it was a superior,</v>

153
00:09:21.481 --> 00:09:22.490
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professorship here.</v>

154
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Columbia came to visit him and saw this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>

155
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:28.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a wonderful petty at decoding,</v>

156
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:31.800
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to release the painting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't think it was ready to go cause</v>

157
00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still felt he could approve it and</v>

158
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:36.270
<v Speaker 2>he told him this is a masterpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get it out right now.</v>

159
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.180
<v Speaker 2>So I mean they are very much control</v>
<v Speaker 2>freaks,</v>

160
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.710
<v Speaker 2>but they control freaks in the way they</v>
<v Speaker 2>control Mba and they're controlling,</v>

161
00:09:43.711 --> 00:09:47.070
<v Speaker 2>I guess their own sort of their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

162
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.360
<v Speaker 2>their own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

163
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:49.061
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

164
00:09:49.061 --> 00:09:50.160
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then and then it's,</v>

165
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:51.300
<v Speaker 2>then it's up to the viewer.</v>

166
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.630
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

167
00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

168
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.290
<v Speaker 1>well I think that might be a good moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us to transition into the,</v>

169
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second part of this.</v>

170
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

171
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this first one is Jan 11,</v>

172
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:10.260
<v Speaker 1>who's an astrophysicist and the video is</v>
<v Speaker 1>called three visionary scientists who</v>

173
00:10:10.301 --> 00:10:14.200
<v Speaker 1>embraced limitations to have creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>outbursts.</v>

174
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.320
<v Speaker 3>I became interested in this phenomenon</v>
<v Speaker 3>of constraints,</v>

175
00:10:26.141 --> 00:10:31.141
<v Speaker 3>inspiring creative outbursts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at the last century,</v>

176
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.930
<v Speaker 3>there were three really profound</v>
<v Speaker 3>examples of that.</v>

177
00:10:34.931 --> 00:10:38.950
<v Speaker 3>I would say the earliest that I found</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly interesting was the limit of</v>

178
00:10:38.951 --> 00:10:43.951
<v Speaker 3>the speed of light leading Einstein to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the theory of relativity where a lot of</v>

179
00:10:44.531 --> 00:10:47.860
<v Speaker 3>other scientists wanted to remove the</v>
<v Speaker 3>limit.</v>

180
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.320
<v Speaker 3>They want it to say there is no limit to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the speed of light.</v>

181
00:10:50.321 --> 00:10:52.510
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's impossible.</v>

182
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.810
<v Speaker 3>Einstein actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite the word relativity,</v>

183
00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.040
<v Speaker 3>adhere to a very strict absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that absolute was the speed of</v>

184
00:11:00.041 --> 00:11:02.980
<v Speaker 3>light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He took that to be his guiding</v>

185
00:11:02.981 --> 00:11:06.640
<v Speaker 3>constraint and by sticking to it</v>
<v Speaker 3>rigidly,</v>

186
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.340
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give up anything else but the speed</v>

187
00:11:09.341 --> 00:11:11.650
<v Speaker 3>of light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by doing so,</v>

188
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.860
<v Speaker 3>he gave up on the absolute nature of</v>
<v Speaker 3>space and time.</v>

189
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.660
<v Speaker 3>So I mean that's just much harder to let</v>
<v Speaker 3>go of intuitively,</v>

190
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:20.840
<v Speaker 3>but it was right,</v>

191
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:21.843
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

192
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.760
<v Speaker 1>So she's talking about embracing</v>
<v Speaker 1>limitation,</v>

193
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.330
<v Speaker 1>like how limitation can actually push</v>
<v Speaker 1>science forward.</v>

194
00:11:32.331 --> 00:11:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Have you found that to be true in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own work?</v>

195
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:35.831
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

196
00:11:35.831 --> 00:11:35.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

197
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.450
<v Speaker 2>in a sense it isn't quite a reductionist</v>
<v Speaker 2>approach,</v>

198
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:44.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's focusing on one thing to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>exclusion of others in a sense.</v>

199
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.740
<v Speaker 2>And certainly if you look at the history</v>
<v Speaker 2>of go beyond mammies,</v>

200
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:53.350
<v Speaker 2>do I take a larger problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the explosion and</v>

201
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:58.351
<v Speaker 2>understanding the biology of life that</v>
<v Speaker 2>came with the discovery of genes by</v>

202
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.260
<v Speaker 2>Mendel and then later on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Thomas and Morgan realizing that</v>

203
00:12:04.261 --> 00:12:08.050
<v Speaker 2>genes are on chromosomes and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>discovery,</v>

204
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 2>the jeans are made out of DNA than a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fabulous watson crick discovery about</v>

205
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:18.241
<v Speaker 2>the structure of DNA of the gene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these are all focusing on the</v>

206
00:12:19.031 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Speaker 2>gene to exclusion of carbohydrate</v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolism,</v>

207
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:23.110
<v Speaker 2>lipid metabolism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>

208
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.700
<v Speaker 2>Those are secondary processes that</v>
<v Speaker 2>derive from genetic control of cellular</v>

209
00:12:27.701 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 2>processes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think in a sense,</v>

210
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:33.760
<v Speaker 2>this is not a universal strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a common strategy.</v>

211
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Often there are major variables that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you understand them,</v>

212
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.670
<v Speaker 2>other things will follow more readily.</v>

213
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:43.280
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was a Karl Popper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>

214
00:12:43.281 --> 00:12:46.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the WHO spoke about paradigm shifts and</v>

215
00:12:46.251 --> 00:12:51.251
<v Speaker 1>how essentially science proceeds by</v>
<v Speaker 1>people laboring in specific trenches for</v>

216
00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.790
<v Speaker 1>long periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then either you have a visionary who</v>

217
00:12:55.791 --> 00:12:57.950
<v Speaker 1>breaks things open or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

218
00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.880
<v Speaker 1>or those limitations of focus end up</v>
<v Speaker 1>leading to breakthroughs.</v>

219
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.240
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] pump has been very important</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my field.</v>

220
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.190
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the following way,</v>

221
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.520
<v Speaker 2>a cop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Papa felt you can't prove anything in</v>

222
00:13:10.521 --> 00:13:13.040
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you can do is disprove.</v>

223
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:17.810
<v Speaker 2>And that turned out to be a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>important historical insights.</v>

224
00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy by the name of Jack</v>

225
00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.020
<v Speaker 2>Eccles who was a major,</v>
<v Speaker 2>major person in my field and major</v>

226
00:13:24.021 --> 00:13:28.070
<v Speaker 2>student of synaptic transmission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he thought synaptic transmission</v>

227
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:31.790
<v Speaker 2>between nerve cells was mostly</v>
<v Speaker 2>electrical.</v>

228
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.800
<v Speaker 2>And with time it became clearer and</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearer that this was likely to be</v>

229
00:13:36.801 --> 00:13:40.640
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And echoes became despondent at that</v>

230
00:13:40.641 --> 00:13:41.474
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

231
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.030
<v Speaker 2>I think he was in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget where he was,</v>

232
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:48.170
<v Speaker 2>but he went to the faculty club and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>bumped into popper and they became</v>

233
00:13:48.171 --> 00:13:50.750
<v Speaker 2>friends and he explained to him why he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was depressed.</v>

234
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.820
<v Speaker 2>And Papa said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>

235
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.790
<v Speaker 2>You can't ever prove anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you can do is to disprove it,</v>

236
00:13:55.791 --> 00:13:58.820
<v Speaker 2>go back into the lab and disprove</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

237
00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.820
<v Speaker 2>show that you were wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's not electrical,</v>

238
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:04.760
<v Speaker 2>that it must be chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what he did,</v>

239
00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.830
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

240
00:14:06.831 --> 00:14:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I guess I would be interested in hearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of as an adjunct to this,</v>

241
00:14:10.671 --> 00:14:13.760
<v Speaker 1>what you know in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your field and the work that in the</v>

242
00:14:13.761 --> 00:14:17.420
<v Speaker 1>work that you do on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on memory and brain science,</v>

243
00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:22.630
<v Speaker 1>what are the intractable problems right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that people are finding themselves</v>

244
00:14:22.671 --> 00:14:25.070
<v Speaker 1>bumping up against that if they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve them,</v>

245
00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.750
<v Speaker 1>it would be a major,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.730
<v Speaker 1>move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What seemed to be the new frontiers</v>

247
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.080
<v Speaker 1>right now for brain science?</v>

248
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.450
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

249
00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.530
<v Speaker 2>what is responsible for the reliability</v>
<v Speaker 2>of memory on the one hand.</v>

250
00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.680
<v Speaker 2>And it's extraordinary unreliability and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>

251
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

252
00:14:42.441 --> 00:14:46.150
<v Speaker 2>often we have the feeling we remember</v>
<v Speaker 2>something when we don't write a well,</v>

253
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.110
<v Speaker 2>we misremember it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

254
00:14:48.111 --> 00:14:49.730
<v Speaker 2>and this is why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

255
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:54.850
<v Speaker 2>testimony in is so unreliable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A single observer,</v>

256
00:14:55.430 --> 00:15:00.430
<v Speaker 2>remembering an event has a finite and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not too small chance of being wrong,</v>

257
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.300
<v Speaker 2>not by being dishonest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by just misperceiving misremembering,</v>

258
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.640
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So memory is not,</v>

259
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stamping something into a book and you</v>

260
00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:13.430
<v Speaker 2>never have to worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's often modified as a result of</v>

261
00:15:13.431 --> 00:15:16.190
<v Speaker 2>subsequent experiences without being</v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of it.</v>

262
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.900
<v Speaker 2>So trying to figure out what controls</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and how we can get a better idea</v>

263
00:15:20.901 --> 00:15:24.470
<v Speaker 2>into the core of the memory process is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very active part of the field.</v>

264
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.440
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that that may have</v>

265
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:28.460
<v Speaker 2>something to do?</v>

266
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a cognitive standpoint that that</v>

267
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:34.160
<v Speaker 2>may have something to do with kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pragmatics of memory?</v>

268
00:15:34.161 --> 00:15:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is that we actually need to</v>

269
00:15:36.681 --> 00:15:40.520
<v Speaker 2>remember in order to survive versus what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't.</v>

270
00:15:40.521 --> 00:15:43.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it deals with the</v>

271
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:46.760
<v Speaker 2>pragmatics of memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it deals with the pragmatics of</v>

272
00:15:46.761 --> 00:15:48.170
<v Speaker 2>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

273
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember this conversation for example</v>

274
00:15:50.931 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 2>we're having right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

275
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.960
<v Speaker 2>and it's possible that I'm sitting down</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day listening to a similar</v>

276
00:15:56.961 --> 00:16:00.860
<v Speaker 2>conversation and I may confuse that</v>
<v Speaker 2>second conversation.</v>

277
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.130
<v Speaker 2>At a subsequent time as being part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first conversation,</v>

278
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.400
<v Speaker 2>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the initial memory and you often bring</v>

279
00:16:07.401 --> 00:16:11.600
<v Speaker 2>to bear on it some of the subsequent</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences associated with the second</v>

280
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:14.630
<v Speaker 2>sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just the first possibly because</v>

281
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.700
<v Speaker 2>those things are being stored in us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

282
00:16:16.701 --> 00:16:20.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not asking you to speculate on</v>
<v Speaker 2>science that hasn't been done yet,</v>

283
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:25.361
<v Speaker 2>but possibly because those memories are</v>
<v Speaker 2>stored in similar areas and we're</v>

284
00:16:26.001 --> 00:16:27.830
<v Speaker 2>conserving space or something.</v>

285
00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.620
<v Speaker 2>They tried it and it can be activated in</v>
<v Speaker 2>different words.</v>

286
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:35.330
<v Speaker 2>And also when a memory is recalled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly the first few times it</v>

287
00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:39.890
<v Speaker 2>sensitive to disruption and distortion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so those things can interfere with the</v>

288
00:16:39.891 --> 00:16:44.891
<v Speaker 2>longterm fidelity of the memory storage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that disruption or distortion</v>

289
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.600
<v Speaker 2>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like so when I'm recalling the</v>

290
00:16:47.601 --> 00:16:51.680
<v Speaker 2>memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first few times it be the disruption</v>

291
00:16:51.681 --> 00:16:54.470
<v Speaker 2>is only in the sense that the memory is</v>
<v Speaker 2>fixed,</v>

292
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:58.070
<v Speaker 2>but the structures that fix it become</v>
<v Speaker 2>unglued for a second,</v>

293
00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.840
<v Speaker 2>for short period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the memory if perturbed can be</v>

294
00:17:02.841 --> 00:17:04.460
<v Speaker 2>altered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if something like,</v>

295
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.590
<v Speaker 2>so let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me put it to you this way.</v>

296
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.950
<v Speaker 2>When you form a memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a short term.</v>

297
00:17:08.951 --> 00:17:12.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean it doesn't persist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you train repeatedly,</v>

298
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:17.030
<v Speaker 2>you form a longterm memory and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm it consists of growth of new</v>

299
00:17:17.031 --> 00:17:20.750
<v Speaker 2>synaptic connections and those synaptic</v>
<v Speaker 2>connections require new protein</v>

300
00:17:20.751 --> 00:17:24.920
<v Speaker 2>synthesis doing a certain critical</v>
<v Speaker 2>period that protein synthesis is</v>

301
00:17:24.921 --> 00:17:29.921
<v Speaker 2>sensitive to disruption and you can lose</v>
<v Speaker 2>the growth of new synaptic connections</v>

302
00:17:30.081 --> 00:17:34.070
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that they've occurred</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the synthesis is not ongoing</v>

303
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.980
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while that no longer happens,</v>

304
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:39.890
<v Speaker 2>but in the early stages of longterm</v>
<v Speaker 2>memory storage,</v>

305
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.420
<v Speaker 2>it's susceptible to disruption and</v>
<v Speaker 2>disruption can come from like other</v>

306
00:17:44.421 --> 00:17:47.390
<v Speaker 2>memories or ambient things happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>around you,</v>

307
00:17:47.391 --> 00:17:48.660
<v Speaker 2>other experiences of the men.</v>

308
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

309
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

310
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Well I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think on that note,</v>

311
00:17:53.971 --> 00:17:54.804
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

312
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.760
<v Speaker 1>let's move on to the second surprise</v>
<v Speaker 1>clip.</v>

313
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:02.210
<v Speaker 1>This is Harvard psychologist Susan David</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the psychology of defeating fear,</v>

314
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.690
<v Speaker 1>low self esteem and hate live in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind</v>

315
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.530
<v Speaker 3>when we have politicians who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>effectively demagogues,</v>

316
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.920
<v Speaker 3>who are inspiring fear in us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fear leads to very particular and</v>

317
00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:29.780
<v Speaker 3>relatively predictable responses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we off fearful there is this idea</v>

318
00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:36.111
<v Speaker 3>in psychological research of mortality</v>
<v Speaker 3>salience that when our mortality is</v>

319
00:18:37.921 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Speaker 3>threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when someone says,</v>

320
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this group of people is out to get you</v>

321
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.740
<v Speaker 3>and we feel that we are actively being</v>
<v Speaker 3>threatened,</v>

322
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:52.310
<v Speaker 3>we are more likely to stereotype,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are more likely to respond to</v>

323
00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:58.200
<v Speaker 3>messages that we hear time and time</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

324
00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:03.590
<v Speaker 3>even if they are against our values as</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow making sense to us.</v>

325
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.730
<v Speaker 3>How do we protect ourselves against</v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

326
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:14.750
<v Speaker 3>Daniel Conaman describes system one</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking and system two thinking system.</v>

327
00:19:15.241 --> 00:19:20.241
<v Speaker 3>One thinking is the intuitive response</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can sometimes arise out of fear</v>

328
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:26.990
<v Speaker 3>system two is the deliberate thoughtful</v>
<v Speaker 3>examination of what is this person's</v>

329
00:19:28.941 --> 00:19:31.740
<v Speaker 3>saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it aligned with how I really want to</v>

330
00:19:31.741 --> 00:19:36.230
<v Speaker 3>be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we are able to step back from our</v>

331
00:19:36.231 --> 00:19:39.150
<v Speaker 3>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are able to come to a place where we</v>

332
00:19:39.151 --> 00:19:43.620
<v Speaker 3>are ultimately protected from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>demagoguery message.</v>

333
00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're talking about demagoguery and</v>

334
00:19:50.841 --> 00:19:55.010
<v Speaker 1>fear and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess an immediate point of reference</v>

335
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.390
<v Speaker 1>in America in 2016 leaps to all of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>minds immediately.</v>

336
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:04.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have have really your experiences like</v>

337
00:20:04.791 --> 00:20:05.301
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

338
00:20:05.301 --> 00:20:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I would like to hear about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

339
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

340
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.650
<v Speaker 2>Jewish and I was born in Vienna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Austria,</v>

341
00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.350
<v Speaker 2>and Myrna was nine years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

342
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Hitler marched into Austria and was</v>
<v Speaker 2>received by the Viennese in Vienna where</v>

343
00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:24.270
<v Speaker 2>I was living with open arms and</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately people who have been our</v>

344
00:20:24.271 --> 00:20:28.020
<v Speaker 2>friends turned away from us and</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially became our enemies.</v>

345
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:33.320
<v Speaker 2>And that's because Hitler had fantastic</v>
<v Speaker 2>antisemitic propaganda and he got this</v>

346
00:20:34.951 --> 00:20:39.951
<v Speaker 2>propaganda in pod from an earlier</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vinnie's Hitler was in Vienna in 1906</v>

347
00:20:42.271 --> 00:20:47.271
<v Speaker 2>1910 and the mayor of Vienna at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>time was a guy called Carl Louie Vega,</v>

348
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:52.950
<v Speaker 2>and Lucas was a terrific orator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tremendous campaigner.</v>

349
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.960
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't even all that antisemitic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had Jewish friends.</v>

350
00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:00.790
<v Speaker 2>He would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I determine who was a Jew,</v>

351
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:05.200
<v Speaker 2>but he had a fantastic way of saying the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason you don't have any money is</v>

352
00:21:05.201 --> 00:21:07.360
<v Speaker 2>because the Jews are taking it away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

353
00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.090
<v Speaker 2>It scared the hell out of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly those that didn't have</v>

354
00:21:10.091 --> 00:21:12.760
<v Speaker 2>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>convincing them that the Jews,</v>

355
00:21:12.761 --> 00:21:15.640
<v Speaker 2>by charging high prices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by creating works of art,</v>

356
00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:16.820
<v Speaker 2>that expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

357
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God knows how many reasons we're</v>

358
00:21:18.491 --> 00:21:22.960
<v Speaker 2>destroying the quality of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He created this environment of fear</v>

359
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.230
<v Speaker 2>to which people respond to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler wrote in my comp,</v>

360
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I learned more from low how to run a</v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign than anybody else.</v>

361
00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.600
<v Speaker 2>And fear is of course the traditional</v>
<v Speaker 2>way in which people pilled up opposition</v>

362
00:21:34.601 --> 00:21:36.730
<v Speaker 2>to one force in order to get support for</v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

363
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.030
<v Speaker 2>And it ate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found it very hard for the longest</v>

364
00:21:40.031 --> 00:21:42.850
<v Speaker 2>time to understand how people can listen</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Haydn,</v>

365
00:21:42.851 --> 00:21:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Mozart and Beethoven one day and beat up</v>
<v Speaker 2>the juice the next.</v>

366
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

367
00:21:47.461 --> 00:21:51.940
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what that did you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you to you in terms of your thinking</v>

368
00:21:51.941 --> 00:21:56.941
<v Speaker 2>about humans at that early age to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>that transition happen almost overnight.</v>

369
00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Like do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have conscious memories of,</v>

370
00:22:01.331 --> 00:22:02.650
<v Speaker 2>of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

371
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

372
00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:08.620
<v Speaker 2>My brother had built this short wave</v>
<v Speaker 2>radio set and we were listening to it as</v>

373
00:22:08.621 --> 00:22:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Hitler unwatched and to Vienna and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>held them plots.</v>

374
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.790
<v Speaker 2>200,000 people came out and cheered him</v>
<v Speaker 2>like mad.</v>

375
00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it dominated the scene.</v>

376
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.930
<v Speaker 2>I walked the streets two days later and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a classmate of mine came up to me and</v>

377
00:22:21.931 --> 00:22:22.764
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>candle,</v>

378
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm never to speak to you again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was horrible.</v>

379
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

380
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.630
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ask yourself the question,</v>

381
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.110
<v Speaker 2>what is it that separates the good guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the bad guys?</v>

382
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.990
<v Speaker 2>And you come to the conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the current campaign in the</v>

383
00:22:34.991 --> 00:22:39.991
<v Speaker 2>United States illustrates that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that every one of us is capable of good</v>

384
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.930
<v Speaker 2>and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reinhold Niebuhr once said,</v>

385
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:49.000
<v Speaker 2>the capability of people for good makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy desirable.</v>

386
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:52.150
<v Speaker 2>That capability for evil mixed democracy</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>

387
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.620
<v Speaker 2>That's well said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I recently read a book called</v>

388
00:22:56.621 --> 00:23:01.621
<v Speaker 2>machete season and it was about what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened in Rwanda and it was primarily</v>

389
00:23:02.501 --> 00:23:07.120
<v Speaker 2>based on interviews with these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who had been just,</v>

390
00:23:07.121 --> 00:23:08.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>workers,</v>

391
00:23:08.381 --> 00:23:12.910
<v Speaker 2>ordinary people living in Rwanda who</v>
<v Speaker 2>then became the kind of soldiers of this</v>

392
00:23:12.911 --> 00:23:17.170
<v Speaker 2>campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this massacre against their tribal</v>

393
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.620
<v Speaker 2>enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just this sort of mundanity of the</v>

394
00:23:20.621 --> 00:23:25.150
<v Speaker 2>way in which they described going out</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day to hunt other people.</v>

395
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.940
<v Speaker 2>It was extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

396
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.850
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

397
00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Hannah Arendt called this the banality</v>
<v Speaker 2>of evil.</v>

398
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:32.703
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's a little bit,</v>

399
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very irritated with her use of</v>

400
00:23:36.011 --> 00:23:38.200
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was an ice man and Jerusalem,</v>

401
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil is not for now.</v>

402
00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.200
<v Speaker 2>And many of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly in [inaudible] case,</v>

403
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.050
<v Speaker 2>he was a major force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was not a follower.</v>

404
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.490
<v Speaker 2>He was a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

405
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.740
<v Speaker 2>but he was able to bring many people</v>
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>

406
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:51.561
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

407
00:23:51.561 --> 00:23:53.690
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are those people at the top who</v>

408
00:23:53.691 --> 00:23:57.800
<v Speaker 1>are very conscious and calculating yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And aware of what they're doing.</v>

409
00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

410
00:23:59.691 --> 00:24:00.441
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

411
00:24:00.441 --> 00:24:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

412
00:24:02.511 --> 00:24:04.790
<v Speaker 1>so I can't say whether it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump is,</v>

413
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:09.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally aware or conscious enough of</v>

414
00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:12.410
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing to be considered truly</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

415
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:13.670
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

416
00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.760
<v Speaker 1>with his followers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to look at it and you want to</v>

417
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:18.830
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are crazy.</v>

418
00:24:18.831 --> 00:24:22.820
<v Speaker 1>These people are stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But obviously that's not the case for</v>

419
00:24:22.821 --> 00:24:24.230
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

420
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Obviously our brains are vulnerable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of manipulation.</v>

421
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.270
<v Speaker 2>I think this is worth the trump movement</v>
<v Speaker 2>is shown,</v>

422
00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:37.271
<v Speaker 2>is you would never think that a movement</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this could succeed in the United</v>

423
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:40.490
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's amazing how far it has gone,</v>

424
00:24:40.491 --> 00:24:44.180
<v Speaker 2>although it is clearly fading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is that there were people who</v>

425
00:24:44.181 --> 00:24:48.650
<v Speaker 2>were dissatisfied with certain aspects</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our lifestyle to whom he appeals.</v>

426
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:51.890
<v Speaker 2>And he does it by phobia of strangers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

427
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:53.900
<v Speaker 2>preventing people from coming into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

428
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:54.851
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

429
00:24:54.851 --> 00:24:56.260
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any thought,</v>

430
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:59.050
<v Speaker 1>do you have any thoughts or insights</v>
<v Speaker 1>from your vantage point?</v>

431
00:24:59.051 --> 00:25:00.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of having experienced what you did as a</v>

432
00:25:00.911 --> 00:25:04.030
<v Speaker 1>kid and seeing this happening in America</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now,</v>

433
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:08.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into sort of what would be a better way</v>

434
00:25:08.321 --> 00:25:11.530
<v Speaker 1>to engage the people that are following</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump now?</v>

435
00:25:11.531 --> 00:25:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Like what is America not doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

436
00:25:13.661 --> 00:25:15.550
<v Speaker 1>I know you're not trying to run the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

437
00:25:15.551 --> 00:25:16.630
<v Speaker 1>but I'd be</v>

438
00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.020
<v Speaker 2>sure I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

439
00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:20.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm so startled by the success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

440
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:26.110
<v Speaker 2>I think the case could be stronger and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll be stronger if hilary ran a</v>

441
00:25:27.741 --> 00:25:31.910
<v Speaker 2>campaign a little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if she had run her life a little bit</v>

442
00:25:31.911 --> 00:25:32.960
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

443
00:25:32.961 --> 00:25:36.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she realized that she's interested in</v>

444
00:25:36.741 --> 00:25:41.060
<v Speaker 2>public office and I think the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>email thing could have been completely</v>

445
00:25:41.061 --> 00:25:46.061
<v Speaker 2>finesse more over this accepting large</v>
<v Speaker 2>sums of money from companies for giving</v>

446
00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:51.590
<v Speaker 2>lectures when she's going to run for</v>
<v Speaker 2>public office and realize the question</v>

447
00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:55.430
<v Speaker 2>is going to rise is she gets a half a</v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollars or whatever she did for</v>

448
00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.040
<v Speaker 2>a lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is she gonna feel beholden to those</v>

449
00:25:58.041 --> 00:25:59.270
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would?</v>

450
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.710
<v Speaker 2>You would think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

451
00:26:00.711 --> 00:26:04.400
<v Speaker 2>you and I of course would never be with</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the only guys that are half $1</v>

452
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.410
<v Speaker 2>million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Hillary Clinton who had does one no.</v>

453
00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a it that's right.</v>

454
00:26:08.101 --> 00:26:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if she is somehow immune from to</v>

455
00:26:11.671 --> 00:26:14.520
<v Speaker 1>their influences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to preserve the illusion of</v>

456
00:26:14.521 --> 00:26:16.740
<v Speaker 1>neutrality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's essential.</v>

457
00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

458
00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:22.260
<v Speaker 2>I think she made mistakes and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons trump is more</v>

459
00:26:22.261 --> 00:26:24.710
<v Speaker 2>successful than it might've been is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary,</v>

460
00:26:24.711 --> 00:26:28.170
<v Speaker 2>although I much prefer her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think she would probably make a</v>

461
00:26:28.171 --> 00:26:29.840
<v Speaker 2>very good precedent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

462
00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:34.620
<v Speaker 2>did not handle herself in her public</v>
<v Speaker 2>life in an ideal fashion.</v>

463
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.220
<v Speaker 2>She did not handle herself the way Obama</v>
<v Speaker 2>has handled himself,</v>

464
00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.800
<v Speaker 2>which I think is extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

465
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:42.350
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>

466
00:26:42.351 --> 00:26:46.620
<v Speaker 1>there just seems be so much anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much fear here.</v>

467
00:26:46.621 --> 00:26:48.540
<v Speaker 1>And like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for me to believe that trump</v>

468
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:50.400
<v Speaker 1>just instilled that in everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

469
00:26:50.401 --> 00:26:55.350
<v Speaker 1>obviously there were large numbers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people concerned about immigrants taking</v>

470
00:26:55.351 --> 00:26:57.030
<v Speaker 1>their jobs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

471
00:26:57.031 --> 00:26:58.020
<v Speaker 1>that have these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

472
00:26:58.021 --> 00:27:00.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you know our country is not perfect.</v>

473
00:27:00.571 --> 00:27:05.571
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the number of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have billions and see where taxes they</v>

474
00:27:05.701 --> 00:27:10.590
<v Speaker 1>pay compared to people earning 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$50,000 or $80,000,</v>

475
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:11.581
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

476
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

477
00:27:13.201 --> 00:27:15.720
<v Speaker 1>there were problems in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I complain?</v>

478
00:27:15.721 --> 00:27:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Not too seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is heaven on earth.</v>

479
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I've had a wonderful life here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

480
00:27:21.001 --> 00:27:21.481
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

481
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:24.270
<v Speaker 1>I'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like it to remain so for coming</v>

482
00:27:24.271 --> 00:27:27.900
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully we can avoid trump getting</v>

483
00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:32.330
<v Speaker 1>elected or any repeat thereof because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just doesn't bode well for,</v>

484
00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:33.990
<v Speaker 1>for our future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

485
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

486
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up the price of democracy is</v>

487
00:27:36.811 --> 00:27:38.670
<v Speaker 1>constant vigilance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

488
00:27:38.671 --> 00:27:40.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm repeating cliches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

489
00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:40.621
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

490
00:27:40.621 --> 00:27:41.100
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

491
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is true.</v>

492
00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:46.120
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's move on to the third and final</v>

493
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:46.950
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

494
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:51.240
<v Speaker 1>This is George Muster on the strangeness</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Physics and Telepathy.</v>

495
00:27:55.870 --> 00:28:00.580
<v Speaker 4>The whole progress of physics is to</v>
<v Speaker 4>start with our everyday experience and</v>

496
00:28:00.581 --> 00:28:04.150
<v Speaker 4>to analyze it and look at it and look</v>
<v Speaker 4>for deviations from it.</v>

497
00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:08.230
<v Speaker 4>So the very nature of action,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really all the natural sciences,</v>

498
00:28:08.231 --> 00:28:12.160
<v Speaker 4>but certainly a physics is to really get</v>
<v Speaker 4>away from our experience.</v>

499
00:28:12.161 --> 00:28:16.450
<v Speaker 4>So the things physics comes up with are</v>
<v Speaker 4>just kind of a weird sub atomic</v>

500
00:28:16.451 --> 00:28:18.700
<v Speaker 4>particles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't see them directly at least,</v>

501
00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.580
<v Speaker 4>but we know they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can actually do thought experiments</v>

502
00:28:21.581 --> 00:28:24.340
<v Speaker 4>about the things we do see and deduce</v>
<v Speaker 4>their existence.</v>

503
00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.090
<v Speaker 4>So already,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even with just that limited an example,</v>

504
00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:33.040
<v Speaker 4>we've gone intra beyond our direct</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience in a hundred years ago or so,</v>

505
00:28:33.041 --> 00:28:37.510
<v Speaker 4>people doubted the existence of atoms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of loan sub atomic particles,</v>

506
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:41.080
<v Speaker 4>nonlocality spooky action at a distance</v>
<v Speaker 4>is very much in that,</v>

507
00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:43.960
<v Speaker 4>in that mold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's taking this yet further away from</v>

508
00:28:43.961 --> 00:28:47.020
<v Speaker 4>our experience and therefore we expect</v>
<v Speaker 4>it to be weird.</v>

509
00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.880
<v Speaker 4>It shouldn't be weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why physics is flooded.</v>

510
00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.860
<v Speaker 4>And as other scientists have said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would expect it.</v>

511
00:28:53.861 --> 00:28:55.630
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the theory isn't weird,</v>

512
00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.960
<v Speaker 4>you kind of doubt it cause you worry</v>
<v Speaker 4>that your own biases are intruding into</v>

513
00:29:01.961 --> 00:29:05.050
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the theory and causing you to think</v>

514
00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:09.370
<v Speaker 4>the world is a certain way when you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>not listening to the way the world</v>

515
00:29:09.371 --> 00:29:13.030
<v Speaker 4>actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So weirdnesses in a sense a test of a</v>

516
00:29:13.031 --> 00:29:13.864
<v Speaker 4>theory.</v>

517
00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I blog actually,</v>

518
00:29:19.991 --> 00:29:22.120
<v Speaker 2>but not completely agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

519
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't think physics necessarily has to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be weird and did weirdness.</v>

520
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Sydney's not a test of the reliability</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it</v>

521
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:29.663
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>

522
00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:35.550
<v Speaker 2>but certainly it deals with phenomenon</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we do not intuitively think about</v>

523
00:29:36.191 --> 00:29:38.460
<v Speaker 2>all the time or at least people outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>of physics.</v>

524
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:41.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it deals with many that are</v>

525
00:29:41.441 --> 00:29:43.030
<v Speaker 2>invisible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be inferred.</v>

526
00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:46.210
<v Speaker 2>And some day biology will reach that</v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

527
00:29:46.211 --> 00:29:48.220
<v Speaker 2>At the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the case.</v>

528
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biology doesn't that all deal with</v>

529
00:29:50.651 --> 00:29:52.900
<v Speaker 2>things that are weird?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's some weird things come out</v>

530
00:29:52.901 --> 00:29:55.180
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he tries to explain,</v>

531
00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:59.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living processes that make intuitive</v>

532
00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:02.620
<v Speaker 2>sense and we want to understand them in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a more profound when you can you say</v>

533
00:30:02.621 --> 00:30:05.140
<v Speaker 2>more about what you mean by Sunday</v>
<v Speaker 2>biology make,</v>

534
00:30:05.141 --> 00:30:06.150
<v Speaker 2>make out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

535
00:30:06.151 --> 00:30:07.420
<v Speaker 2>why would that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

536
00:30:07.421 --> 00:30:11.500
<v Speaker 2>I think we probably want to understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>things on a deeper level right now.</v>

537
00:30:11.501 --> 00:30:14.230
<v Speaker 2>If we understand that the level of of</v>
<v Speaker 2>molecules,</v>

538
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.540
<v Speaker 2>we think we're making a great deal of</v>
<v Speaker 2>progress,</v>

539
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:18.630
<v Speaker 2>but we may want to make it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

540
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.990
<v Speaker 2>on an even more profound level on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>level of electron movement or something</v>

541
00:30:22.991 --> 00:30:23.824
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

542
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:27.100
<v Speaker 2>We seen this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact take theory,</v>

543
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:30.160
<v Speaker 2>which has such an important role in</v>
<v Speaker 2>physics.</v>

544
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:34.090
<v Speaker 2>It didn't have an important role in</v>
<v Speaker 2>biology for the longest time.</v>

545
00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I came along there was a fair</v>

546
00:30:37.121 --> 00:30:39.850
<v Speaker 2>amount of theory going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was mostly Malarkey,</v>

547
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you can make a theory about</v>

548
00:30:41.621 --> 00:30:44.070
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to have a theory about memory.</v>

549
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.390
<v Speaker 2>I give you a five tiers of our memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

550
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.750
<v Speaker 2>people were coming up with theories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were not testing them.</v>

551
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.890
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is changed.</v>

552
00:30:50.891 --> 00:30:53.260
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Series had a major comeback in the last</v>

553
00:30:53.261 --> 00:30:56.740
<v Speaker 2>15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was true for a long time in physics</v>

554
00:30:56.741 --> 00:30:57.401
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

555
00:30:57.401 --> 00:31:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean they had all these theories that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't able to test without the</v>

556
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:03.370
<v Speaker 2>particle reactors and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

557
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.130
<v Speaker 2>so from the standpoint of lay people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

558
00:31:06.131 --> 00:31:08.520
<v Speaker 2>what on earth are they talking about?</v>

559
00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.370
<v Speaker 2>It's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

560
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:11.350
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in brain science it was a little bit</v>

561
00:31:11.351 --> 00:31:14.620
<v Speaker 2>different because they could test it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't think of doing it.</v>

562
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.890
<v Speaker 2>They didn't think it was necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

563
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.480
<v Speaker 2>To test the theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact is we can develop a theory</v>

564
00:31:19.481 --> 00:31:23.140
<v Speaker 2>for anything unless you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now this is a prediction.</v>

565
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Let's run an experiment to test that</v>
<v Speaker 2>prediction,</v>

566
00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.660
<v Speaker 2>which is what's going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does brand science.</v>

567
00:31:28.661 --> 00:31:33.250
<v Speaker 2>You talked a little bit about your book</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your book about how brain science and</v>

568
00:31:33.251 --> 00:31:36.720
<v Speaker 2>psychology have somewhat merged in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

569
00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.760
<v Speaker 2>that Ronnie has impact on one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

570
00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:42.670
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an area in which,</v>

571
00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people outside of psychology,</v>

572
00:31:45.221 --> 00:31:48.340
<v Speaker 2>even in the early stages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists thought that these</v>

573
00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.240
<v Speaker 2>primitive guys from brain science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I eat us up,</v>

574
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:54.820
<v Speaker 2>they want to swallow the fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not,</v>

575
00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:59.970
<v Speaker 2>you cannot do biology of the mind</v>
<v Speaker 2>without being a psychologist.</v>

576
00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean psychologist described many of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the obvious central phenomenon,</v>

577
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:08.290
<v Speaker 2>a classical conditioning perception</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensation.</v>

578
00:32:08.291 --> 00:32:12.670
<v Speaker 2>All of these things were studied in very</v>
<v Speaker 2>reliable ways in psychophysical terms.</v>

579
00:32:12.671 --> 00:32:17.080
<v Speaker 2>And we we now want to do is add the</v>
<v Speaker 2>biology to it and give it a new depth</v>

580
00:32:17.081 --> 00:32:21.370
<v Speaker 2>and new level of understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a beautiful case of coming</v>

581
00:32:21.371 --> 00:32:22.001
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

582
00:32:22.001 --> 00:32:23.630
<v Speaker 2>I would go further than this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

583
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:28.690
<v Speaker 2>I would say there had been a sequence of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mergers first it was a major between</v>

584
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:34.870
<v Speaker 2>cognitive psychology and brain biology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a new biology of mind.</v>

585
00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.800
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time this was occurring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was watson and Crick and,</v>

586
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.760
<v Speaker 2>and all these people are coming along</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing molecular biology.</v>

587
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:46.790
<v Speaker 2>And so the approaches of molecular</v>
<v Speaker 2>biology,</v>

588
00:32:46.791 --> 00:32:48.380
<v Speaker 2>cloning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gene sequencing,</v>

589
00:32:48.381 --> 00:32:53.180
<v Speaker 2>them figuring out their function through</v>
<v Speaker 2>mutations became applicable to the</v>

590
00:32:53.181 --> 00:32:56.240
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we can now test many of these ideas</v>

591
00:32:56.241 --> 00:32:59.210
<v Speaker 2>with powerful molecular approaches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knock out this gene,</v>

592
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:03.020
<v Speaker 2>get rid of this particular protein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this put brain science and a</v>

593
00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:04.030
<v Speaker 2>completely new level.</v>

594
00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:07.720
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean going back to the test case of</v>

595
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:12.750
<v Speaker 1>psychology and brain science though I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is kind of a beautiful model I</v>

596
00:33:12.851 --> 00:33:17.680
<v Speaker 1>suppose for the reconciliation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sciences and the humanities in a way</v>

597
00:33:17.681 --> 00:33:18.150
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

598
00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:19.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Secretary Collins,</v>

599
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:20.250
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all fairness,</v>

600
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:25.320
<v Speaker 2>by the time we got around to it was no</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer part of the humanities and</v>

601
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:28.770
<v Speaker 2>science as part of the management.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is a humanistic discipline,</v>

602
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:33.260
<v Speaker 2>but psychology at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive psychology was empirical out</v>

603
00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:36.900
<v Speaker 2>laboratory tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>experimental discipline.</v>

604
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

605
00:33:38.251 --> 00:33:38.730
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

606
00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:39.291
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm,</v>

607
00:33:39.291 --> 00:33:43.710
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm thinking of like theory of</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality and I'll do something else.</v>

608
00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:47.040
<v Speaker 2>The psychodynamics of it that still</v>
<v Speaker 2>soft.</v>

609
00:33:47.041 --> 00:33:47.570
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

610
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:48.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

611
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:51.540
<v Speaker 2>I was interested in psychoanalysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to become an analyst at one</v>

612
00:33:51.541 --> 00:33:56.430
<v Speaker 2>point and I'm glad I didn't go that</v>
<v Speaker 2>direction because psychoanalysis is</v>

613
00:33:56.431 --> 00:34:00.660
<v Speaker 2>dying and one of the reasons this dying</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it has not become empirical.</v>

614
00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet we do have these</v>

615
00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.460
<v Speaker 1>big questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know about like about meaning</v>

616
00:34:05.461 --> 00:34:08.160
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it means to live a good and</v>

617
00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.030
<v Speaker 1>authentic tic</v>

618
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:11.410
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of which are absolutely and,</v>

619
00:34:11.411 --> 00:34:15.290
<v Speaker 2>and you can ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy called Aaron Beck who</v>

620
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:17.370
<v Speaker 2>developed cognitive behavioral</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology.</v>

621
00:34:17.371 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether you know this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

622
00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:21.570
<v Speaker 2>He was interested in testing one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freud's ideas.</v>

623
00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Freud had the idea that people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed or angry,</v>

624
00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:28.170
<v Speaker 2>they first express the anger toward</v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

625
00:34:28.171 --> 00:34:30.690
<v Speaker 2>Then you feel guilty about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they internalize it,</v>

626
00:34:30.691 --> 00:34:32.790
<v Speaker 2>feel angry with themselves and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>caused the depression.</v>

627
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.590
<v Speaker 2>So Aaron Beck's what he would test this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would test it by using the royal</v>

628
00:34:37.591 --> 00:34:39.420
<v Speaker 2>road to the unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is dreaming.</v>

629
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.860
<v Speaker 2>So listen to the dream life is with</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed patients and did an all sound</v>

630
00:34:43.861 --> 00:34:47.850
<v Speaker 2>as if this was the problem with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they all sounded like is that they</v>

631
00:34:47.851 --> 00:34:50.380
<v Speaker 2>had a low image of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

632
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:54.240
<v Speaker 2>this guy was a famous radio interviewer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he thought of himself as being,</v>

633
00:34:54.241 --> 00:34:55.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

634
00:34:55.291 --> 00:34:58.410
<v Speaker 2>so a guy was very successful in</v>
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

635
00:34:58.411 --> 00:34:59.970
<v Speaker 2>thought it was a failure at home.</v>

636
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:04.410
<v Speaker 2>The low image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as he began to address himself to</v>

637
00:35:04.411 --> 00:35:06.450
<v Speaker 2>this issue of low image saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

638
00:35:06.451 --> 00:35:07.980
<v Speaker 2>why do you think you'd like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe?</v>

639
00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your family really enjoys you and</v>

640
00:35:10.501 --> 00:35:14.160
<v Speaker 2>appreciates you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He began to alters behavior and</v>

641
00:35:14.161 --> 00:35:18.660
<v Speaker 2>cognitive behavior therapy developed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what Aaron Beck did is to write a</v>

642
00:35:18.661 --> 00:35:21.510
<v Speaker 2>cookbook so you and I could do the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing I see.</v>

643
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:25.290
<v Speaker 2>And he asked other people to do this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were able to get the same results.</v>

644
00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:28.530
<v Speaker 2>And then he did a prayer call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outcome studies with controls showing</v>

645
00:35:28.531 --> 00:35:30.720
<v Speaker 2>that mild and moderate depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

646
00:35:30.721 --> 00:35:33.420
<v Speaker 2>significantly helped by cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior therapy.</v>

647
00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Severe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so much,</v>

648
00:35:35.311 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 2>but synergistic with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we worked very well.</v>

649
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:41.490
<v Speaker 2>So you can take these concepts and make</v>
<v Speaker 2>them scientific.</v>

650
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.190
<v Speaker 2>It just hasn't happened by and large in</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalysis.</v>

651
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:48.300
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if it works under what</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances and how it works.</v>

652
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.670
<v Speaker 2>And that's got to come if it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>survive at all.</v>

653
00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

654
00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>handle it has been wonderful talking to</v>

655
00:35:55.041 --> 00:35:56.750
<v Speaker 1>you today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much,</v>

656
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:57.531
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

657
00:35:57.531 --> 00:36:00.950
<v Speaker 1>for spending your time on this show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has been a lot of fun.</v>

658
00:36:00.951 --> 00:36:02.720
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to our audience,</v>

659
00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:07.910
<v Speaker 1>I would strongly recommend professor</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kendall's new book reductionism in art</v>

660
00:36:07.911 --> 00:36:10.790
<v Speaker 1>and brain science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is fascinating,</v>

661
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.030
<v Speaker 1>beautifully written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The science has explained incredibly</v>

662
00:36:14.031 --> 00:36:19.031
<v Speaker 1>clearly and it's full of gorgeous</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductions of modern paintings.</v>

663
00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for your time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Kendall.</v>

664
00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you for inviting me.</v>

665
00:36:22.371 --> 00:36:23.780
<v Speaker 2>This is very enjoyable for me.</v>

666
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Sit for this week's episode of think</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

667
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:35.730
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking lately on this show to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of artists and writers and it's</v>

668
00:36:35.731 --> 00:36:38.880
<v Speaker 1>really refreshing to speak to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist,</v>

669
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:44.270
<v Speaker 1>especially one who has lived through so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the major developments in the</v>

670
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.230
<v Speaker 1>past century in science and art and has</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much to say about them.</v>

671
00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I hope you enjoyed that conversation as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much as I did and we have lots of</v>

672
00:36:54.661 --> 00:36:57.330
<v Speaker 1>amazing things lined up this fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a really,</v>

673
00:36:57.331 --> 00:37:00.930
<v Speaker 1>really interesting fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going on a brief and much needed</v>

674
00:37:00.931 --> 00:37:03.780
<v Speaker 1>vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the show will be here and I hope to</v>

675
00:37:03.781 --> 00:37:04.740
<v Speaker 1>see you back here next week.</v>
