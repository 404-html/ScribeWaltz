1
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of interesting new</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology that scrubs job descriptions</v>

2
00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:13.460
<v Speaker 1>for gendered words because the layer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally the ways that companies are</v>

3
00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:18.461
<v Speaker 1>presenting opportunities is screening</v>
<v Speaker 1>out women are self screening out because</v>

4
00:00:19.221 --> 00:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>they're seeing words that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>relate to,</v>

5
00:00:21.171 --> 00:00:21.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resonate.</v>

6
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

7
00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:26.540
<v Speaker 1>So there's literally like technology is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to help us shortcut our</v>

8
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:30.920
<v Speaker 1>biases because we are so unfortunately</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of hopeless when it comes to.</v>

9
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>It's true with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard wired into us to be</v>

10
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:39.220
<v Speaker 1>biased against maybe ourselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>believing the stereotypes we hear,</v>

11
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then also particularly bias coming</v>

12
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.440
<v Speaker 1>out us of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from folks who have not done the work</v>

13
00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.740
<v Speaker 1>their own choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

15
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Getting us into boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to know from you,</v>

16
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.690
<v Speaker 1>so when you experienced in your career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe some stereotype threat and how did</v>

17
00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:57.380
<v Speaker 1>you correct for it?</v>

18
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.990
<v Speaker 1>When you know that it may be being</v>
<v Speaker 1>applied to Ya,</v>

19
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>how do you not get swamped by that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the death by a thousand cuts,</v>

20
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

21
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>it does accumulate and then it causes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of us frankly,</v>

22
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:11.300
<v Speaker 1>to leave organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

23
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't even put a death,</v>

24
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.950
<v Speaker 1>a fine point on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we feel,</v>

25
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.680
<v Speaker 1>don't feel valued and heard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcomed.</v>

26
00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did you overcome that and kind of</v>

27
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.270
<v Speaker 1>claim your power and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

28
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:24.990
<v Speaker 1>that's in line with a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.320
<v Speaker 1>so first by way of background as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor at Columbia and the first</v>

30
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:33.560
<v Speaker 1>African American to ever be tenured in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sciences since,</v>

31
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since,</v>

32
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.820
<v Speaker 1>since Columbia started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that says a lot.</v>

33
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:40.790
<v Speaker 1>So that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's incredible achievement,</v>

34
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:42.620
<v Speaker 1>but also says a lot about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

35
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about even where,</v>

36
00:01:43.571 --> 00:01:46.970
<v Speaker 1>where we are today because people think</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't struggle.</v>

37
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I struggle every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have perfectionistic syndrome where I</v>

38
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:57.950
<v Speaker 1>work on an article for a year and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>work on it for another year and I know</v>

39
00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 1>the literature that women are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to do that,</v>

40
00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 1>that perfectionistic syndrome is linked</v>
<v Speaker 1>to being worried about being</v>

41
00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:06.320
<v Speaker 1>stereotyped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

42
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make lots of decisions where,</v>

43
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.520
<v Speaker 1>where I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think very carefully about how I am</v>

44
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.020
<v Speaker 1>perceived by others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And oftentimes I'll be in say a faculty</v>

45
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:21.260
<v Speaker 1>meeting or even when I'm talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies and senior leaders and I'm</v>

46
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:21.980
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

47
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.730
<v Speaker 1>how many common should I make about race</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus gender versus religion?</v>

48
00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Like am I being seen as too this or too</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

49
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.830
<v Speaker 1>So I worry about these things all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

50
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.020
<v Speaker 1>But a couple of things I know to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

51
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.520
<v Speaker 1>One is that when you take calculated</v>
<v Speaker 1>risks,</v>

52
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you of put yourself a little bit out</v>

53
00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:43.190
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost always something amazing happens.</v>

54
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.910
<v Speaker 1>And so that is one thing that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned to.</v>

55
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.150
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity and inclusion architecture,</v>

56
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.500
<v Speaker 1>people don't understand the underlying</v>
<v Speaker 1>science and when they understand that</v>

57
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not about bad people doing bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

58
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>but about these structural differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of gives me hope.</v>

59
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>And that helps me take these calculated</v>
<v Speaker 1>risks.</v>

60
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 1>And I think the third thing is just me</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally knowing like I will feel</v>

61
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>anxiety every time I sit down to write a</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper and I go,</v>

62
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm the first African American tenured</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sciences.</v>

63
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>This has got to be really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

64
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>this has to be like great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what does,</v>

65
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I,</v>

66
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 1>what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I think about that,</v>

67
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.870
<v Speaker 1>I understand that that's coming partly</v>
<v Speaker 1>from an environment where there's lots</v>

68
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 1>of stereotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just knowing that sort of helps me kind</v>

69
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 1>of take a little bit off in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>

70
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's something that I still work</v>
<v Speaker 1>through everyday and it's something that</v>

71
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 1>I work with senior leaders to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminate that.</v>

72
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>When you see underperformance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in my field,</v>

73
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 1>it's how many articles are you writing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

74
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>but in the corporate world it might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many dollars are you bringing in or</v>

75
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 1>how many clients are you going to see or</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your investment portfolio looks</v>

76
00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I tell people is that</v>

77
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>underperformance is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean that you can't do it.</v>

78
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.010
<v Speaker 1>It might be something else that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about the structure.</v>

79
00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you must have the same at least</v>

80
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>kinds of experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love to do.</v>

81
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 1>I think that perfectionism is gendered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

82
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

83
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 1>and if I were a person of color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have it even worse because I think</v>

84
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 1>when you're the only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much pressure on your</v>

85
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 1>shoulders and this is the problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demographics as we see them in many</v>

86
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 1>companies are particularly at the senior</v>
<v Speaker 1>level when you are the only,</v>

87
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 1>there is just an undue amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance expectations.</v>

88
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.820
<v Speaker 1>It feels riskier because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're at that table like clinging to</v>

89
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 1>something that you've achieved and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are the first.</v>

90
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that it's double work,</v>

91
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 1>as you said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and triple work to not only be</v>

92
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 1>proficient and excellent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to be managing,</v>

93
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 1>am I safe here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I welcomed here,</v>

94
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 1>my valued here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I a token?</v>

95
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.871
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

96
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 1>all of those things that go through our</v>
<v Speaker 1>heads and so that's why I loved your</v>

97
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>comment about like who has supported you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help you believe not only do you</v>

98
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:09.250
<v Speaker 1>belong here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that you know you're,</v>

99
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.760
<v Speaker 1>you're a star and there are many stars</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind you.</v>

100
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:14.910
<v Speaker 1>You know that you're actually paving the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way for.</v>

101
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.510
<v Speaker 1>I know in so much of my work with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with lower level employees or early in</v>

102
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>career seeing leaders like you who did</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it,</v>

103
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.760
<v Speaker 1>just that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power of being able to see yourself</v>

104
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 1>reflected in someone who's achieved and</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the first is.</v>

105
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.460
<v Speaker 1>So it is one of those things that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think leaders don't understand their</v>

106
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.440
<v Speaker 1>role models every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything you do.</v>

107
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that you rather a lot.</v>

108
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.860
<v Speaker 1>You're your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

109
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:43.480
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>

110
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I remember early on in my career,</v>

111
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:48.700
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that when I worked</v>
<v Speaker 1>with earlier,</v>

112
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.430
<v Speaker 1>early career employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also talked to them about.</v>

113
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I used to ask people for feedback</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly and I would go find the</v>

114
00:05:57.921 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>person who I knew was going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most critical and I would say tell me</v>

115
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 1>about my work even though I was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fearful.</v>

116
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 1>So fast forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done research over the past 15</v>

117
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:14.201
<v Speaker 1>years showing that people with some kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of outsider status are less likely to</v>

118
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 1>receive informal feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everyone received formal feedback,</v>

119
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the year or you're mid</v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

121
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 1>your mid year review,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the watercooler feedback,</v>

122
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.990
<v Speaker 1>which is I really matters what really</v>
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

123
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

124
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that you should be doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or hey,</v>

125
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 1>have you thought about this or hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new something or other came out and</v>

126
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>you should do this or hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably didn't pull it together the</v>

127
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 1>way you should have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

128
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>come back the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That informal feedback is really what</v>

129
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 1>sort of pushes people in one and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>one direction or another.</v>

130
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 1>And so there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are all of these subtle.</v>

131
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 1>So the way I always think about it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the structure of the company</v>

132
00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.100
<v Speaker 1>that either gives rise or facilitate</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes and really unconscious ways,</v>

133
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.960
<v Speaker 1>or what is the company doing to mitigate</v>
<v Speaker 1>those stereotypes.</v>

134
00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 1>And that is all at a very unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

135
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
