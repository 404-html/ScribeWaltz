1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.600
<v Speaker 1>I've spent though asked a dozen years</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about,</v>

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I consider to be one of the</v>

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.790
<v Speaker 1>fundamental challenges of leadership in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the challenge to notice critical</v>

4
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:15.981
<v Speaker 1>information in your environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are so many interesting stories of</v>

5
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:20.880
<v Speaker 1>the new millennium of situations where</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were people who behaved</v>

6
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:25.881
<v Speaker 1>inappropriately and they get an awful</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of attention in the headlines from</v>

7
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.370
<v Speaker 1>madoff to jp Morgan's recent problems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enron and across the hundreds of</v>

8
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>scandals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are often some bad people doing</v>

9
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>some bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My focus is not on those individuals,</v>

10
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that in each of those cases</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are so many other people who</v>

11
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>should have noticed something was wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't.</v>

12
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Warren Bennis,</v>

13
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:53.620
<v Speaker 1>the leadership scholar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Speaker 1>talked about one of the characteristics</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an excellent leader as somebody who</v>

15
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 1>is a first class no desser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my book on the power of noticing is</v>

16
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:08.511
<v Speaker 1>really an attempt to help MBA students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>executives to become firstclass noticers</v>

17
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 1>so that they can be aware of problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges,</v>

18
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>and opportunities that would allow them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be more effective.</v>

19
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.750
<v Speaker 1>The truth is I don't consider myself to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a particularly effective notice.</v>

20
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been working on it a lot in the</v>

21
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>last dozen years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.210
<v Speaker 1>but I always took pride in my ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>focus as opposed to my ability to</v>

23
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of us who focus very,</v>

24
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>very effectively might want to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the question of whether they can</v>

25
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:44.070
<v Speaker 1>develop the skills of noticing to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with their skills of focusing.</v>

26
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>A number of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 1>I had an opportunity to notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>and I failed to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's been an obsession with me ever</v>

29
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On march 10 2005,</v>

30
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>I was hired by the u s department of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justice and a landmark case that they</v>

31
00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:01.440
<v Speaker 1>were fighting against the tobacco</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

32
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I was hired as a remedy witness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

33
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>I was hired to provide recommendations</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the court about what the penalty</v>

34
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:14.211
<v Speaker 1>would be if in fact the department of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justice succeeded in its trial against</v>

35
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:15.630
<v Speaker 1>the tobacco industry.</v>

36
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>I'd spend a couple of hundred hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>working for the Department of Justice,</v>

37
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>including submitting my written direct</v>
<v Speaker 1>testimony,</v>

38
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.760
<v Speaker 1>which had been submitted to the court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was scheduled to be understand on May</v>

39
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.820
<v Speaker 1>4th where um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tobacco industry attorneys would be</v>

40
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:39.831
<v Speaker 1>asking you a series of questions on</v>
<v Speaker 1>April 30th a number of days before my</v>

41
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:45.030
<v Speaker 1>May 4th testimony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Washington dc to be to meet</v>

42
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:50.031
<v Speaker 1>with Department of Justice attorneys to</v>
<v Speaker 1>prepare for my time on the stand when</v>

43
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>the day started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Department of Justice Attorney that</v>

44
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>I had been working with said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Bays Herman,</v>

45
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 1>this occurred long after he had learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>to call me Max.</v>

46
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>You said Professor Bays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Department of Justice requests that</v>

47
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>you amend your testimony to note that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the testimony would not be relevant if</v>

48
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>any of the following four conditions</v>
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>

49
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.980
<v Speaker 1>He then read to me for legal conditions</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't understand when he was</v>

50
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>done talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said to him,</v>

51
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>why would you ask me to amend my</v>
<v Speaker 1>testimony when you know that I didn't</v>

52
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>understand what you just said to me?</v>

53
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>And his response was because if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't agree,</v>

54
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>there's a significant chance that senior</v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership in the Department of Justice</v>

55
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.910
<v Speaker 1>will remove you from the case before you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are on the stand on May 4th to which I</v>

56
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

57
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree to those changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his response was,</v>

58
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's continue with your preparation.</v>

59
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>I was jarred by the fact that something</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange had occurred,</v>

60
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>but I was overwhelmed in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to help this case and I</v>

61
00:03:56.201 --> 00:04:01.201
<v Speaker 1>didn't quite know what had occurred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to this day I'm critical of the fact</v>

62
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:07.021
<v Speaker 1>that they took no action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did appear on trial on May 4th and the</v>

63
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:13.201
<v Speaker 1>trial ended in early June,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on June 17th I woke up in a hotel</v>

64
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 1>room in London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was working with another client at the</v>

65
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:22.171
<v Speaker 1>time and they woke up early at 5:00 AM</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I opened up the New York Times Web</v>

66
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 1>web edition and I read a story about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt Myers,</v>

67
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>the president of tobacco free kids who</v>
<v Speaker 1>had come forward to the media with</v>

68
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 1>evidence about how Robert Mccallum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number two official in the</v>

69
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Department of Justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was involved in attempting to get him to</v>

70
00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:42.550
<v Speaker 1>change his testimony.</v>

71
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 1>And I then read basically the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>account that I had experienced back on</v>

72
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:52.411
<v Speaker 1>April 30th Matt Myers had the insight to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that he should do something with</v>

73
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:58.381
<v Speaker 1>this information about what had occurred</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the attempt to tamper with</v>

74
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 1>his testimony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at that point it was straight</v>

75
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:07.261
<v Speaker 1>forward to come forward to the media to</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak to congressional representatives</v>

76
00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 1>about what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my own role received media attention</v>

77
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to this day I'm still struck by the</v>

78
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:19.531
<v Speaker 1>fact that I didn't come forward on April</v>
<v Speaker 1>30th when in the back of my mind I knew</v>

79
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Speaker 1>something had occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I tell you this story is</v>

80
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>because I think a lot of our fail you</v>
<v Speaker 1>did notice happens when we're busy.</v>

81
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 1>It happens when we don't know exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happened,</v>

82
00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:34.980
<v Speaker 1>what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's our job as the</v>

83
00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 1>executives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as leaders,</v>

84
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>as professionals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to act when we're pretty sure that</v>

85
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:44.740
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's our job to notice and to not simply</v>

86
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 1>be passive when we can't quite figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the evidence.</v>

87
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.070
<v Speaker 1>It's our job to to take steps to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what's going on and to act on,</v>

88
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.390
<v Speaker 1>on critical information.</v>

89
00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
