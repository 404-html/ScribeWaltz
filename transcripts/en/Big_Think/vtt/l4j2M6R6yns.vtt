1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.430
<v Speaker 2>they certainly voted cover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they exist since 2000 years and they</v>

3
00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:17.970
<v Speaker 2>have a very strong message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.550
<v Speaker 2>but</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't deserve to recover soon</v>

5
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.750
<v Speaker 2>unless they really accept the guilt that</v>
<v Speaker 2>some individuals loaded on themselves</v>

6
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 2>and the institution has to learn that</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps the conditions under which</v>

7
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 2>priests work are conducive to certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>misbehavior.</v>

8
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.490
<v Speaker 2>So maybe the conditions will have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed.</v>

9
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 2>This has been the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a indeed so close reformation by Martin</v>

10
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Luther and others at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Catholic Church was it in a much</v>

11
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.430
<v Speaker 2>worse state of affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much with much more guilt in that sense.</v>

12
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Then today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it has a kind of led to a</v>

13
00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:16.850
<v Speaker 2>purification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

14
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.950
<v Speaker 2>the challenge from the reformation from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reformation has led the Catholics to</v>

15
00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:24.820
<v Speaker 2>learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from luther and others.</v>

16
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.540
<v Speaker 2>So now they are almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>undistinguishable.</v>
