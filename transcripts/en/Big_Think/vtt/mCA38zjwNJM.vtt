1
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.550
<v Speaker 1>So Connor and I were in India.</v>

2
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.500
<v Speaker 2>We had flown there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were meeting with their judicial,</v>

3
00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:16.330
<v Speaker 2>with the judges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have their supreme court.</v>

4
00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:19.270
<v Speaker 2>We arrived on that very day on that very</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

5
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that were horrified and there was</v>

6
00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:27.250
<v Speaker 2>a tremendous outpouring of support and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people couldn't have been nicer.</v>

7
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.370
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a time for a thought.</v>

8
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.850
<v Speaker 2>And really it seemed to me the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

9
00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:35.890
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mentioned it because,</v>

10
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was in our minds after a week</v>

11
00:00:40.781 --> 00:00:41.980
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we spent a week there,</v>

12
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the world is really divided into</v>

13
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.340
<v Speaker 2>the f.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I think of is the forces of reason</v>

14
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.950
<v Speaker 2>and the forces of non reason and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>forces of reason.</v>

15
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>law is part of that law as part of it.</v>

16
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Judges are part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lawyers are part of it.</v>

17
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 2>And so is everybody else on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

18
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.770
<v Speaker 2>other professions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the forces of non reason,</v>

19
00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:06.430
<v Speaker 2>that's the risk.</v>

20
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.730
<v Speaker 2>That's the danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I rather see that as a,</v>

21
00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:13.210
<v Speaker 2>as a something that's unifying people</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the world.</v>

22
00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:17.200
<v Speaker 2>Because people across the world do</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in democratic systems.</v>

23
00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:19.630
<v Speaker 2>They do believe in protecting basic</v>
<v Speaker 2>human rights.</v>

24
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

25
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.740
<v Speaker 2>they do believe in drawing to create</v>
<v Speaker 2>economies that will be,</v>

26
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.590
<v Speaker 2>make their people prosperous and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

27
00:01:26.591 --> 00:01:30.610
<v Speaker 2>they believe to a considerable degree in</v>
<v Speaker 2>international settlement of disputes,</v>

28
00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:34.000
<v Speaker 2>things like that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but therefore says that they have to</v>

29
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:35.560
<v Speaker 2>fight against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are obvious.</v>

30
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.740
<v Speaker 2>So that's in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's how I was brought up to,</v>

31
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was after World War II and efforts at</v>

32
00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:48.040
<v Speaker 2>cooperation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I as you look out today,</v>

33
00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:53.041
<v Speaker 2>but also I'd say my experience tells me</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in a way it's like this sort of</v>

34
00:01:53.141 --> 00:01:55.150
<v Speaker 2>somebody weaving allume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

35
00:01:55.151 --> 00:01:59.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a political figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in politics and I don't,</v>

36
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.041
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

37
00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:04.060
<v Speaker 2>and people who do are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are in politics and in very high levels</v>

38
00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:07.600
<v Speaker 2>in government may see these</v>
<v Speaker 2>international institutions and global</v>

39
00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:09.730
<v Speaker 2>politics going on at a very high level.</v>

40
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 2>But I say to the lawyers and judges were</v>
<v Speaker 2>technical people were professionals and</v>

41
00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:17.530
<v Speaker 2>at our level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever happens at the other,</v>

42
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.330
<v Speaker 2>there is a kind of knitting going off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like workers at allume.</v>

43
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.300
<v Speaker 2>It's happening in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's happening in Africa,</v>

44
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.830
<v Speaker 2>it's happening in Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are learning from each other,</v>

45
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.500
<v Speaker 2>particularly in law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does it happen?</v>

46
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.950
<v Speaker 2>It happens at conferences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People talk to each other,</v>

47
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.010
<v Speaker 2>judges talk to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lawyers talk to each other.</v>

48
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.670
<v Speaker 2>It happens as different groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to create laws.</v>

49
00:02:42.671 --> 00:02:45.190
<v Speaker 2>For example in Europe they are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

50
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.340
<v Speaker 2>create commercial laws and bankruptcy</v>
<v Speaker 2>laws and tax laws and laws that will</v>

51
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 2>govern several what were independent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are independent nations but they're</v>

52
00:02:54.851 --> 00:02:57.160
<v Speaker 2>trying to get together and this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>

53
00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 2>say the World Trade Organization</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening across the world.</v>

54
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 2>It's popularly called globalization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what it involves or people in</v>

55
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in law learning what each other</v>

56
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 2>are doing and they adjust their laws</v>
<v Speaker 2>accordingly.</v>

57
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't always have to be formal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to have a group called the</v>

58
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 2>uniform law commissioners and they go</v>
<v Speaker 2>from state to state and they'd say,</v>

59
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 2>California does this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go to Iowa and they say,</v>

60
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:22.931
<v Speaker 2>Iowa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

61
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 2>California does this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you should try it.</v>

62
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of thing goes on every</v>
<v Speaker 2>minute as we speak.</v>

63
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.470
<v Speaker 2>And then there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

64
00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 2>there are different organizations</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing,</v>

65
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the World Trade Organization or,</v>

66
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 2>or there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are dozens of them there.</v>

67
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 2>They're free trade areas are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

68
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:45.301
<v Speaker 2>there are a health organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are communications organizations,</v>

69
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 2>there's the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are all these things we know</v>

70
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are all forces working to bring us</v>

71
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I see as happening,</v>

72
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 2>and it's not a political matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I see is happening is people who</v>

73
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:03.610
<v Speaker 2>are lawyers and judges in America today</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be aware and they have to have a</v>

74
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 2>system for being aware of what's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on elsewhere because of the cases in</v>

75
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 2>front of them will more and more depend</v>
<v Speaker 2>on what's happened.</v>

76
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
