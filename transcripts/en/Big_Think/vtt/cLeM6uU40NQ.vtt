1
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Women entrepreneurs currently are</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting about 2.5% of all venture</v>

2
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>capital and it's not the only source of</v>
<v Speaker 1>funding,</v>

3
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's a really great indicator of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fare in space.</v>

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's a fairly commonly understood</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistic.</v>

5
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Speaker 1>But the statistic that I like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>feature,</v>

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>which is the one that nobody ever talks</v>
<v Speaker 1>about is what percentage of funding is</v>

7
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:29.040
<v Speaker 1>actually going to women of color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.940
<v Speaker 1>and that's a much more dismal number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually depending on what study</v>

9
00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's between 0.1% or 0.2% which is to</v>

10
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:41.721
<v Speaker 1>say that women of color and companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>founded by women of color aren't really</v>

11
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>even statistically relevant at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

12
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>The fact that women of color and</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies founded by women of color</v>

13
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:53.091
<v Speaker 1>don't really even play in the space is</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly jarring if you think about</v>

14
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>the fact that most companies in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country are actually founded by women of</v>

15
00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>color.</v>

16
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's bad that we're not getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>funding,</v>

17
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's particularly bad given that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be the source of innovation.</v>

18
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>And probably the most entrepreneurial</v>
<v Speaker 1>community of all venture capital is,</v>

19
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.730
<v Speaker 1>I often call it like the house flipping</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of investments,</v>

20
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like house flipping shows.</v>

21
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:18.870
<v Speaker 1>It has become the most popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most visible,</v>

22
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 1>the most sort of prolific version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>investing that's out there or even of</v>

23
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>capital sources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's way more to the world of</v>

24
00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>investing and of securing capital than</v>
<v Speaker 1>just venture capital,</v>

25
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's long view investments,</v>

26
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>there's debt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's crowd funding.</v>

27
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 1>There are many different options when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to getting funding,</v>

28
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:38.760
<v Speaker 1>but the one that dominates the headlines</v>
<v Speaker 1>is venture capital.</v>

29
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 1>You get to be on the cover of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you secured a big series a,</v>

30
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>you don't really get a whole lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>price when you've secured a line of</v>

31
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>credit or alone.</v>

32
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 1>It's just not perceived as sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet companies need debt in order to</v>

33
00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Companies that are women led tend to be</v>

34
00:01:57.091 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>more successful at getting crowdfunding</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars than they are at getting venture</v>

35
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>capital dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in these areas of funding that don't</v>

36
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>get a lot of publicity or actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>really critical because they are doing a</v>

37
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:09.780
<v Speaker 1>better job of servicing women owned</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses.</v>

38
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the thing that I always tell</v>

39
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:15.960
<v Speaker 1>founders is that vc might be for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might not be,</v>

40
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.780
<v Speaker 1>but let's not romanticize what it is and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it works.</v>

41
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Please do not take venture capital from</v>
<v Speaker 1>any investor no matter what terms are</v>

42
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:25.350
<v Speaker 1>giving you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're willing to be fired from</v>

43
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:27.360
<v Speaker 1>your own company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was what happens to a lot of</v>

44
00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>people who end up taking venture</v>
<v Speaker 1>capital.</v>

45
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.880
<v Speaker 1>The bottom line for me is that there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>many different sources of capital.</v>

46
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a one size fits all regime and</v>

47
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:40.970
<v Speaker 1>we get fed one single product and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is,</v>

48
00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:44.520
<v Speaker 1>is a smart founder has to look around to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what their other options are.</v>

49
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.990
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that this is not just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice to have this as a critical,</v>

50
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>critical thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that I worry</v>

51
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a hack in my book,</v>

52
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that comes from an amazing investor</v>

53
00:02:56.791 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>called dawn Rayvon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he talks in the book about how he</v>

54
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>knows how this movie's going to end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this idea that we don't have</v>

55
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>enough women and people of color getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

56
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I'm worried about and what he's</v>

57
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 1>worried about is that in 10 years we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to look back at the statistics and</v>

58
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>we're going to see that we had too many</v>
<v Speaker 1>women and people of color excepting</v>

59
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>blindly horrible terms and horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>venture capital packages.</v>

60
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>And in 10 years when we look back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that going to produce?</v>

61
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>It's going to produce a whole series and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even a whole generation of</v>

62
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs that were just</v>
<v Speaker 1>proportionately more likely to fail.</v>

63
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>And I worry that in 10 years when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>look back at a statistic like that,</v>

64
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.820
<v Speaker 1>people aren't going to blame an</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbalanced capital stock.</v>

65
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to blame the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people should have taken debt and they</v>

66
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to look at stats that</v>

67
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>simply say that women and people of</v>
<v Speaker 1>color fail at a greater rate than anyone</v>

68
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want that not to be the end of our</v>

69
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of my favorite alternatives in</v>

70
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>terms of getting funding are things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>loans are things like lines of credits,</v>

71
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are some that are even less</v>

72
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 1>impactful to your business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a little more work,</v>

73
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>but the country is now speckled all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

74
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.250
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of a state that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have competitions that doesn't have</v>

75
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.510
<v Speaker 1>pitch events where you can go spend a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of time and energy and get</v>

76
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 1>money for your company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in those early days because</v>

77
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:23.950
<v Speaker 1>you tell a good story because you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great idea and especially money that</v>

78
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 1>doesn't actually have to require that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you give away equity in your company.</v>

79
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Another one of my favorite sources of</v>
<v Speaker 1>funding is a crowdfunding and there are</v>

80
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:34.090
<v Speaker 1>a couple different kinds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

81
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 1>There's crowdfunding where you give</v>
<v Speaker 1>people t shirts,</v>

82
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>are you pre sell whatever product you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to manufacturer.</v>

83
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.890
<v Speaker 1>In that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not giving up any equity.</v>

84
00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 1>You're giving people goodwill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're giving people product,</v>

85
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:46.810
<v Speaker 1>you're giving people a sneak preview</v>
<v Speaker 1>into what you're working on.</v>

86
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.360
<v Speaker 1>And in exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting meaningful capital.</v>

87
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Women tend to be disproportionately more</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful at crowdfunding campaigns.</v>

88
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are different studies that say why</v>

89
00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:58.230
<v Speaker 1>that might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suspect that it's because their</v>

90
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 1>social networks are strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also suspect it's because we're</v>

91
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:05.740
<v Speaker 1>shut out of other forms of capital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also equity crowd funding,</v>

92
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 1>or you are actually giving a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your company away,</v>

93
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.420
<v Speaker 1>much like you're doing with venture</v>
<v Speaker 1>capital.</v>

94
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 1>But in the equity crowdfunding space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terms tend to be better,</v>

95
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>so you're not giving away as much and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not giving away nearly as much</v>

96
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:18.424
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

97
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
