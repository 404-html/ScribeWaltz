1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to write about what it means that</v>

2
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:10.170
<v Speaker 1>some people see me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to earn or have to do</v>

3
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>something to deserve access to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things that we think about is basic</v>

4
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 1>necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how hard can you work to earn access</v>

5
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:20.940
<v Speaker 1>to a meal every night or like earn or</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you have to do to deserve a good</v>

6
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:23.820
<v Speaker 1>education?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you have to do to deserve to</v>

7
00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>have housing and that's one of the ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>that race sort of works in this country</v>

8
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 1>is that there's some people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>deemed inherently worthy.</v>

9
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>So we think about the way whiteness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>white supremacy people are just deemed</v>

10
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:35.040
<v Speaker 1>white people are just deemed worthy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

11
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>but there's this notion that you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work extra hard to deserve a great</v>

12
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>public education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am from Baltimore and we think about</v>

13
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:44.340
<v Speaker 1>the school system in Baltimore City is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not funded equitably at all and it's</v>

14
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:44.551
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

15
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 1>what do those kids have to do to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>earn equitable funding?</v>

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>They actually don't need to do anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>besides just be alive and one of the</v>

17
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>things that we need to do is make sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we set up a system where people</v>

18
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>just have the basic necessities like</v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

19
00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

20
00:00:57.751 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>We can guarantee that there's no reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we don't have it here.</v>

21
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Speaker 1>So I actually think about the diversity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and equality and equity,</v>

22
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The equality is everybody gets the same</v>

23
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Equity is that people get what they need</v>

24
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 1>and deserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the worker justice,</v>

25
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>we are almost always fighting for</v>
<v Speaker 1>equity.</v>

26
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>So we think about things like school</v>
<v Speaker 1>funding.</v>

27
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>We are not asking for equal funding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that it just costs more to</v>

28
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>educate kids who grew up in poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It costs more to educate kids with</v>

29
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>special needs and we know that we need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pay that cost,</v>

30
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:25.920
<v Speaker 1>that those kids deserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That we're not saying that every kid,</v>

31
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it costs the same to educate every kid.</v>

32
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>That's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want a world of equity where people</v>

33
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>get what they need and deserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know the disparities around criminal</v>

34
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are disparities around race</v>

35
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>and we want an equitable system that</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't penalize people for where they</v>

36
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they show up,</v>

37
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>what zip code they come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the difference between equity and</v>

38
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:47.260
<v Speaker 1>equality as an important distinction and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way to get to equality equality</v>

39
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>and access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how whatever metric of equality you want</v>

40
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>is by having equity of resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

41
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Equity of experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the equity pieces that you need</v>

42
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:57.990
<v Speaker 1>something different and you deserve</v>
<v Speaker 1>something different.</v>

43
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 1>And from a system level I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that you have access to that.</v>

44
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 1>So I was talking to somebody about about</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's named Swanson a and she was like,</v>

45
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 1>people should have to work for food</v>
<v Speaker 1>stamps because if they work for it</v>

46
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.810
<v Speaker 1>though dignity and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.330
<v Speaker 1>not eating.</v>

48
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pretty addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like not having food is a lack of</v>

49
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 1>dignity right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

50
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:19.290
<v Speaker 1>That like food is one of those basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

51
00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>We have enough food that we can beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

52
00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>We have enough water to everybody can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 1>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a meal at three meals every single day.</v>

54
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Like we can guarantee those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to artificially create</v>

55
00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>this requirement that people like work</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they can earn food,</v>

56
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:36.630
<v Speaker 1>like we can actually guarantee these</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic things for people,</v>

57
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one of the things that we have to do</v>

58
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>as we fight for social justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as talk about these things as basic as</v>

59
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:44.710
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

60
00:02:44.711 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>it's not radical to believe that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in a world with the police.</v>

61
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Don't kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not radical to say that every kid</v>

62
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>should be able to read and write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not radical or extreme to say that</v>

63
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 1>we can feed every single person every</v>
<v Speaker 1>single day.</v>

64
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.750
<v Speaker 1>That the only radical thing about it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have to say in the first place</v>

65
00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is actually where the radical part</v>

66
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

67
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>I think about that because polarization</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrives in a world of extremes.</v>

68
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>And so often people want to paint our</v>
<v Speaker 1>positions is extreme.</v>

69
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>It's an extreme position to say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there should be equity advantage.</v>

70
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>That's not extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The extreme thing about it is that we</v>

71
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>don't have it right now and that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>defined for it.</v>

72
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>I was in a meeting once and we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about welfare and it was people</v>

73
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:24.840
<v Speaker 1>from the right and the left and one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>her sort of,</v>

74
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>there was a person in it who was sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>against welfare and her push was like,</v>

75
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people need to,</v>

76
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>people need to like earn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People need to work hard for it and if</v>

77
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>they work hard for it they'll feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>better and it's like A.</v>

78
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people like have already</v>

79
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>worked hard to like get a meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people being alive,</v>

80
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>it's like enough of that and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people who feel like they just</v>

81
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>deserve everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like.</v>

82
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>One of the ways that white supremacy</v>
<v Speaker 1>works is that people really do feel like</v>

83
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 1>they've already earned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put in the hard work,</v>

84
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>they've done something or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

85
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 1>all the things that they get are</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the benefits of their hard</v>

86
00:03:57.281 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about the way wealth works in</v>

87
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 1>this country is that in 2023,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the median wealth for black people's</v>

88
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>gonna be $0.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lowest recorded.</v>

89
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.110
<v Speaker 1>It's since you've been recording about</v>
<v Speaker 1>them this way and you didn't go to the</v>

90
00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>median wealth of $0 and you think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>white wealth,</v>

91
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:12.630
<v Speaker 1>which is will be around $100,000 in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>medium.</v>

92
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Black walls will be zero.</v>

93
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like why people like worked</v>

94
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 1>hard for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like white people,</v>

95
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 1>like every white person was like some</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur that like did all these</v>

96
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:23.350
<v Speaker 1>wealth building things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government literally gave white</v>

97
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

98
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 1>the government gave white people housing</v>
<v Speaker 1>loans for very little with very little</v>

99
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 1>interest in government gave white people</v>
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>

100
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 1>The highway administration created the</v>
<v Speaker 1>suburbs and you think about what it</v>

101
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:38.700
<v Speaker 1>means that the government gave people a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave white people like education in</v>

102
00:04:38.701 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 1>mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those things contributed to white</v>

103
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:42.480
<v Speaker 1>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are.</v>

104
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.260
<v Speaker 1>People were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked really hard and say,</v>

105
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.800
<v Speaker 1>how hard did you work for a system that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like benefits your skin colored</v>

106
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 1>every turn of the way you didn't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

107
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:53.410
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How hard did you work for every band aid</v>

108
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:56.230
<v Speaker 1>to look like you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How hard did you work for nude to be the</v>

109
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 1>color of your skin and not mine?</v>

110
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Like you didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A system did that and like that.</v>

111
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 1>You benefit from the system and part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work of white people is to</v>

112
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>understand the privilege of whiteness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to understand how a system provided</v>

113
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:11.050
<v Speaker 1>that and work to dismantle it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually is dangerous a teacher.</v>

114
00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 1>So there's a study that came out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the first time measures,</v>

115
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 1>how meritocracy impacts middle schoolers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like a seventh grade in seventh</v>

116
00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:23.761
<v Speaker 1>grade kids and it shows that kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually kids of color do worse later if</v>

117
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>they believe that meritocracy is like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real thing because the systems are to</v>

118
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 1>bear down on them in hallways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that it's a result of like</v>

119
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.530
<v Speaker 1>dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not working hard,</v>

120
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.581
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

121
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 1>we know that the way systemic racism</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows up later like means that no matter</v>

122
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>how gifted you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how great you are,</v>

123
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.440
<v Speaker 1>the outcome still just aren't the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know what the criminal justice here</v>

124
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.030
<v Speaker 1>you think about New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that 90 percent of the people arrested</v>

125
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 1>for marijuana are black and brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I both know that the 90 percent</v>

126
00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:53.290
<v Speaker 1>of the people in New York City smoking</v>
<v Speaker 1>weed or not black or brown.</v>

127
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:55.720
<v Speaker 1>When we think about the arrests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think about disparities in education.</v>

128
00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>The meritocracy causes people to blame</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves for outcomes and not</v>

129
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 1>realizing that the system is almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>guaranteeing instead of outcomes.</v>
