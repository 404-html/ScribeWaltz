1
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are complex issues that have</v>

2
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.970
<v Speaker 1>technical components,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technological components,</v>

3
00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:20.971
<v Speaker 1>scientific components to their solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but none of these things happen if we</v>

4
00:00:21.741 --> 00:00:26.720
<v Speaker 1>don't have the understanding through</v>
<v Speaker 1>society what needs to be done if we</v>

5
00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:31.721
<v Speaker 1>don't have the political and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and national well to take the steps that</v>

6
00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:36.881
<v Speaker 1>we have to take if we don't innovate in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way in which we organize work as</v>

7
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:39.290
<v Speaker 1>well as organized science and</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

8
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.800
<v Speaker 1>It all has to work together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd like to believe that despite the</v>

9
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:50.420
<v Speaker 1>fact that we look at these things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at globalization as daunting</v>

10
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:53.930
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really terrific opportunities.</v>

11
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>And at this point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no nation on the face of the globe has a</v>

12
00:00:59.871 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>better hand to play in the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

13
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we are still the best,</v>

14
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly at the cutting edge and</v>

15
00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:11.540
<v Speaker 1>science and technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're dramatically challenged by other</v>

16
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:12.980
<v Speaker 1>countries as we should be.</v>

17
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>We're still the best and unlike much of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

18
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.330
<v Speaker 1>we build what we do on these remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 1>substrates of a diverse population and a</v>

19
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>democracy and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.040
<v Speaker 1>an open market system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe we've got the best</v>

21
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.230
<v Speaker 1>possibilities in the world of helping to</v>
<v Speaker 1>resolve these problems and providing</v>

22
00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:39.620
<v Speaker 1>leadership and having prosperity in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

23
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.020
<v Speaker 1>but we can't do it if we don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>core science and technology.</v>

24
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.820
<v Speaker 1>If we don't have young men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're going to be signed,</v>

25
00:01:49.821 --> 00:01:53.540
<v Speaker 1>the stress engineers or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't have young men and women who</v>

26
00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:58.430
<v Speaker 1>have some technological literacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some quantitative skills,</v>

27
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.040
<v Speaker 1>some understanding of the world at</v>
<v Speaker 1>large,</v>

28
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.480
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to be in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the basic answer to your question is</v>

29
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.750
<v Speaker 1>technology alone can never solve these</v>
<v Speaker 1>large scale problems.</v>

30
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.300
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't solve them without it.</v>
