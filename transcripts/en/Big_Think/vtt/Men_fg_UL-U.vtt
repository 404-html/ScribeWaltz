00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.160
<v Speaker 1>So last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fascinating study came out in the</v>

2
00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:04.460
<v Speaker 1>journal Science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.180
<v Speaker 1>from a team led by Betsy Sparrow at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbia.</v>

4
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>And in the study those scientists showed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people who used Google and who</v>

5
00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:18.730
<v Speaker 1>thought that they would be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>access information on a computer later</v>

6
00:00:18.731 --> 00:00:22.630
<v Speaker 1>on didn't remember it as well as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who didn't think they would have</v>

7
00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:27.460
<v Speaker 1>access to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have one kind of key variable.</v>

8
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you'll be able to use your</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer later on to find this</v>

9
00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:32.230
<v Speaker 1>information?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is no.</v>

10
00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:35.020
<v Speaker 1>You're going to remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the answer is yes,</v>

11
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.640
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you will remember where to find it.</v>

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.020
<v Speaker 1>So you'll remember where it was stored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll remember what the folder was,</v>

13
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.570
<v Speaker 1>you remember how to access it on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

14
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.790
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that you're not remembering</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

15
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.440
<v Speaker 1>it's at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're remembering a very different</v>

16
00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:51.040
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

17
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Do you use your memory to store the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual piece of information?</v>

18
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you use it to store the retrieval</v>
<v Speaker 1>process?</v>

19
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>So I take a few things from this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.300
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One technology can be very bad for our</v>

21
00:01:04.301 --> 00:01:09.301
<v Speaker 1>memory if we let it be bad for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we always rely on it,</v>

22
00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:12.160
<v Speaker 1>and if we have this attitude of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

23
00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:15.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to remember this because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll always be able to look it up,</v>

24
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.920
<v Speaker 1>you won't remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you won't have that knowledge</v>

25
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>in your head and then you won't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything in your attic to play with.</v>

26
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.990
<v Speaker 1>You won't have that knowledge base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't be able to be imaginative like</v>

27
00:01:25.991 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 1>homes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't be able to reach those</v>

28
00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:29.980
<v Speaker 1>conclusions because your attic will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty bare.</v>

29
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.670
<v Speaker 1>But we can also use it to enhance our</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory,</v>

30
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by saying,</v>

31
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that there are these great</v>

32
00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:40.840
<v Speaker 1>technological benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't I use that to create this</v>

33
00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>virtual storage space for myself?</v>

34
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.840
<v Speaker 1>So homes does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two homes has files that he accesses and</v>

35
00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:47.651
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watson,</v>

36
00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:49.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look up my file for this case.</v>

37
00:01:49.991 --> 00:01:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Look up my file for this case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he remembers that he has the file.</v>

38
00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:57.160
<v Speaker 1>He remembers that there was a case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't necessarily remember all of</v>

39
00:01:57.161 --> 00:02:01.000
<v Speaker 1>these details.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can think of Google as this</v>

40
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:03.940
<v Speaker 1>vastly expanded Holmesii and filing</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

41
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.290
<v Speaker 1>So you can use it for exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the things that I want to</v>

42
00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:13.291
<v Speaker 1>remember and that I want to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>access later on and focus on remembering</v>

43
00:02:13.301 --> 00:02:17.470
<v Speaker 1>how to access them and then keep your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind space for those things that you</v>

44
00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:20.830
<v Speaker 1>think will be important for you to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>at any point.</v>

45
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.070
<v Speaker 1>So the exercise that I like to say for</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself as if I were on a desert island</v>

46
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.540
<v Speaker 1>with no power or I don't even have to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a desert island in Hurricane Sandy,</v>

47
00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:33.340
<v Speaker 1>I had no power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no Internet,</v>

48
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.590
<v Speaker 1>no cell phone service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

49
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.300
<v Speaker 1>So if hurricane sandy strikes again and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have anything,</v>

50
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.570
<v Speaker 1>do I have everything that I need</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately in my head?</v>

51
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are those things that I really</v>

52
00:02:46.181 --> 00:02:47.860
<v Speaker 1>can't rely on a computer for?</v>

53
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
