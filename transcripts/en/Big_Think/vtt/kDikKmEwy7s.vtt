1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.260
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of a single issue that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.980
<v Speaker 1>democrats should draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>

3
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:06.990
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which American be I usually Democrats</v>

4
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 1>portray America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beautiful a should we say,</v>

5
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't care about American beautiful</v>

6
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get in bed with the oil</v>

7
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>spills and the clear cutters and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain top removal and the people who</v>

8
00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:20.620
<v Speaker 1>want to destroy America's beauty for</v>
<v Speaker 1>profit don't want to portray that value.</v>

9
00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>I taught my kids to sing the song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should probably stick up for it.</v>

10
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which American badge,</v>

11
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.021
<v Speaker 1>which we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

12
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:25.854
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we try.</v>

13
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got,</v>

14
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Statue of Liberty.</v>

15
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>May we just knocked that over a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little mall there,</v>

16
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.800
<v Speaker 1>a little strip mall with Sasha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Used to be so we can join the anti</v>

17
00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:38.740
<v Speaker 1>immigrant crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

18
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.220
<v Speaker 1>the statue says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me your tired.</v>

19
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Give me your poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your huddled masses yearning to breathe</v>

20
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

21
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>If that sentiment was good enough for</v>
<v Speaker 1>our grandparents,</v>

22
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>it should be good enough for our</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren.</v>

23
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>The color of the immigrants might</v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

24
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Our national values should not change</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are a nation of immigrants.</v>

25
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:01.410
<v Speaker 1>We should be respectful of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>contribution of immigrants.</v>

26
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.860
<v Speaker 1>And you cannot be an anti immigrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigot and a Patriot at the same time.</v>

27
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Those are things that don't go together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to give that up.</v>

28
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to give up the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty and justice for all.</v>

29
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

30
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>we believe in liberty and justice for</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

31
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Just not for the gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 1>just leave them out or you're not for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor urban black kids.</v>

33
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Leave them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>

34
00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>we'll give them a justice based on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoodies are wearing rather than based on</v>

35
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:28.290
<v Speaker 1>what they're actually doing is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.920
<v Speaker 1>which American value are we supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>betray?</v>

37
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to betray any of them.</v>

38
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.010
<v Speaker 1>I think we should have liberty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice for all.</v>

39
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.070
<v Speaker 1>I think we should honor honor the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just a statue of liberty as a</v>

40
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as also the substance,</v>

41
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.821
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

42
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>that statue stands for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we should believe in America,</v>

43
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>the beautiful end offend America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not willing to give up any</v>

44
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:51.300
<v Speaker 1>American values to appease people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you gave up those values,</v>

45
00:01:51.301 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>they would move 10 feet 10 more feet to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right.</v>

46
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who</v>

47
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.190
<v Speaker 1>is in public life needs to find out what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they believe in and in public life will</v>

48
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 1>test you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may think you know what you believe</v>

49
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 1>in until you get put over those hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>coals,</v>

50
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.590
<v Speaker 1>the public life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people believe that Americans just</v>

51
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:13.220
<v Speaker 1>as this land of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

52
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

53
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 1>of individuals who have a lot of liberty</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she'd be left alone because how we</v>

54
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>got so great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't find any evidence that that's a</v>

55
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:22.284
<v Speaker 1>true story.</v>

56
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Best I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The American Century,</v>

57
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.360
<v Speaker 1>the last century when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when everybody looks at with such awe</v>

58
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>wasn't built by a bunch of random</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals who didn't care about each</v>

59
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>other and when do anything for each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other and the government that was</v>

60
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>missing in action that was built by us</v>
<v Speaker 1>pooling our resources,</v>

61
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly through government,</v>

62
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>massively investing in infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>public schools and dams and roads and</v>

63
00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>bridges and education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Educating a whole generation of young</v>

64
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>people at a level and scaled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never been done before.</v>

65
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Building a middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had a labor rights and civil rights</v>

66
00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>and women's rights to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>middleclass could include more and more</v>

67
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Making sure that we were no longer</v>

68
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>poisoning the air and the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking care of our children,</v>

69
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>making sure that industry wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>poisoned,</v>

70
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>killing our kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what made this great American</v>

71
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:12.000
<v Speaker 1>century that everybody's so off.</v>

72
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just individual liberty or</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a market economic performance.</v>

73
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Lots of countries care about economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth,</v>

74
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>but they have no environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>protections in the labor standards.</v>

75
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>That's not America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>America is a great country because we</v>

76
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>perform well economically and meet those</v>
<v Speaker 1>standards,</v>

77
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>but also we meet high environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>standards and high consumer protection</v>

78
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:36.480
<v Speaker 1>standards and high civil rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Labor inclusions.</v>

79
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're a worldclass across the board.</v>

80
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>That's why people want to come here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just because we got to hire a big</v>

81
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>GNP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have great gmp and have people</v>

82
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:48.361
<v Speaker 1>working as wet shops and have water and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the air poison that's not America and so</v>

83
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.970
<v Speaker 1>when you look at that as the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>country that we are,</v>

84
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to defend that.</v>

85
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to defend my parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>achievements.</v>

86
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to defend my grandparents</v>
<v Speaker 1>achievements.</v>

87
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to let people take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrecking ball painted red,</v>

88
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:06.964
<v Speaker 1>white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and blue,</v>

89
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>and smashed down every American</v>
<v Speaker 1>achievement for the last century and</v>

90
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>call that patriotism.</v>

91
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 1>In my view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not patriotism in my view.</v>

92
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Patriotism and frankly being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative would mean you would</v>

93
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 1>conserve the achievements of our parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our grandparents.</v>

94
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 1>They achieved the American Century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American middle class,</v>

95
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:25.350
<v Speaker 1>the American way of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It includes a,</v>

96
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>an appropriately active government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also includes a dynamic private</v>

97
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>sector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also includes community</v>

98
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>

99
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:38.580
<v Speaker 1>but all of those together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just free markets and and,</v>

100
00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

101
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 1>and starved this America's government so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't do its job.</v>

102
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 1>And so we have a responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

103
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>to go forward and stand up for what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in.</v>

104
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Whether we're running for office like</v>
<v Speaker 1>some are or whether we're not like</v>

105
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a responsibility to defend the</v>

106
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:54.210
<v Speaker 1>America that we inherited and to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that,</v>

107
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.670
<v Speaker 1>that people calling themselves patriots</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't smash them.</v>
