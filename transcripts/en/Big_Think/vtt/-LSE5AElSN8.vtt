1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Technology is no longer something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just restricted to large companies or</v>

2
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>large countries or even rich countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everywhere,</v>

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the planet and now as access,</v>

4
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least has the potential to have</v>

5
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 1>access to technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People in developing economies often own</v>

6
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>smart phones and technologies at</v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent rates to people in the</v>

7
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>developed world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite often they'll have that before</v>

9
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 1>they even have sanitation in some cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the p the pervasive nature of</v>

10
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>technology is one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>features of it.</v>

11
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.030
<v Speaker 1>The other important features,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the rate and pace that rich a</v>

12
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>adoption is actually occurring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

13
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>just to put some comparative numbers on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

14
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>if you think about television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took something like 38 years before</v>

15
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Penate penetration got to the first 50</v>

16
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

17
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>it took twitter nine months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

18
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.720
<v Speaker 1>so just the rate of acceleration or</v>
<v Speaker 1>reach adoption occurs.</v>

19
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.830
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

20
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.600
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the other feature that becomes</v>

21
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>very interesting about technology is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just its pace and scale and the rate of</v>

22
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the economic aspects of technology.</v>

23
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:13.011
<v Speaker 1>So when you have things in digital form</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually has a profound impact on</v>

24
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>how it affects the economics of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So digital technologies have this</v>

25
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>feature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.160
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

27
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economists think of it as the nun</v>

28
00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 1>rivalry and not exclude excluded ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

29
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Speaker 1>What that means is that my use of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's in digital form doesn't</v>

30
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:32.130
<v Speaker 1>necessarily as a physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technological Matta preclude your use of</v>

31
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:34.980
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good news about that is that from a</v>

32
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:38.510
<v Speaker 1>user standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all good because it's what</v>

33
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.680
<v Speaker 1>economists talk about it as consumer</v>
<v Speaker 1>surplus.</v>

34
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that he doesn't cost us that</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more to get access to information</v>

35
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>where there's educational material and</v>
<v Speaker 1>attainment material,</v>

36
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all good for us is as,</v>

37
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>as consumers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it puts you challenges for</v>

38
00:01:55.081 --> 00:02:00.081
<v Speaker 1>companies because now you have to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how do you generate revenues and</v>

39
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>monetize this.</v>

40
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>We've seen how technology has caused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>with these marginal costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>

42
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.590
<v Speaker 1>disruptions in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

43
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many industries where this,</v>

44
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:11.640
<v Speaker 1>the media world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entertainment world.</v>

45
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>So it has these disruptive effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for users is generally good in the</v>

46
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>sense that it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.610
<v Speaker 1>useful information that you get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>investments in,</v>

48
00:02:21.611 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>in technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure and technology assets is</v>

49
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>now pervasive across every sector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's we're talking health care</v>

50
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>or we're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>the public sector or talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>education or we talk about industrial.</v>

52
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.120
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the more exciting things about in</v>

53
00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>the industrial area arena is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody now refers to as the Internet</v>

54
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:48.531
<v Speaker 1>of things that for the first time we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>now going to be connecting a machines,</v>

55
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>centers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical things of any sort a that we</v>

56
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's going to have a huge and</v>

57
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:58.200
<v Speaker 1>profound impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think about all the machine to</v>

58
00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>machine interactions.</v>

59
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Think about the possibility for how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage our use of energy,</v>

60
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>how we manage our homes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we manage these settings with as to</v>

61
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>workspace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ha the home,</v>

62
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 1>the car when machines and things get in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get connected.</v>

63
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.410
<v Speaker 1>What I find interesting about that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular is what that does to a</v>

64
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.510
<v Speaker 1>questions about industry structure and</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

65
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>I think we always just imagined that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies would compete within their</v>

67
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:29.730
<v Speaker 1>sectors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

68
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>so this idea of these sectors made sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point.</v>

69
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>But when you have technology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology base to assets,</v>

70
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it becomes possible to enter</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

71
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:42.790
<v Speaker 1>many sectors on the base of technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>platforms.</v>

72
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Think about the fact that now we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about Amazon as a computing</v>

73
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>through their cloud services.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the fact that you now have</v>

75
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>alibaba applying for banking licenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the fact that some of the</v>

76
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:56.720
<v Speaker 1>most profound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.490
<v Speaker 1>innovations and transportations are</v>
<v Speaker 1>being done by technology,</v>

78
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Internet companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google and others.</v>

79
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 1>So I think when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens to</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology makes it possible for</v>

81
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 1>participants in competition to come from</v>
<v Speaker 1>often outside the sector.</v>

82
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>So that's one big change to industry</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

83
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Another big change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the industry structure is on the k on</v>

84
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 1>the question of what it takes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>compete.</v>

85
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>So you're now going to see many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many small companies be able to have</v>

86
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:29.401
<v Speaker 1>kind of the power and the access and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential to disrupt sectors that</v>

87
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 1>historically you'd have associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>just large companies.</v>

88
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>So this idea of competition coming from</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the sector,</v>

89
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>outside of the geography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and very often from much smaller</v>

90
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to have a profound</v>

91
00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>impact on the structure of industries in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economy.</v>
