1
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.530
<v Speaker 1>So for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil is played a special role in American</v>

2
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:15.531
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy and military strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oil is a uniquely important commodity in</v>

3
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>global affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an input to everything in our</v>

4
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 1>modern way of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very important for protecting our</v>

5
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:26.601
<v Speaker 1>prosperity and at a certain level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil is essential for a high quality</v>

6
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>military power to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need access to oil.</v>

7
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>And in the Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States was concerned that the</v>

8
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union could interrupt American</v>
<v Speaker 1>access to Persian Gulf oil,</v>

9
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.570
<v Speaker 1>which we needed in order to defend</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

10
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>defend our own interests against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union.</v>

11
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.910
<v Speaker 1>And so we took it on as a military</v>
<v Speaker 1>mission to protect key sources of oil</v>

12
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>supplies around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the Persian Gulf from</v>

13
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>outside interference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from the Soviet Union,</v>

14
00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 1>being able to threaten them now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

15
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.040
<v Speaker 1>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the union hasn't existed.</v>

16
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 1>That particular scenario hasn't posed a</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge for the United States,</v>

17
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.410
<v Speaker 1>but the United States has feared oil is</v>
<v Speaker 1>continuing to play a role in American</v>

18
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 1>foreign and military policy because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States has feared that political</v>

19
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>disruptions in the Middle East internal</v>
<v Speaker 1>instability.</v>

20
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.120
<v Speaker 1>the threat of a extremists</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist Muslim control in the</v>

22
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that came about,</v>

23
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>could pose a threat to American oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplies that especially with hurt our</v>

24
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>prosperity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

25
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:33.090
<v Speaker 1>that they could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could make us poor.</v>

26
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.210
<v Speaker 1>And so we've used a military force to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to,</v>

27
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reduce instability in parts of the</v>

28
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.520
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the Persian Gulf where,</v>

29
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're afraid that instability would</v>

30
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:52.161
<v Speaker 1>threaten global oil markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That policy has both being largely</v>

31
00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary and largely ineffective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

32
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has happened that there was a moment</v>

33
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.600
<v Speaker 1>where it seemed to work very well when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we sent troops in 1992 defend Saudi</v>

34
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Arabia from Saddam Hussein who had just</v>
<v Speaker 1>conquered Kuwait and then we liberated</v>

35
00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Kuwait in the Gulf War but did not</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to attack Iraq.</v>

36
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.830
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.220
<v Speaker 1>the result of this was to maintain</v>
<v Speaker 1>access to Persian Gulf oil to maintain</v>

38
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>the independence of a number of Persian</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gulf oil producers.</v>

39
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.750
<v Speaker 1>And that made sense in a bunch of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

40
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.310
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>since that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've actually become a primary threat</v>

42
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>to stability in the Middle East rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a primary guarantor of stability.</v>

43
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>In the Middle East and that when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>invaded Iraq,</v>

44
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.670
<v Speaker 1>we set in motion a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>events created a much more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

46
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>salient,</v>

47
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.730
<v Speaker 1>a internal stability challenge for many</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries in the,</v>

48
00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:53.910
<v Speaker 1>in the Persian Gulf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

49
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 1>by hardening and militarizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a domestic conflict and a of these</v>

50
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:04.381
<v Speaker 1>countries between Sunnis and Shiites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between different brands of within Sunni</v>

51
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Islam or within shaded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've created internal instability,</v>

52
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

53
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't address very well from outside,</v>

54
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States lacks the detailed</v>

55
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>information to understand and manipulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the politics of these countries.</v>

56
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get manipulated by local actors than</v>

57
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>in a sense makes the instability worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think of it this way in the</v>

58
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we spend a lot of time thinking about</v>

59
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>and studying American politics and</v>
<v Speaker 1>elections,</v>

60
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>but we don't understand American</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics very well,</v>

61
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>even with all of the background cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge we have and understanding of</v>

62
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 1>our own politics.</v>

63
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Nobody expected president trump to rise</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a phenomenon and become president.</v>

64
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand our own politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can we expect to understand and</v>

66
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:52.171
<v Speaker 1>manipulate the politics of faraway</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries in the Persian Gulf where,</v>

67
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know the local person inches?</v>

68
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know the situation on the</v>

69
00:03:57.311 --> 00:03:59.560
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what contributes to</v>

70
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 1>people's political activism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although we can actually be fairly sure</v>

71
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>of one thing that contributes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is they don't like the feeling</v>

72
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>that they're being pushed around by</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside influences like the United</v>

73
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 1>States showing up and telling them what</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

74
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>And so we can create hostility to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States by saying,</v>

75
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're showing up to defend the stability</v>

76
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:23.410
<v Speaker 1>of Middle East oil supplies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can't actually defend Middle East</v>

77
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:26.530
<v Speaker 1>oil supplies from local instability in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East.</v>

78
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we've actually created a lot of</v>

79
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 1>the problems in the oil market.</v>

80
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that said,</v>

81
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 1>the global oil market protects us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we don't actually have to worry as</v>

82
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:44.080
<v Speaker 1>much about that kind of instability in</v>
<v Speaker 1>any particular oil supplier.</v>

83
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>So what happens in the oil market is</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there's a disruption in one country</v>

84
00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 1>of the world that reduces their oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplies,</v>

85
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:55.390
<v Speaker 1>their ability to supply the global</v>
<v Speaker 1>market to supply consumers like us in</v>

86
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:58.630
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there's that kind of a disruption,</v>

87
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 1>other suppliers compensate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So suppliers that aren't comp,</v>

88
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.060
<v Speaker 1>that aren't disrupted see an opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make more money for themselves by</v>

89
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.750
<v Speaker 1>increasing their oil output to</v>
<v Speaker 1>compensate for the fact that one of</v>

90
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:17.080
<v Speaker 1>their competitors has reduced their oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>output.</v>

91
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.030
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a,</v>

92
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya exploded into civil war and then</v>

93
00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 1>us and European intervention rec to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>state institutions of that country and</v>

94
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>made the civil war last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just a few months in 2011 but</v>

95
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:41.041
<v Speaker 1>persist for the last seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such that Libyan oil output is way down</v>

96
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.160
<v Speaker 1>millions of barrels a day down compared</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what it was before 2011 didn't lead</v>

97
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 1>to a huge disruption of the oil market.</v>

98
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Didn't lead to a big price surge for</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumers like the United States.</v>

99
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Because other producers of oil like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia,</v>

100
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 1>like the United Arab Emirates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Mexico,</v>

101
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all around the world increased their</v>

102
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:08.651
<v Speaker 1>output to compensate for the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya was producing less and so the</v>

103
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:13.751
<v Speaker 1>natural market reaction without the US</v>
<v Speaker 1>military doing anything enables</v>

104
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.600
<v Speaker 1>consumers to continue consuming in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>face of political military disruptions</v>

105
00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 1>of the oil market in one country around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

106
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 1>So we don't need to try to use the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American military to protect the oil</v>

107
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 1>markets because the market compensates</v>
<v Speaker 1>for disruptions.</v>

108
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.310
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our track record of using the US</v>

109
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.560
<v Speaker 1>military to protect the oil markets is</v>
<v Speaker 1>lousy.</v>

110
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.890
<v Speaker 1>It often makes the problems worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not better.</v>

111
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.600
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a clear policy adjustment</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States can make to stop using</v>

112
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:49.601
<v Speaker 1>the military for this purpose and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would make Americans safer and continue</v>

113
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Speaker 1>to give us a reliable oil supply.</v>
