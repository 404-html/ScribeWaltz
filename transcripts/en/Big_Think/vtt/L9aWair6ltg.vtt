1
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.920
<v Speaker 2>part of it is blind luck taught us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is blind luck,</v>

3
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really just rewind everything we've said</v>

4
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 2>this interview and you can add blind</v>
<v Speaker 2>luck.</v>

5
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.620
<v Speaker 2>Certainly in my career I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly lucky that we say I was,</v>

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't as good as spin made me look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't as bad as gear made me look</v>

7
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 2>when it failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot of great luck would spin as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well as some good hard work and some</v>

9
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 2>good instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

11
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.350
<v Speaker 2>I think luck is important even in</v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity because people walk in the</v>

12
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 2>door and if they like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call their friends and they walk in</v>

13
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:44.634
<v Speaker 2>the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

14
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you meet somebody randomly and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

15
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 2>why don't you try writing for me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or how would you like to be a</v>

16
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.850
<v Speaker 2>photographer for me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

17
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 2>And it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The environment though to sustain the,</v>

18
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.520
<v Speaker 2>the atmosphere of creativity is you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have the balls to risk doing</v>

19
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 2>something edgy and having it failed.</v>

20
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 2>I used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

21
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 2>my photographers who came to work for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

22
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

23
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 2>I love your portfolio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take pictures that you would put in your</v>

24
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 2>portfolio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do not give me middle of the road</v>

25
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 2>average photography that you think is</v>
<v Speaker 2>safe,</v>

26
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 2>so I'll hire you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again.</v>

27
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got three assignments.</v>

28
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if the first two are crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still get a third.</v>

29
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 2>So in that confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come out and take your pictures because</v>

30
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:30.640
<v Speaker 2>that's the voice I want in the magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say to my right,</v>

31
00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me a safe middle of the road</v>

32
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 2>piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me an edge.</v>

33
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Eps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find the truth.</v>

34
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 2>The truth may not be pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll publish it either way,</v>

35
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:41.880
<v Speaker 2>if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but go out there in the conference.</v>

36
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm still going to hire you unless you</v>
<v Speaker 2>steal from us,</v>

37
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 2>then I'm not going to argue and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

38
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.680
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically one has to foster confidence</v>

39
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 2>amongst one's creative people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nobody less creative,</v>

40
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 2>less confident in the creative field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say that myself is when I'm</v>

41
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's conference anybody on the planet,</v>

42
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:02.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

43
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 2>but you must foster confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People must feel they can actually go</v>

44
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 2>and be artists for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

45
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 2>a lot of editors and publishers don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want artistry.</v>

46
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.550
<v Speaker 2>They want straightforward industrial</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce a product as to fill the space.</v>

47
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 2>Don't upset your advertise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A complaint I have about Conde Nast is</v>

48
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 2>that they are more concerned about not</v>
<v Speaker 2>upsetting their advertisers than they</v>

49
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:27.160
<v Speaker 2>are about delivering a gps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Then we fear will deliver great pieces</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so when New York had those two</v>

51
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 2>exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to foster confidence that</v>

52
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:37.911
<v Speaker 2>people can go out and actually reached</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brass ring in each assignment and</v>

53
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.980
<v Speaker 2>then you get critical and that begets</v>
<v Speaker 2>other creators.</v>
