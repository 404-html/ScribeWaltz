00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.840
<v Speaker 2>support for big thing comes from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Microsoft delivering people ready</v>

3
00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:15.130
<v Speaker 2>enterprise solutions designed to help</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies do more with less details at</v>

4
00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Microsoft.com/people ready.</v>

5
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.370
<v Speaker 3>It's actually more possible to move</v>
<v Speaker 3>market share than it might be in a</v>

6
00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:32.371
<v Speaker 3>normal environment and so being able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have better awareness and being able to</v>

7
00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:36.820
<v Speaker 3>more quickly respond competitively is of</v>
<v Speaker 3>more importance.</v>

8
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Realtime monitoring is a process by</v>
<v Speaker 3>which companies are building business</v>

9
00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:50.491
<v Speaker 3>intelligence to understand in the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a national intelligence agency</v>

10
00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:55.090
<v Speaker 3>would what is actually going on in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground on the ground in different parts</v>

11
00:00:55.091 --> 00:00:56.890
<v Speaker 3>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in different parts of their business</v>

12
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.170
<v Speaker 3>that allows them to more quickly respond</v>
<v Speaker 3>to changes in the external economic</v>

13
00:01:02.171 --> 00:01:03.820
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to competitive moves,</v>

14
00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:08.821
<v Speaker 3>to changes in the financial markets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to changes in prices and reactions of</v>

15
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 3>different moves that they're making so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they can have an awareness of how</v>

16
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.410
<v Speaker 3>each of those changes may influence what</v>
<v Speaker 3>their business response should be and</v>

17
00:01:20.411 --> 00:01:21.670
<v Speaker 3>more quickly adapt to them.</v>

18
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.950
<v Speaker 3>Even before the crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

19
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.220
<v Speaker 3>the Internet and other related</v>
<v Speaker 3>communications and information</v>

20
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:36.221
<v Speaker 3>technologies enabled a level of</v>
<v Speaker 3>transparency inside of institutions.</v>

21
00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 3>Not just businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but government and social sector</v>

22
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:44.210
<v Speaker 3>institutions that was not possible for</v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

23
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.570
<v Speaker 3>whether it's yelp for restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's youtube for a social</v>

24
00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:54.970
<v Speaker 3>movements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the ability to create a,</v>

25
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.880
<v Speaker 3>a movement on the Internet that creates</v>
<v Speaker 3>a new president.</v>

26
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.810
<v Speaker 3>Those are environments that would not</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been possible without the</v>

27
00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:07.811
<v Speaker 3>ubiquitous the capability and the low</v>
<v Speaker 3>cost of technology and we've not yet</v>

28
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:13.871
<v Speaker 3>seen what that means for how companies</v>
<v Speaker 3>and large organizations actually operate</v>

29
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:17.510
<v Speaker 3>in that new environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to force a level of</v>

30
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:21.620
<v Speaker 3>transparency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to force a level of ability</v>

31
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:26.621
<v Speaker 3>to respond quickly to things that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to challenge many traditionally</v>

32
00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:29.240
<v Speaker 3>organized institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

33
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 3>I think in the intermediate term that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually going to be good.</v>

34
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 3>It creates a kind of competitive</v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure,</v>

35
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 3>a kind of necessity to deliver in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>light of day.</v>

36
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.640
<v Speaker 3>That in general will be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will particularly be challenging,</v>

37
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:48.350
<v Speaker 3>but in some ways will be very good for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most opaque institutions,</v>

38
00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:52.550
<v Speaker 3>particularly in the government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Creating visibility into how money is</v>

39
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:56.090
<v Speaker 3>spent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Creating visibility into what the real</v>

40
00:02:56.091 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 3>returns on investment are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Creating visibility into the actual</v>

41
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 3>activities that occur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how well they're done or not</v>

42
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.890
<v Speaker 3>creating visibility into how customers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and tax payers and employees think about</v>

43
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.440
<v Speaker 3>institutions is challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it forces institutions to be better</v>

44
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 3>and that's good for the economy.</v>

45
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.760
<v Speaker 3>It requires that that technology be</v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughtfully invested against processes</v>

46
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 3>and activities that actually make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference for the organization and that</v>

47
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 3>you adapt how you do business to reflect</v>
<v Speaker 3>that technology.</v>

48
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 3>I think that's going to be true in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>next generation of web to Datto</v>

49
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 3>technologies as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can be important enablers of</v>

50
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 3>allowing particularly complex</v>
<v Speaker 3>transactions and interactions between</v>

51
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 3>individuals and groups within a company</v>
<v Speaker 3>and between organizations to happen much</v>

52
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 3>more effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they need to be done in a way which</v>

53
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 3>are effectively implemented and</v>
<v Speaker 3>processes that are changed to take</v>

54
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 3>advantage of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I personally find that quite exciting</v>

55
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 3>and the opportunities for knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 3>sharing for real collaboration,</v>

56
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.480
<v Speaker 3>for opening up ways to interact with</v>
<v Speaker 3>people halfway across the globe in a</v>

57
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 3>realtime way interactively is just quite</v>
<v Speaker 3>exciting.</v>

58
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 3>And for someone who spent half their</v>
<v Speaker 3>life on an airplane,</v>

59
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.540
<v Speaker 3>being able to do that in video</v>
<v Speaker 3>conference rather than getting on an</v>

60
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:25.510
<v Speaker 3>airplane for a one hour meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find quite compelling as well.</v>

61
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.520
<v Speaker 3>I think the availability of some</v>
<v Speaker 3>technologies that allow for virtual</v>

62
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:34.860
<v Speaker 3>interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's really high quality video</v>

63
00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:39.861
<v Speaker 3>conference or a web presence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't diminish the need for personal</v>

64
00:04:42.661 --> 00:04:44.640
<v Speaker 3>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just changed the nature of it.</v>

65
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.080
<v Speaker 3>And what it means is that you use the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time when you're together for the kinds</v>

66
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:52.470
<v Speaker 3>of social interactions and getting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>know people and really creating trust</v>

67
00:04:52.471 --> 00:04:56.190
<v Speaker 3>and the relationships that then enable</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to operate,</v>

68
00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.180
<v Speaker 3>to operate effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtually going forward.</v>

69
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

70
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.310
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't diminish the importance of</v>
<v Speaker 3>being together.</v>

71
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.540
<v Speaker 3>It just changes the purpose of that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>allows you to be more effectively using</v>

72
00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:12.810
<v Speaker 3>your time in different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Given the availability of personal</v>

73
00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:16.110
<v Speaker 3>interaction and technology intermediated</v>
<v Speaker 3>interactions and other settings.</v>
