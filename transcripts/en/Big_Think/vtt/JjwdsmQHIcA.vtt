WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.050
<v Speaker 1>The features of the Internet that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>really want to make sure persist.</v>

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.440
<v Speaker 1>And I don't count on a nurse shot to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>the job here,</v>

3
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:12.441
<v Speaker 1>but these features include the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're surfing the web that we're</v>

4
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:16.350
<v Speaker 1>actually visiting lots of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.680
<v Speaker 1>The web of 1998 and sort of through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past 10 years or so has been one where</v>

6
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of baskets with eggs all</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the place.</v>

7
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>And by just clicking on a link,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can visit that new basket and not</v>

8
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>even feel the burdens of the journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be in a basement in Chappaqua,</v>

9
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the server you're going to,</v>

10
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>it could be Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be,</v>

11
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is somewhere in Europe,</v>

12
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:44.550
<v Speaker 1>you name it to anywhere around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

13
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.980
<v Speaker 1>That I think has been less and less so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the research,</v>

14
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on is to actually document</v>

15
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:55.230
<v Speaker 1>and figure out if that hypothesis is</v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

16
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually concerned that because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>worries about things like denial of</v>

17
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>service attacks where websites might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought down,</v>

18
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.790
<v Speaker 1>what we'll see our websites huddling</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the umbrella of just a handful of</v>

19
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Internet service hosting providers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it might feel like you're going from</v>

20
00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>one website to another when in fact all</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing is visiting one quarter of</v>

21
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>the massive data banks at Amazon that</v>
<v Speaker 1>offers up commodity web hosting to the</v>

22
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>world that puts all the eggs in one</v>
<v Speaker 1>basket,</v>

23
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>which seems dangerous to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Amazon goes down,</v>

24
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>everything goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just your ability to one click</v>

25
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>purchase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a mouse trap.</v>

26
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also means that there are regulatory</v>

27
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.480
<v Speaker 1>changes made possible so that if a</v>
<v Speaker 1>government of the world wants something</v>

28
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:48.270
<v Speaker 1>taken down or dealt with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they only have one door to knock on.</v>

29
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>And depending on your view of how easily</v>
<v Speaker 1>government should be able to take stuff</v>

30
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's either a good thing or a bad</v>

31
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

32
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 1>So having a distributed web with eggs</v>
<v Speaker 1>across lots of baskets is one thing that</v>

33
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>I hope will persist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is I hope the web will</v>

34
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>persist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

35
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:08.020
<v Speaker 1>the number of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.040
<v Speaker 1>you might find yourself living your</v>
<v Speaker 1>digital life by running a browser and</v>

37
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>typing in a link.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then from the trap he is going from</v>

38
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>one place to another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 1>visiting each site and clicking on links</v>
<v Speaker 1>and typing stuff that's starting to feel</v>

40
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:30.951
<v Speaker 1>possibly very 2005 more and more the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which we experience the world or</v>

41
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>through apps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were told,</v>

42
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>you could still use your smart phone but</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just can't load up the browser,</v>

43
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 1>you can only use apps and those apps</v>
<v Speaker 1>might have a browser quietly running in</v>

44
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:45.270
<v Speaker 1>the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the experience you'll get inside</v>

45
00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>that APP is so much more defined by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>APP maker.</v>

46
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking at facebook and you</v>

47
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 1>see the sponsored links,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting importuning you to do</v>

48
00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost always it's bottom line,</v>

49
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>please install this app.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants you to install their app</v>

50
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>and that's because that's putting you</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the bottle of a miniature</v>

51
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:11.161
<v Speaker 1>universe that isn't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>connected web like to the rest of</v>

52
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you see something interesting inside</v>

53
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>an app and you want to share it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be under the terms of that APP.</v>

54
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Whether you can email the link or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you can only tweet it or whether</v>

55
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 1>you can do anything with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a common url,</v>

56
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>that bar at the top that you can just</v>
<v Speaker 1>copy and paste and share with a friend</v>

57
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 1>and then that friend can see what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

58
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>So as I look to the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really thinking about the future of the</v>

59
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>web itself is something we we ought to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be doing.</v>

60
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't take for granted that there will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a worldwide web the way that there</v>

61
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be much more stove piped and</v>

62
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>feel a little bit more like 1985 with in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

63
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 1>compuserve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prodigy,</v>

64
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 1>and the source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

65
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>You've got your apps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those apps in turn are there at the</v>

66
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:55.670
<v Speaker 1>sufferance of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.400
<v Speaker 1>mobile phone or your other platform</v>
<v Speaker 1>vendor and so much more staid</v>

68
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.940
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so much of the benefits of the</v>

69
00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:08.941
<v Speaker 1>Internet have come from unusual corners</v>
<v Speaker 1>from not being so staid.</v>

70
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>I'd hate to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

71
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 1>those were the early days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things have matured.</v>

72
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Now there is a genuine worry about</v>
<v Speaker 1>security that has it no longer seems so</v>

73
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:25.120
<v Speaker 1>crazy as it probably did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it did.</v>

74
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>And say the year 2000 g maybe before you</v>
<v Speaker 1>run an APP,</v>

75
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 1>someone out there should vet it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should know who wrote it,</v>

76
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>should have their contact information on</v>
<v Speaker 1>file.</v>

77
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 1>The way that if you get into a taxi cab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember taxi cabs,</v>

78
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 1>there'd be a an identity marker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you use an uber or Lyft,</v>

79
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 1>they have some way of knowing who the</v>
<v Speaker 1>drivers are.</v>

80
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 1>They're registered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's the level of security you want</v>

81
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 1>when you drive three blocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you want that for code to</v>

82
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:56.230
<v Speaker 1>which you are and trusting your most</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate details and more and more.</v>

83
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what we see happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that that's terrible,</v>

84
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:04.801
<v Speaker 1>but it does show a general trend in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>name of security in having</v>

85
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:11.101
<v Speaker 1>intermediaries be able to more tightly</v>
<v Speaker 1>control the code that we can run,</v>

86
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.490
<v Speaker 1>whether it's on our device or afar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the content that we can see.</v>
