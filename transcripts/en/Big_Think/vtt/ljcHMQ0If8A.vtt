1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.720
<v Speaker 1>We might've asked rhetorically on whose</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes the president,</v>

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>President Obama wants to increase the</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard journalistic responses.</v>

3
00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:12.880
<v Speaker 1>The rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my preferred response is Republicans.</v>

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Republican voters are disproportionately</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy,</v>

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wants to tax Republicans to</v>

6
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>reward Democrats they want to cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending in order to reduce the deficit.</v>

7
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.560
<v Speaker 1>And where would they like to reduce</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending entitlements?</v>

8
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Who disproportionately benefits from</v>
<v Speaker 1>entitlements the relatively poor who</v>

9
00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:39.541
<v Speaker 1>disproportionately vote Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Republicans want to punish the</v>

10
00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Democrats to reward their constituents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Democrats want to punish the</v>

11
00:00:44.651 --> 00:00:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Republicans to reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

12
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.760
<v Speaker 1>how might we fix this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.740
<v Speaker 1>it would be nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

14
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.581
<v Speaker 1>if a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

15
00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:55.810
<v Speaker 1>the people elected the congress instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the members of Congress choosing who</v>

16
00:00:55.811 --> 00:01:00.010
<v Speaker 1>their voters will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gerrymandering ensures that the congress</v>

17
00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:02.230
<v Speaker 1>gets to pick its voters around the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>way around.</v>

18
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.180
<v Speaker 1>So the probability of being reelected as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an incumbent in the congress is 95</v>

19
00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:10.090
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost as high as it was in the old</v>

20
00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union of being reelected to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>parliament.</v>

21
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a rig system.</v>

22
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.270
<v Speaker 1>We could fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or there are lots of excellent political</v>

23
00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:23.680
<v Speaker 1>science studies on how to design a</v>
<v Speaker 1>redistricting.</v>

24
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.340
<v Speaker 1>So that it's completely nonpartisan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely one person,</v>

25
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 1>one vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a subject to geographic constraints and</v>

26
00:01:31.331 --> 00:01:34.990
<v Speaker 1>topology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could write computer programs that do</v>

27
00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:35.890
<v Speaker 1>redistricting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

28
00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:39.730
<v Speaker 1>no member of Congress is going to agree</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that in the short term because that</v>

29
00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:42.070
<v Speaker 1>would put her or his hold on power at</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk.</v>

30
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.260
<v Speaker 1>But if we were to pass a law that says</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting in 20 years or 25 years,</v>

31
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.140
<v Speaker 1>this program will be used to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>redistricting.</v>

32
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.940
<v Speaker 1>We would have solved the problem of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>voters not choosing their members of</v>

33
00:01:54.941 --> 00:01:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that will go a long way to altering</v>

34
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.540
<v Speaker 1>the risk of being thrown out of office</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do what the,</v>

35
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 1>what the people want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'd get much better policy.</v>

36
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.450
<v Speaker 1>But that's very far down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shorter term.</v>

37
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Also hard to do a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could get rid of the electoral</v>

38
00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

39
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>it's useful to remember that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people speak about standing by the</v>

41
00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:22.510
<v Speaker 1>original constitution and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being strict constitutionalist,</v>

42
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.130
<v Speaker 1>the electoral college was designed as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery institution.</v>

43
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.520
<v Speaker 1>We got rid of slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't gotten rid of this slavery</v>

44
00:02:30.521 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>institution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ought to,</v>

45
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.240
<v Speaker 1>that too would ensure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:34.811
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:39.760
<v Speaker 1>presidents would be more responsive to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>still larger coalition and that would</v>

48
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.860
<v Speaker 1>mean doing more of what we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people want.</v>
