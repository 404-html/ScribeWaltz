1
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Farmers inducer this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this loop,</v>

2
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old world breathing,</v>

3
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.170
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a bore and the south,</v>

4
00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:17.050
<v Speaker 1>so they do natural breeding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Mo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 99% of the breeding pigs.</v>

6
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for one,</v>

7
00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:23.360
<v Speaker 1>it happens with a lot of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pigs,</v>

8
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>

9
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is done with,</v>

10
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.500
<v Speaker 1>with um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.790
<v Speaker 1>frozen semen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>it was basically artificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>insemination,</v>

13
00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.850
<v Speaker 1>so they had these super bores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which there's like,</v>

15
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like 2000 super bores that</v>

16
00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:40.610
<v Speaker 1>they take the semen from and that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets impregnated into the south,</v>

17
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.360
<v Speaker 1>and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the industrial level because,</v>

19
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:45.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

20
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.200
<v Speaker 1>they want the good genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are certain boards that have</v>

21
00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:51.950
<v Speaker 1>been bred to be great producers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>producers meaning,</v>

22
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their offspring grow quickly.</v>

23
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have good fat to meat ratio,</v>

24
00:00:57.471 --> 00:00:58.131
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

25
00:00:58.131 --> 00:00:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the industry is looking for it.</v>

26
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the other white meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:02.540
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where your other white meat is</v>

28
00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

29
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.700
<v Speaker 1>from frozen semen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've a very select few bores.</v>

30
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the natural way of course to do</v>

31
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>it is to get a born a salad together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Sal,</v>

32
00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>when she's in heat and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

33
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:15.130
<v Speaker 1>and have them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

34
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 1>have them work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

35
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>but that's a hard thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a frustrating job because you've</v>

36
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:24.620
<v Speaker 1>got to get the sow when she's in heat in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bore revved up and it's got to work</v>

37
00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:26.510
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some complications there.</v>

38
00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.500
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of old world farming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it produce better flavor?</v>

40
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.230
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would be a tough argument because</v>

42
00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:37.310
<v Speaker 1>there are other people who would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

43
00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you get the super boards?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're bred for.</v>

44
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.980
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a no brainer when you're</v>

45
00:01:42.981 --> 00:01:44.990
<v Speaker 1>educational facility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the reason we do it.</v>

46
00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:48.350
<v Speaker 1>We're an education facility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're there to show how it's done.</v>

47
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would argue that the flavor is</v>

48
00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:54.680
<v Speaker 1>better because you can control your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

49
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.710
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your future stock when you know your</v>

50
00:01:57.711 --> 00:01:58.401
<v Speaker 1>bore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

51
00:01:58.401 --> 00:02:01.190
<v Speaker 1>so you can choose your board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can choose your sow and you can</v>

52
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:02.600
<v Speaker 1>marry that together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can,</v>

53
00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:05.120
<v Speaker 1>through patients through time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through generations,</v>

54
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>increase the quality of your meat just</v>
<v Speaker 1>by getting to know your meat.</v>

55
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what we're there for.</v>

56
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:12.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's the exciting part about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you buy off the Internet,</v>

57
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 1>go to swine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics.com you can get frozen semen</v>

58
00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:15.920
<v Speaker 1>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:02:15.921 --> 00:02:17.390
<v Speaker 1>you can use that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

60
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.090
<v Speaker 1>but you really don't know what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting and you don't know what your</v>

61
00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:22.400
<v Speaker 1>introducing to your farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in this way,</v>

62
00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:26.180
<v Speaker 1>you're in a closed system and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me to be a much more</v>

63
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>interesting way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

64
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.173
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

65
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.540
<v Speaker 1>and for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flavorful way</v>

66
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.993
<v Speaker 2>arm for the future.</v>

67
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:40.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other white meat basically there,</v>

69
00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:41.710
<v Speaker 1>they've gone in the other direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

70
00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:44.320
<v Speaker 1>they've tried to work out any fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.900
<v Speaker 1>because basically in the seventies</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken,</v>

72
00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:49.870
<v Speaker 1>the chicken industry exploded a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it will,</v>

73
00:02:49.871 --> 00:02:51.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was lean white meat,</v>

74
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it took away,</v>

75
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.840
<v Speaker 1>directly impacted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

76
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.950
<v Speaker 1>the pork industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the pork industry launched this</v>

77
00:02:56.951 --> 00:03:00.120
<v Speaker 1>enormous effort in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bring back sales.</v>

78
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>I did it by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by with a slogan,</v>

79
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>the other white meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was basically to breed out the</v>

80
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>get the other lean white meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was cheaper and,</v>

83
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and supposedly delicious and so,</v>

84
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:13.341
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

85
00:03:13.341 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more helpful for you and whatnot.</v>

86
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>So we've lost a tremendous amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of breeding knowledge of,</v>

87
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a stock of pigs that provide fat.</v>

88
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>And when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have intermuscular fat and fat,</v>

89
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>you have tons of flavor because the fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>carries the flavor.</v>

90
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what we're doing is breeding older</v>

91
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>varieties of bigs that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

92
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 1>that have a lot of flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they grow slower,</v>

93
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're a little bit more difficult</v>

94
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 1>to raise and you can't raise them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this confinement factory facility.</v>

95
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>So it's more expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's much more delicious and it's</v>

96
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 1>much better for the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are studies that show that</v>

97
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 1>it's much better for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

98
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on all three.</v>

99
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

100
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trick,</v>

101
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:55.560
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me here with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the stoma,</v>

102
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.090
<v Speaker 1>just looking at the overall gestalt of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing is like,</v>

103
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>is that flavor is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the leader.</v>

104
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now if you had one of the farmers</v>

105
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 1>sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might argue and I think pretty</v>

106
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 1>passionately that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

107
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 1>well if you had the animal farm or he</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably argued passionately that it's</v>

108
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 1>the humanity of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the pig that thereafter.</v>

109
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

110
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.630
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best life for the pig is what his</v>

111
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 1>goal is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the vegetable farmer probably say,</v>

112
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>do I know in the vegetable farmer Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably say something like,</v>

113
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the ecology,</v>

114
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.150
<v Speaker 1>it's about the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

115
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 1>it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to,</v>

116
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.130
<v Speaker 1>to encourage all the floor on the fauna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it all relates,</v>

117
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:34.510
<v Speaker 1>it's one ecosystem and one mini</v>
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem and that's what you're after.</v>

118
00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 1>And food is important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

119
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality of the food is important in</v>

120
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:38.240
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are really great.</v>

121
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.560
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Craig with the humanities.</v>

122
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so me,</v>

123
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

124
00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:44.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father always said like to a shoe</v>

125
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

126
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing like leather,</v>

127
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to me,</v>

128
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:48.780
<v Speaker 1>like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

129
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.800
<v Speaker 1>to on this place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's nothing like the best way</v>

130
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:51.634
<v Speaker 1>or food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>

131
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say I win in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we all win because if you</v>

132
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.350
<v Speaker 1>lead with flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you lead with the flavor of the pork</v>

133
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 1>or the carrot and you backtrack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to end up having to</v>

134
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 1>practice the best ecological</v>
<v Speaker 1>stewardship.</v>

135
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to have the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>biology in the soil,</v>

136
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best nutrient density in the soil</v>

137
00:05:12.231 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you don't get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flavor for that pig.</v>

138
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to do the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>breeding practices,</v>

139
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>which are gonna lead to the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>ecological conditions for the pig and</v>

140
00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>the best humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

141
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.730
<v Speaker 1>so this idea that flavor and hedonism</v>
<v Speaker 1>and delicious food runs amok to</v>

142
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>environmental stewardship and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

143
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 1>and humane treatment of animals and even</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>

144
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:37.781
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

145
00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:39.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making money is,</v>

146
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a false choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

147
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I believe strongly that chefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.800
<v Speaker 1>chefs can lead this in the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>because our,</v>

150
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 1>what our leather is good flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hedonism.</v>

151
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we're talking about here</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all of this is,</v>

152
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.290
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is hedonism.</v>

153
00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 1>And why the message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me to be so strong for the</v>

154
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why people are catching on because it's</v>

155
00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:04.640
<v Speaker 1>not about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not about sacrifice.</v>

156
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not about a religious kind of thing</v>

157
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 1>where you have to give up something to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find a sense of fulfillment.</v>

158
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the opposite.</v>

159
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:15.851
<v Speaker 1>It's you do more of the hedonistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasurable eating experience and you're</v>

160
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 1>doing better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

161
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 1>so if you're after the best flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just is axiomatic that,</v>

162
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 1>that the best ecological practices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental practices are going to be</v>

163
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>in hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not far behind.</v>

164
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 1>And the most humane treatment of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape and of the animals is not far</v>

165
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 1>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also the best economy.</v>

166
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is a false assumption that that,</v>

167
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really flavorful food is expensive food.</v>

168
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really not.</v>

169
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

170
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 1>we prove that it's stone barns every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

171
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:50.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cost of doing business and</v>

173
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:53.360
<v Speaker 1>agriculture is about distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not about the actual adequate to</v>

174
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:54.194
<v Speaker 1>be actual growing.</v>

175
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.230
<v Speaker 1>If the farmers were the one getting rich</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our big food chain,</v>

176
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.630
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a whole different story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're not,</v>

177
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.630
<v Speaker 1>they're struggling to get by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the middlemen,</v>

178
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 1>the men who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are distributing to have the power</v>

179
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:08.390
<v Speaker 1>of distribution and the sellers in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketplace that make the money,</v>

180
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 1>that value adds of the product or make</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money just in pure distribution and</v>

181
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 1>economies of scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never about the,</v>

182
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of,</v>

183
00:07:15.341 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 1>of carrots that you can take out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground per acre.</v>

184
00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:19.760
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so economy,</v>

185
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:20.930
<v Speaker 1>ecology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flavor,</v>

186
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.170
<v Speaker 1>they're all one in the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

187
00:07:22.171 --> 00:07:23.001
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a,</v>

188
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:26.600
<v Speaker 1>that's a powerful message for the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not about giving up</v>

189
00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:28.710
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about doing more of the same house.</v>
