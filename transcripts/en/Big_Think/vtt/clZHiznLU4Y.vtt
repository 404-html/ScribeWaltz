00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Viral Mark Zuckerberg for a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

2
00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:05.250
<v Speaker 1>I would buy more hoodies in different</v>
<v Speaker 1>colors.</v>

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 1>The second I would discuss with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>senior team,</v>

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.640
<v Speaker 1>the practice of edgerank as it impacts</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's personal profiles,</v>

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.060
<v Speaker 1>so visa vi brands were brands are</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting less organic views so they have</v>

6
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>to pay up to promote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hallelujah.</v>

7
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Take them for all you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You deserve that,</v>

8
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.270
<v Speaker 1>but I think that it's kind of dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>where trixie and biff,</v>

9
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>if they have a baby or if they graduate</v>
<v Speaker 1>from college and they put up their</v>

10
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>graduation picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they think that if they have a</v>

11
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>thousand followers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all thousand people can see it and from</v>

12
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>what I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if it's true,</v>

13
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 1>but if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not 1000 people will see it.</v>

14
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Maybe 100 people will see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that if trixie and bf start</v>

15
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:03.531
<v Speaker 1>losing confidence that facebook is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to post their life story to</v>

16
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.040
<v Speaker 1>everybody who has voluntarily follow</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

17
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>that you could be throwing out the baby</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the bathwater.</v>

18
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.260
<v Speaker 1>And if enough people think this way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stop using facebook,</v>

19
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.530
<v Speaker 1>then you won't be able to charge the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brands for promoting their posts.</v>

20
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the outside looking in.</v>

21
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I know how these algorithms work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there are any algorithms like that.</v>

22
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:30.600
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's really playing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>
