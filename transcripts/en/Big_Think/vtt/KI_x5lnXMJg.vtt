00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I think most of us dread Mondays because</v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally we've learned to dread</v>

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Mondays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live for the weekend.</v>

3
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Our music is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:12.270
<v Speaker 1>celebrates Fridays better than Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our movies celebrate Fridays better than</v>

5
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.270
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe our parents did too.</v>

7
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I think there was a generation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have the same freedoms you and I</v>

8
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years ago,</v>

10
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have this conversation where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say to the camera to everybody</v>

11
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

12
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>you have a chance to plug into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>community that will help you.</v>

13
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.100
<v Speaker 1>You didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you even find those people in</v>

14
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:34.890
<v Speaker 1>1960?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How has your mom or your dad going to</v>

15
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>find a community of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other photographers,</v>

16
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 1>other artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other bankers,</v>

17
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 1>other anything's easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't.</v>

18
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.180
<v Speaker 1>So I think we have access to people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tools and experiences that no other</v>

19
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>generation had access to.</v>

20
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>And so in addition to that being a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity,</v>

21
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a huge responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a chance to break that mold of a</v>

22
00:00:56.311 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 1>job is just the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monday is horrible and Friday is great.</v>

23
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>What if we got to reinvent that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if we got to rescue Mondays and</v>

24
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean be fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying tomorrow turn a frown</v>

25
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

26
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm much more practical than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have some difficult</v>

27
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Tuesdays that aren't fun.</v>

28
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as a perfect job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that cripples</v>

29
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:19.290
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think I have to find the perfect</v>

30
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>job where I only do things I want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that doesn't exist.</v>

31
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>But what if you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

32
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>can I use more of me at my next job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I use more of me on a Monday?</v>

33
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Then I got to a week ago?</v>

34
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Can I use more of the things I'm good</v>
<v Speaker 1>at?</v>

35
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Can I start to look forward to going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work?</v>

36
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Can I start to look forward to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday and not just live in this</v>

37
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>culture that only celebrates Friday?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want us to have a life where we</v>

38
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>feel like Tim Robbins at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shawshank redemption as we drive away</v>

39
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:49.560
<v Speaker 1>from work on Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sense of relief.</v>

40
00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Finally I got out of that because here's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's really bad math and</v>

41
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:55.410
<v Speaker 1>here's what I mean by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody,</v>

42
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>many saying to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll give you two weeks of vacation and</v>

43
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 1>exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want you to give us 50 weeks.</v>

44
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>This year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 for two is terrible math trading.</v>

45
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 1>50 weeks of misery for two weeks of</v>
<v Speaker 1>vacation is bad math trading.</v>

46
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Five days you don't like for two days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do like again is bad math training,</v>

47
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>40 years of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

48
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I write about career.</v>

49
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>You're going to do this thing for 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

50
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>40 to 60 hours a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's invest in it.</v>

51
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Let's make it as good as it can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make it as awesome as it can be</v>

52
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.510
<v Speaker 1>because it matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about four decades of your</v>

53
00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly we should lean into that.</v>

54
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
