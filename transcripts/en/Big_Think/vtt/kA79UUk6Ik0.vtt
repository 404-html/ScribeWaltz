1
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the most more surprising</v>

2
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that I'm be</v>

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>following and blogging about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the reports that have come out</v>

4
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:14.450
<v Speaker 1>of the Pew Research Center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.900
<v Speaker 1>it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these analysis,</v>

6
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:19.470
<v Speaker 1>they're looking at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly are people talking about at</v>

7
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>blogs and this new media ecosystem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's blogs,</v>

8
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>whether it's independent media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's twitter or whether it's a</v>

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where is that content coming from?</v>

10
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

11
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>in one particular study that they looked</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

12
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>they looked at the media ecosystem</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding a Baltimore,</v>

13
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Maryland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.330
<v Speaker 1>and in that study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they found is roughly on average,</v>

15
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.510
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of the topics that were being</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about at blogs or other</v>

16
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>independent media originated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional news organizations in</v>

17
00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either the local newspaper,</v>

18
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>the Baltimore Sun for the national</v>
<v Speaker 1>newspapers in their,</v>

19
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>in their online version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That tells me that,</v>

20
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where a lot of,</v>

21
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people claim that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional media is no longer relevant.</v>

22
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fundamentally rely upon the</v>

23
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>traditional media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the role of the traditional journalists</v>

24
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>as an independent professional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a news gatherer to inform ourselves.</v>

25
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's the fabric of what we discuss</v>
<v Speaker 1>online and without the traditional,</v>

26
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>a traditional news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that traditional news gathering process,</v>

27
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>we really wouldn't have a lot of good</v>
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>

28
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>and we wouldn't have a lot of original</v>
<v Speaker 1>reporting,</v>

30
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere.</v>

31
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:31.790
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

33
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.860
<v Speaker 1>the other really interesting thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

34
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more recently they looked at the major</v>

35
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>blogs and they looked at an analysis of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the major blogs,</v>

36
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>public affairs related blogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they looked at what those blogs are</v>

37
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:47.841
<v Speaker 1>discussing and where the links are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to m and a and more than 90 percent of</v>

38
00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:54.150
<v Speaker 1>the topics discussed in the links.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're back to the traditional media.</v>

39
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's also interesting because</v>

40
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:57.920
<v Speaker 1>people claim now that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.870
<v Speaker 1>the blogosphere now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>has this ability to control the news</v>
<v Speaker 1>agenda.</v>

43
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not necessarily the case.</v>

44
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.450
<v Speaker 1>The blogs are still influenced and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still driven by what's being</v>

45
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>reported.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The New York Times or on the broadcast</v>

46
00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>news or on the cable news networks or</v>
<v Speaker 1>political talk radio.</v>

47
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 1>It's that they take that content and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sometimes refocus it.</v>

48
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>They redirected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shape that agenda to either be in a</v>

49
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>certain ideological direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might reframe the significance and</v>

50
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>the information that's being reported</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

51
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>or they might take the agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the traditional media and focus in on</v>

52
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>just a few topics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:37.371
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a foreign policy climate</v>
<v Speaker 1>change or particular political scandal,</v>

54
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple couple a things to</v>

55
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:51.880
<v Speaker 1>think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:52.390
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

57
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>when you're considering a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tendency towards self self selection</v>

58
00:02:58.301 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure to different topics and public</v>

59
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that,</v>

60
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back three or four or five</v>

61
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 sixties when we've asked in</v>

62
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>surveys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quiz questions about the public's</v>

63
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.840
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of the most basic political</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts or the basic facts about issues</v>

64
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>related to science or the environment.</v>

65
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Inevitably the public scores very low in</v>
<v Speaker 1>these fundamental a quiz,</v>

66
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 1>a quiz like surveys about either public</v>
<v Speaker 1>affairs,</v>

67
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:27.450
<v Speaker 1>literacy or science literacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

68
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that hasn't changed.</v>

69
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we,</v>

70
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 1>what we've seen over the last 15 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that public knowledge and public</v>

71
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 1>scores and those types of questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>remain relatively relatively stable.</v>

72
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a question though,</v>

73
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:46.310
<v Speaker 1>whether that's the best measure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>public knowledge or of,</v>

74
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of civic culture.</v>

75
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

76
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.480
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that we're seeing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually not necessarily a decline</v>

77
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in basic public knowledge,</v>

78
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.620
<v Speaker 1>but a real problem at getting public</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and in elevating public</v>

79
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:07.561
<v Speaker 1>concern about many different issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The environment is a great example where</v>

80
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 1>climate change is a great example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

81
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a problem really</v>

82
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:17.161
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally have of choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the great paradox of the age of</v>

83
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 1>engagement that today we have more</v>
<v Speaker 1>information choices about public</v>

84
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

85
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>

86
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 1>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment than anytime in history.</v>

87
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Yet if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consumer of information or as a</v>

88
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 1>member of the audience or an individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of preference or a motivation to</v>

89
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>engage with that a news and information</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a regular basis,</v>

90
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.910
<v Speaker 1>you can completely avoid that</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

91
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not top of mind.</v>

92
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.963
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

93
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.780
<v Speaker 1>it becomes that much more difficult than</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

94
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.750
<v Speaker 1>to really raise the type of political</v>
<v Speaker 1>will necessary to get things done in</v>

95
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 1>this country on issues like climate</v>
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>

96
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social security,</v>

97
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare.</v>

98
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you name the public problem.</v>
