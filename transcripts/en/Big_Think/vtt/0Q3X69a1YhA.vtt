1
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.880
<v Speaker 1>I think I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I want to,</v>

2
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I like to say three hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

3
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:11.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably in a day when I'm on my desk </v>

4
00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:14.360
<v Speaker 1>and not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:19.361
<v Speaker 1>in New York City or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I read more than most people</v>

6
00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:24.680
<v Speaker 1>in those younger than me who are so busy</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing things.</v>

7
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.090
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:26.924
<v Speaker 1>I have the leisure time actually to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to read and I think that's what we've </v>

9
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.950
<v Speaker 1>lost now in sort of science today is </v>
<v Speaker 1>leisure a quick.</v>

10
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.950
<v Speaker 1>And I had plenty of leisure because </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing was happening.</v>

11
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.830
<v Speaker 1>We were trying to find the DNA </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

12
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.100
<v Speaker 1>one hundreds of new facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.410
<v Speaker 1>almost every week that we might learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

14
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.443
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now people really defensively wanted </v>

15
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>to be sure that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will think they're experts.</v>

17
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.830
<v Speaker 1>So they become more and more narrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>experts and not very broad.</v>

18
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.190
<v Speaker 1>And I still can't get over when I was at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a large pharmaceutical company.</v>

19
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.190
<v Speaker 1>They half jokingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure the reality was true.</v>

20
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.840
<v Speaker 1>He had a thousand PHD technicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you got your phd,</v>

21
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.333
<v Speaker 1>you were just a technician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one was hiring into a very narrow </v>

22
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not show any,</v>

23
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big thoughts at all.</v>

24
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with so many facts,</v>

26
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I missed our thinkers,</v>

27
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

28
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.370
<v Speaker 1>or smart now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even when I was boy,</v>

29
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>smart people respect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's,</v>

30
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will do things who doors.</v>

31
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.220
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also you find that,</v>

32
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there hadn't been one person doing it.</v>

33
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.090
<v Speaker 1>There are 15 names on the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

34
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our famous paper for instance,</v>

35
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.810
<v Speaker 1>could have included Maurice Wilkins name</v>
<v Speaker 1>out because he was really part of a,</v>

36
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>you didn't make the final discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>

37
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of this stuff just for Ford.</v>

38
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.520
<v Speaker 1>So we asked him to put his name on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper and I said,</v>

39
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:43.450
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a three person pepper.</v>

40
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

41
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:47.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

42
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:52.241
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried about people really</v>

43
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 2>thinking</v>

44
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't find many people who do.</v>

45
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.173
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 1>when I was a student at University of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>

48
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.513
<v Speaker 1>Robert Hutchinson is free shed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The function of the College of the </v>

49
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>University of Chicago is to prepare you </v>
<v Speaker 1>for greatness.</v>

50
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>He used those words because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.713
<v Speaker 1>our educational is largely reading the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great books and you were reading the </v>

52
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>great books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to,</v>

53
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:37.051
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a teacher,</v>

54
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.710
<v Speaker 1>but to let you go beyond the great books</v>
<v Speaker 1>on producing another great book.</v>

55
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.750
<v Speaker 1>So that was how he saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

56
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.480
<v Speaker 1>he would know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't happen very often,</v>

57
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.240
<v Speaker 1>but it was still there that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.010
<v Speaker 1>and it certainly in dreams of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:04:06.261 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 1>that they do something big was the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>they keep it secret because,</v>

60
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so unrealistic and often then you </v>

61
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 1>get braggers who tell you you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something great and,</v>

62
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't believe them.</v>

63
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.960
<v Speaker 1>But nonetheless,</v>

64
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some sort of quiet way you should,</v>

65
00:04:30.411 --> 00:04:32.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.500
<v Speaker 1>have big dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop having 15 names on a paper.</v>

67
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.510
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.383
<v Speaker 1>I accept the fact the rest really didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>think at all about this and you should </v>

69
00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.670
<v Speaker 1>were just technicians in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

71
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a real sense.</v>

72
00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:02.400
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.430
<v Speaker 1>reserve authors share for people who put</v>
<v Speaker 1>together sentences.</v>

74
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

76
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer,</v>

77
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.310
<v Speaker 1>whereas a very outset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>factories with the mother of a scientist</v>

78
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:28.041
<v Speaker 1>now have their second secondhand over </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper where there are 20 other people on</v>

79
00:05:30.661 --> 00:05:35.640
<v Speaker 1>the paper and she'd wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he going anywhere?</v>

80
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.930
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.620
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and another problem may be though it was</v>

82
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.770
<v Speaker 1>against everything we now say we may be </v>
<v Speaker 1>trained to,</v>

83
00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 1>when they scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his.</v>

84
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>We're training people who really don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to think.</v>

85
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.420
<v Speaker 1>They just want to have jobs and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they consume money and uh,</v>

86
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>so you'd lose some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:23.441
<v Speaker 1>if you cut off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people didn't have real dream.</v>

88
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.730
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

89
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.010
<v Speaker 1>if you going into science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

90
00:06:32.011 --> 00:06:35.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better go in with the dream,</v>

91
00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:36.124
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you two would get a Nobel </v>

92
00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:38.764
<v Speaker 1>prize.</v>

93
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:42.813
<v Speaker 1>I went in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was very bright and I was </v>

95
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:46.670
<v Speaker 1>going to get one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll confessional,</v>

96
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.053
<v Speaker 1>I knew what it was and quick games he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was otherwise because I saw that </v>

98
00:06:55.361 --> 00:06:56.194
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought we're going to get a Nobel </v>

99
00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 1>prize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

100
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:05.831
<v Speaker 1>that was within five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so obvious.</v>
