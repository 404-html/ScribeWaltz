1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm often asked and occasionally in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>accusatory way,</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>are you atheist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the only [inaudible] I am is a</v>

3
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:10.890
<v Speaker 1>scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't associate with movements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in ism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>I think for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment,</v>

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.040
<v Speaker 1>once someone attaches you to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy or a movement,</v>

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.620
<v Speaker 1>then they assign all the baggage and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the philosophy that goes</v>

9
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:33.420
<v Speaker 1>with it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you want to have a</v>

10
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will assert that they already know</v>

11
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>everything important there is to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about you because of that association.</v>

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the way to have our</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

13
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather we explore each other's ideas</v>

14
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:53.571
<v Speaker 1>and real time rather than assign a label</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it and assert you know what's going</v>

15
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:58.581
<v Speaker 1>to happen in advance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what people are really after is what</v>

16
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>is my stance on religion or spirituality</v>
<v Speaker 1>or God.</v>

17
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>And I would s I would say if I had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find a word that came closest,</v>

18
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:10.641
<v Speaker 1>it would be a agnostic agnostic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're dates from the 19th century Huxley</v>

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.400
<v Speaker 1>to refer to someone who doesn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it hasn't yet really seen evidence</v>

20
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it prepared to embrace the evidence</v>

21
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>if it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it's not,</v>

22
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>it won't be forced to have to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that is not otherwise</v>

23
00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>supported.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>There are many atheists who say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

25
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>all agnostics or atheists like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

26
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm constantly claimed by atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find this intriguing.</v>

27
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my Wiki pay,</v>

28
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 1>I didn't create the Wiki page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others did.</v>

29
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 1>And I'm flattered that people cared</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough about my life to assemble it.</v>

30
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.050
<v Speaker 1>And it said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Neil,</v>

31
00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:55.250
<v Speaker 1>the recitation is an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

32
00:01:55.251 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not really true.</v>

33
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.590
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

34
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neil degrasse Tyson is a agnostic.</v>

35
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Went back a week later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had been it,</v>

36
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>it said Neil Tyson as an atheist again</v>
<v Speaker 1>within a week.</v>

37
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.871
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

38
00:02:07.871 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 1>what's up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

39
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>I am not the word it a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

40
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:12.061
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

41
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Neil degrasse Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>widely claimed by atheist is actually an</v>

42
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>agnostic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some will say,</v>

43
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not being fair to the fact that</v>

44
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>they're actually the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

45
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:23.461
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing.</v>

46
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atheist,</v>

47
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:29.500
<v Speaker 1>I know who proudly wear the badge are</v>
<v Speaker 1>active atheist.</v>

48
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>They're like in your face atheist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to change policies and they're</v>

49
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.180
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're having debates.</v>

50
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interest,</v>

51
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 1>the energy to do any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a scientist.</v>

52
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm an educator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My goal is to get people thinking</v>

53
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 1>straight in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get you to be curious about the</v>

54
00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:52.224
<v Speaker 1>natural world.</v>

55
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not about any of the rest of this.</v>

56
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.510
<v Speaker 1>And it's odd that the word atheist even</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>

57
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't play golf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a word for non golf players?</v>

58
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Do non golf players gather and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

59
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and strategize.</v>

60
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do non-skiers have a word and come</v>

61
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>together and talk about the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't ski?</v>

62
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

63
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't gather around and talk about how</v>

64
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>much everybody in the room doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in God.</v>

65
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the energy for that.</v>

66
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.920
<v Speaker 1>And so I agnostic separates me from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conduct of atheist,</v>

67
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>whether or not this strong overlap</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the two categories,</v>

68
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 1>and at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather not be any category.</v>

69
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
