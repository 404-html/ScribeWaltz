1
00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.930
<v Speaker 1>My contributions</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to,</v>

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at new technology products that</v>

3
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>come along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick out what I do,</v>

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.010
<v Speaker 2>I think are the most interesting ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And try to tell a fairly large group of</v>

5
00:00:18.461 --> 00:00:20.410
<v Speaker 2>readers whether I think they're worth</v>
<v Speaker 2>buying.</v>

6
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to overinflate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I do.</v>

7
00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:25.510
<v Speaker 2>The other thing I do is I explain some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these technologies.</v>

8
00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Some of my comms are not product</v>
<v Speaker 2>reviews,</v>

9
00:00:27.551 --> 00:00:29.140
<v Speaker 2>but they are,</v>

10
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.480
<v Speaker 2>planers about technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I,</v>

12
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.900
<v Speaker 2>a few times a year I do comms where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>take on broader issues like I,</v>

13
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack the,</v>

14
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.090
<v Speaker 2>what I consider to be the excessive</v>
<v Speaker 2>control of the phone,</v>

15
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.030
<v Speaker 2>wireless phone companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll take them on.</v>

16
00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:49.660
<v Speaker 2>And that gets me to be kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial for a few weeks,</v>

17
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

18
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.903
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 2>but that's my role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

21
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflated.</v>

24
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a journalist.</v>

25
00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:01.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm a reviewer.</v>

26
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

27
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.713
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.310
<v Speaker 2>thankfully I'm grateful for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a good,</v>

29
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 2>large following.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

30
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:10.431
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

31
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:12.830
<v Speaker 2>I just help people sort through the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

32
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.860
<v Speaker 2>the thicket of these technology options</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have.</v>

33
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.630
<v Speaker 2>But I don't invent technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't create technology</v>

34
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 1>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 1>monetize technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write about it.</v>

37
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.131
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to,</v>

38
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm not going to buy into the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I could make and break</v>

39
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.030
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously the Wall Street Journal is</v>

40
00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 2>widely read our websites and I'm now</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

41
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:44.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm now on many different websites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>syndicated,</v>

42
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

43
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm running my own with a partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kara swisher website called the all</v>

44
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:51.270
<v Speaker 2>things d.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dot com.</v>

45
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 2>So I obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I have a lot of readers,</v>

46
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.730
<v Speaker 2>if I say this product is really good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helps them.</v>

47
00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:01.380
<v Speaker 2>If I say it's really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hurts them.</v>

48
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 2>But that's different than saying you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>make and break products.</v>

49
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm also not going to say I'm central to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the development.</v>

50
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 2>I've never invented anything except a</v>
<v Speaker 2>co,</v>

51
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.560
<v Speaker 2>a column and a conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been in any tech products.</v>

52
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.980
<v Speaker 2>But I think if you're asking me why have</v>
<v Speaker 2>I developed a following and been able to</v>

53
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 2>retain a following,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I do admit I have done,</v>

54
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it's because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

55
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 2>I've stayed true to the mission that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>proposed 16 years ago.</v>

56
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to be goofy about it,</v>

57
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:38.520
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes the simple principles are</v>

58
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:42.870
<v Speaker 2>what works and I've just been laser</v>
<v Speaker 2>focused on,</v>

59
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.930
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

60
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.910
<v Speaker 2>a very specific but large audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is non techies.</v>

61
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.410
<v Speaker 2>People who don't want to be techies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have better things to do with</v>

62
00:02:53.411 --> 00:02:56.740
<v Speaker 2>their time than tweaking these digital</v>
<v Speaker 2>devices.</v>

63
00:02:56.741 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 2>They want them to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to enjoy them,</v>

64
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 2>they want to use them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not afraid of them.</v>

65
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 2>They're not new to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could be any age.</v>

66
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

67
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 2>if you're 16 and you have a lot of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>on your hands,</v>

68
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 2>you may want to screw around with trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fix your windows when it breaks.</v>

69
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.260
<v Speaker 2>If you're the same person in your 25 and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still are not afraid of the computer</v>

70
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 2>and you have a lot of technical</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>

71
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 2>you suddenly find you have a lot less</v>
<v Speaker 2>time on your hands to goof around with</v>

72
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it isn't a question of being dumb</v>

73
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 2>or smart or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or intimidated or not intimidated.</v>

74
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 2>It's a question of you bought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you bought the laptop.</v>

75
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 2>When you open it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you expect it to come on,</v>

76
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 2>you expect it to connect to the Wifi</v>
<v Speaker 2>network,</v>

77
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 2>you expect it to get you to the website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you expect it to deal with your email,</v>

78
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 2>expect to be able to play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

79
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your favorite game on it.</v>

80
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:52.620
<v Speaker 2>You expect to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

81
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll do facebook and my space and at</v>

82
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 2>the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to or need to,</v>

83
00:03:57.731 --> 00:03:58.880
<v Speaker 2>you expect to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

84
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

85
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 2>write a 50 page paper on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they promise you when they</v>

86
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 2>sell you the computer and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>promise you that you're going to be</v>

87
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 2>spending your time dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>defragging,</v>

88
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:16.591
<v Speaker 2>the hard drive and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>updating the security program and all</v>

89
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 2>that other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I have been laser focused on</v>

90
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first line of my first column was</v>

91
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 2>personal computers are just too hard to</v>
<v Speaker 2>use and it's not your fault.</v>

92
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 2>And I still think that's true and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

93
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true for a cell phones,</v>

94
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 2>which are like personal computers 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

95
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 2>It's true for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

96
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.040
<v Speaker 2>most of these products.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

97
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why I still have a</v>

98
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:45.701
<v Speaker 2>following.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

99
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:50.701
<v Speaker 2>I'm in widely read print and web and</v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcast outlets,</v>

100
00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 2>but I also constantly have adopted that</v>
<v Speaker 2>voice.</v>

101
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
