1
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was a desert island scenario and I</v>

2
00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:16.591
<v Speaker 1>like to take one font with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it would be Helvetica though</v>

3
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.250
<v Speaker 1>though it has its limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's incredibly versatile and,</v>

4
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.450
<v Speaker 1>and gets the job done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also think it's,</v>

5
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.610
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of the few typefaces</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will really survive the test of</v>

6
00:00:33.611 --> 00:00:35.080
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond the next several decades,</v>

8
00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:40.930
<v Speaker 1>if not into the next century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

9
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.690
<v Speaker 1>I think there's just something that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just really done right when that type</v>

10
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>face was put together and not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it,</v>

11
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conversation that,</v>

12
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.040
<v Speaker 1>that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.900
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>grew around Helvetica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially over the past,</v>

15
00:00:55.741 --> 00:00:59.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years ago has really solidified as</v>

16
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.720
<v Speaker 1>a timeless classic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the one I would take with me.</v>

17
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

18
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.560
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not the only one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

19
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.270
<v Speaker 1>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if press,</v>

20
00:01:07.271 --> 00:01:08.104
<v Speaker 1>that would be the one.</v>

21
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.050
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our colleagues over at the Guardian are</v>

24
00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:22.430
<v Speaker 1>doing a really great job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.550
<v Speaker 1>with their news presentation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

26
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>the art director over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

29
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.243
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Porter,</v>

30
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Mark Porter over at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the Guardian,</v>

31
00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I think he's doing a terrific job with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.800
<v Speaker 1>the news presentation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy who came from a print</v>

33
00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:44.290
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a art director from the newspaper</v>

34
00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:48.310
<v Speaker 1>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I really like about that</v>

35
00:01:48.311 --> 00:01:52.030
<v Speaker 1>example is he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>quite modest in coming to the web and</v>
<v Speaker 1>really understood that it required him</v>

37
00:01:57.821 --> 00:02:00.790
<v Speaker 1>to really immerse himself for a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not,</v>

38
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several years to really get the medium.</v>

39
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.110
<v Speaker 1>And the results are really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

40
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite amazing.</v>

41
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

42
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very nicely controlled evenly,</v>

43
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

44
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of executed,</v>

45
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>news experience over there that,</v>

46
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.880
<v Speaker 1>that at the same time really respects</v>
<v Speaker 1>users' needs and goals and responds to</v>

47
00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:25.090
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

48
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.740
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's terrific.</v>

49
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time they have a different</v>

50
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.030
<v Speaker 1>economic situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the times does,</v>

51
00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:32.980
<v Speaker 1>which I'm quite jealous of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

52
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.020
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to accommodate the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the advertising units that we do.</v>

53
00:02:38.021 --> 00:02:38.854
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

54
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.020
<v Speaker 1>so part of that is jealousy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

55
00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:45.280
<v Speaker 1>I also think over it and why mag.com New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York magazine's site,</v>

56
00:02:45.281 --> 00:02:46.120
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Ian Adelman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.890
<v Speaker 1>the design director there is doing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really terrific job,</v>

59
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.820
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

61
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.430
<v Speaker 1>a site that's not that different from</v>
<v Speaker 1>ours,</v>

62
00:02:57.431 --> 00:02:59.910
<v Speaker 1>but is I think infused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>a lot more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

64
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>sort of playfulness then the times is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

66
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:07.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>has just done a terrific job over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past few years.</v>

68
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.190
<v Speaker 1>creating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 1>a site that's really full of character</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think really,</v>

71
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.110
<v Speaker 1>really accurately translates the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personality of the print magazine to</v>

72
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>the web without being slavish to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>print side.</v>

73
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
