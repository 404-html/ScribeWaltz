00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.760
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people just assume that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to make more intelligent just to</v>

2
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>make them more human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

3
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a very dubious</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption.</v>

4
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I think we're much better off with tools</v>
<v Speaker 1>with colleagues.</v>

5
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.460
<v Speaker 1>We can make tools that are smart as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dickens and use them and understand what</v>

6
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:38.760
<v Speaker 1>their limitations are without giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>them ulterior motives,</v>

7
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.240
<v Speaker 1>purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a drive to exist and to compete and to</v>

8
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>beat the others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are features that don't play any</v>

9
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.680
<v Speaker 1>crucial role in the competences of</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence,</v>

10
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>so for Heaven Sakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't bother putting them in.</v>

11
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.170
<v Speaker 1>Leave all that out and what we have is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart things that we can treat like</v>

12
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>slaves and it's quite all right to treat</v>
<v Speaker 1>them as less because they.</v>

13
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>They don't have feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not conscious.</v>

14
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 1>You can turn them off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tear them apart the same way you</v>

15
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>can with an automobile and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way we should keep it.</v>

16
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Now that we're in the age of intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 1>design,</v>

17
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.670
<v Speaker 1>lots of intelligent designers around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them are intelligent enough to</v>

18
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>realize that Oracle's second rule is</v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

19
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Evolution is cleverer than you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Francis Crick's,</v>

20
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>famous quip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what they're doing is harnessing</v>

21
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.880
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary processes to do the heavy</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting without human help,</v>

22
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.810
<v Speaker 1>so we have all these deep learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems and they kind of in the</v>

23
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.140
<v Speaker 1>varieties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's basie and networks and and a</v>

24
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>reinforcement learning of various sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of deep,</v>

25
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.160
<v Speaker 1>deep learning neural networks and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>these computer systems have in common is</v>

26
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>that they are competent without</v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehension.</v>

27
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Google translate doesn't know what he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about when it translates a bit</v>

28
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>of Turkish into a bit of English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to.</v>

29
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not as good as the translation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bilingual can do,</v>

30
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's good enough for most purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's happening in many fields in</v>

31
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>this new wave of ai is the creation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

32
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Black boxes where you know that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>probability of getting the right answer</v>

33
00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:45.030
<v Speaker 1>is very high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are extremely good.</v>

34
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>They're better than human beings at</v>
<v Speaker 1>churning through the data and coming up</v>

35
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>with the right answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't understand how they do</v>

36
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody understands in detail how they do</v>

37
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:57.400
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

38
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>but he has to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've created entities which are his</v>

39
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:07.081
<v Speaker 1>inscrutable to us as a bird or a mammal</v>
<v Speaker 1>considered as a collection of cells.</v>

40
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>This inscrutable is still a lot we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand about what makes them tick</v>

41
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>and we can use these products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these intellectual products without</v>

42
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:23.761
<v Speaker 1>knowing quite how they're generated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but knowing having a good responsible</v>

43
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>reasons for believing that they will</v>
<v Speaker 1>generate the truth.</v>

44
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no existing computer system,</v>

45
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>no matter how good it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that answering questions like Watson on</v>

46
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:40.600
<v Speaker 1>jeopardy knows how the system is</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious today,</v>

47
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>not close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And although I think it's possible in</v>

48
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 1>principle to make a conscious android,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conscious robot,</v>

49
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's desirable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there would be great</v>

50
00:03:56.021 --> 00:04:01.021
<v Speaker 1>benefits to doing this and there'll be</v>
<v Speaker 1>some significant harms and dangerous to</v>

51
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.980
<v Speaker 1>you could at tremendous expense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'd have to have in fact that</v>

52
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 1>quite a quite a revolution in in</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer design,</v>

53
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 1>which would take you right down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right down to the very base of the</v>

54
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>hardware.</v>
