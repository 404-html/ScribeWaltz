1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.300
<v Speaker 1>I like this new wave of feminine crime</v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction writers who are feminist but not</v>

2
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.300
<v Speaker 1>in the upg politically correct way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminism is an authentic feminism.</v>

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have this pattern ising</v>

4
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.660
<v Speaker 1>attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

5
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.260
<v Speaker 1>women should always be passive victims</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>But even maybe now I will say something</v>
<v Speaker 1>for rich,</v>

8
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:31.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe I not be popular here even better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than how she called Gillian Flynn or</v>

9
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:36.411
<v Speaker 1>what is an Irish girl called Tana</v>
<v Speaker 1>French?</v>

10
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.200
<v Speaker 1>A theories of crime fiction taking place</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Dublin with more or less the same</v>

11
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same attitude.</v>

12
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>A kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I have to invent some stupid title,</v>

13
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:54.290
<v Speaker 1>a kind of a dark New York feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.373
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>crime thrillers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But know of the,</v>

16
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>of the movie that I recently saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a problem.</v>

17
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Often a movie attracts me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not attract me,</v>

18
00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:13.221
<v Speaker 1>but gives me to think intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't really like it.</v>

19
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a movie for example,</v>

20
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one,</v>

21
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her with your,</v>

22
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.180
<v Speaker 1>when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>in the field at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she is the hero together with the girl,</v>

24
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I think she's called amy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are both abandoned by their</v>

25
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.630
<v Speaker 1>machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big enigma here is,</v>

26
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:38.631
<v Speaker 1>and this is what always attracted me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is I think what my mentor in</v>

27
00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French tracker and list Jacques Lacan in</v>

28
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in his crazy fees is there is no</v>

29
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>sexual relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means we are never alone.</v>

30
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Me and my partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has to be a third element as</v>

31
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>fantasy scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an intruder.</v>

32
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.180
<v Speaker 1>It's only through that mediation of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>third element here in her,</v>

33
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.110
<v Speaker 1>their operating systems that sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>functions.</v>

34
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 1>And then I started to think about other</v>
<v Speaker 1>variations of this.</v>

35
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a perfect there intelligently mate,</v>

36
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.600
<v Speaker 1>20 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>British publicity for beer,</v>

37
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>which is a var,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful,</v>

38
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>ironic repetition of a old fairy tale</v>
<v Speaker 1>motive.</v>

39
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a young girl walks by a stream,</v>

40
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.140
<v Speaker 1>she's a frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's what you do in</v>

41
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 1>fairy tales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She picks up and kisses the frog and the</v>

42
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:43.971
<v Speaker 1>frog into a prince charming young man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the publicity goes on.</v>

43
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.970
<v Speaker 1>The charming Yank man looks at her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kisses her and she turns into a can of</v>

44
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:53.250
<v Speaker 1>beer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

45
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 1>like that's what he really wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.160
<v Speaker 1>and then I found here in the states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and similar but inverted versions,</v>

47
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>some pretty disgusting mentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>publicity for Taco Bell publicity for</v>

48
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>something called Casa Ardito,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is Kisa Delia in Burrito</v>

49
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 1>combination of the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's presented in such an obscene</v>

50
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.600
<v Speaker 1>way that if you combine the two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really like a penis in wrapped by a</v>

51
00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:24.270
<v Speaker 1>vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if,</v>

52
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>how is the publicity spot down here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

53
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>a young guy and the girl see during</v>
<v Speaker 1>lunch break at a table,</v>

54
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>one has guess ideally at the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burrito and they look at each other and</v>

55
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:41.551
<v Speaker 1>then you see each person's dream boy</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks at her and imageries the future.</v>

56
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 1>They start to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get married,</v>

57
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>have children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then she looks at him,</v>

58
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.690
<v Speaker 1>approach him in her dream and take his</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of Burrito or whatever.</v>

59
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what apps keep apps that she gets a kind</v>

60
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>of a bisexual completing and just makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sign and he disappears.</v>

61
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's similar to that word beer,</v>

62
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.090
<v Speaker 1>but what I think is the deep enigma</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind all this.</v>

63
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Why do we never get just a couple?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why it always has to be some intruders</v>

64
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 1>and the best Hollywood version of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ask all the viewers</v>

65
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>who are watching us now to to download,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can download it for free.</v>

66
00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 1>It's an American classic movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Preston Sturgis Lady Eve,</v>

67
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 1>where you have the ultimate marriage</v>
<v Speaker 1>proposal scene.</v>

68
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.320
<v Speaker 1>You have a Henry Fonda and Barbara</v>
<v Speaker 1>stanwyck and a horse standing behind</v>

69
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 1>them and the horse's head is always</v>
<v Speaker 1>intruding and so on and so on.</v>

70
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 1>That is the mystery of sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never too,</v>

71
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 1>you always need something and imagined</v>
<v Speaker 1>gaze,</v>

72
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>an element intruding and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so on.</v>
