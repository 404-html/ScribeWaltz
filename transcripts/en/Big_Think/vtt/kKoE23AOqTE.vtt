1
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we we,</v>

2
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 1>we are still hopeful that President</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama will make,</v>

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>will keep the promises he made his</v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate,</v>

4
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>but there was some early signs that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going down the right path.</v>

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>He told us we would reject the military</v>
<v Speaker 1>commissions act,</v>

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>and yet now he's talking about retaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>the military commissions as a way to</v>

7
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 1>deal with some of the detainees at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guantanamo.</v>

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Huge mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't fix that.</v>

9
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>You got scrap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It got throw these individuals and to</v>

10
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:36.690
<v Speaker 1>establish courts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't tinker at the edges with the</v>

11
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Military Commissions Act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told us he would restore the rule of</v>

12
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>law and yet now he's telling us that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to elect a preventive detention</v>

13
00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially a nice word for</v>

14
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:48.240
<v Speaker 1>holding people indefinitely without</v>
<v Speaker 1>charge or trial.</v>

15
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the American way.</v>

16
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>We've never allowed that for hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

17
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.460
<v Speaker 1>America cannot hold people who we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicious of merely because they may</v>

18
00:00:58.741 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>pose a threat.</v>

19
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>If you can't prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't take away someone's</v>

20
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:06.831
<v Speaker 1>fundamental right to liberty and do so</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that doesn't a convict the</v>

21
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>person in a court of law that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's anathema to the fourth and fifth</v>

22
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>amendments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the president telling us that</v>

23
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:19.611
<v Speaker 1>he was going to make good on some core</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues around gay rights and questions</v>

24
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:24.400
<v Speaker 1>around equality in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seemed to be very slow in coming.</v>

25
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:25.803
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>saying that I'm going to give gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lesbian people.</v>

27
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>They're full rights as individuals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet defending the defensive marriage</v>

28
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't compute,</v>

29
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

30
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if those promises were made,</v>

31
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 1>you can't defend the defense of marriage</v>
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>

32
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>You can't drag your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ask,</v>

33
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>don't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the concerns we have</v>

34
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>is that the president is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have all these other issues that are</v>

35
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 1>on the front burner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economy,</v>

36
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>the wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare.</v>

37
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>We all get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all Americans.</v>

38
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:59.340
<v Speaker 1>We all care about people dying in wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all care about health care,</v>

39
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>we all care about the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but frankly we can't wait to fix all</v>

40
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>those problems before we get to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>really important problems.</v>

41
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

42
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>he and he alone in his garment</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflicts.</v>

43
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.780
<v Speaker 1>You can't sequence in a way that's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

44
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.300
<v Speaker 1>You got to fix the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the healthcare and the environment and</v>

45
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>the wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll turn to gay people and</v>

46
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>the administration of Justice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>detainees and torture and abuse.</v>

47
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

48
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>we're never going to get to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And frankly everyone knows that it's the</v>

49
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:31.370
<v Speaker 1>first 18 months of an administration</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will allow him the room and the</v>

50
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>latitude to make decisive breaks with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>

51
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>And unless we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we occupied that initial window with</v>

52
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:39.450
<v Speaker 1>some really bold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisive actions,</v>

53
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.060
<v Speaker 1>we'll find ourselves in a new reelection</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>

54
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>We'll find ourselves with pundits on</v>
<v Speaker 1>both sides saying differ these issues</v>

55
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:50.961
<v Speaker 1>further until the second term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And frankly a dream deferred is a dream</v>

56
00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And frankly a time is not a luxury we</v>

57
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 1>can afford ourselves when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>core issues like due process and human</v>

58
00:02:57.601 --> 00:03:00.960
<v Speaker 1>rights and equality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why we're hoping by putting</v>

59
00:03:00.961 --> 00:03:04.500
<v Speaker 1>his feet to the fire and these issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>that who get the political will to do</v>

60
00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:04.950
<v Speaker 1>the right thing.</v>
