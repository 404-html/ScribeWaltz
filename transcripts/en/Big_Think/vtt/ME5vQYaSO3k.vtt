1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.150
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

3
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:07.560
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many more.</v>

4
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:11.850
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds of eggs are fertilized then</v>
<v Speaker 2>become humans.</v>

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Eggs get fertilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by that I mean sperm get accepted by</v>

6
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 2>over a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not all you need.</v>

7
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 2>You have to attach to the uterine wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inside of the,</v>

8
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 2>of a womb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman's womb.</v>

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 2>But if you're going to hold that as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>standard,</v>

10
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 2>that is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to say when an egg is</v>

11
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 2>fertilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's therefore all has the same rights</v>

12
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 2>as an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then who are you going to?</v>

13
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.730
<v Speaker 2>Whom are you going to sue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whom are you going to imprison?</v>

14
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Every woman who's had a fertilized egg</v>
<v Speaker 2>pass through her,</v>

15
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Speaker 2>every guy whose sperm is fertilized an</v>
<v Speaker 2>egg and then it didn't become a human of</v>

16
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 2>all these people failed you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

17
00:00:56.821 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 2>it's just reflection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but deep scientific lack of</v>

18
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:03.610
<v Speaker 2>understanding and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

19
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.590
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he will do literally,</v>

20
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.560
<v Speaker 2>apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally don't know what you're talking</v>

21
00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:09.394
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

22
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.990
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

23
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to women's rights with</v>

24
00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:18.730
<v Speaker 2>respect to their reproduction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you should leave it to women.</v>

25
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.140
<v Speaker 2>This is really a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot help but notice,</v>

26
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the first guy to observe this.</v>

27
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 2>You have a lot of men of European</v>
<v Speaker 2>descent passing these extraordinary laws</v>

28
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 2>based on ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

29
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:37.990
<v Speaker 2>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it was written or your</v>

30
00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:40.840
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of a book written five</v>
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>

31
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.100
<v Speaker 2>5,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 centuries ago,</v>

32
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 2>makes you think that when a man and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman have sexual intercourse,</v>

33
00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:57.601
<v Speaker 2>they always have a baby that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so to pass laws based on that belief</v>

34
00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:02.500
<v Speaker 2>is inconsistent with nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

35
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.650
<v Speaker 2>it's hard not to get frustrated with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

36
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.820
<v Speaker 2>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

37
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.020
<v Speaker 2>and I know</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

38
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Nobody likes abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

39
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 2>But you can't tell somebody what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

40
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.300
<v Speaker 2>she has rights over this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if she doesn't like the guy</v>

41
00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:27.230
<v Speaker 2>that got her pregnant.</v>

42
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.440
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't want anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your genes.</v>

43
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Get over it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you were raped and all</v>

44
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.220
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

45
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very frustrating on the,</v>

46
00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:38.630
<v Speaker 2>on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the other side,</v>

47
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have so many more important things to</v>

48
00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:46.130
<v Speaker 2>be dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have so many more problems to</v>

49
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.840
<v Speaker 2>squander resources on this argument</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on bad science,</v>

50
00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:53.930
<v Speaker 2>on just lack of understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very frustrating.</v>

51
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.790
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't know how big a human egg</v>
<v Speaker 2>was if it weren't for microscopes.</v>

52
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 2>There weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For scientists who are medical</v>

53
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 2>researchers looking diligently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't know the process.</v>

54
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't have that shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the famous shot or shots where the sperm</v>

55
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 2>are bumping up against the egg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't have that without science.</v>

56
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 2>So then to claim that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next step when you obviously don't,</v>

57
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 2>it's trouble when you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

58
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 2>let me do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just pull back.</v>

59
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 2>At some point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to respect the facts.</v>

60
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Recommending or insisting on abstinence</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been completely ineffective.</v>

61
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.780
<v Speaker 2>Just being objective here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A closing abortion clinics,</v>

62
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 2>closing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

63
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 2>not getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving women access to birth control has</v>

64
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 2>not been an effective way to lead to</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthier societies.</v>

65
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

66
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 2>I think we all know that and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that you have deeply held</v>

67
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 2>beliefs and you want to and it really is</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately out of respect for people,</v>

68
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 2>in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your perception of unborn people.</v>

69
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 2>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really encourage you to look at</v>

70
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:05.100
<v Speaker 2>the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know people are now critical of</v>

71
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 2>the expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact based,</v>

72
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.960
<v Speaker 2>but what's wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's really encourage you to not tell</v>

73
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:19.141
<v Speaker 2>women what to do and not pursue these</v>
<v Speaker 2>laws that really are in nobody's best</v>

74
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:24.370
<v Speaker 2>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just really be objective about this.</v>

75
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 2>We have other problems to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody,</v>

76
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

77
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 2>let's work together.</v>
