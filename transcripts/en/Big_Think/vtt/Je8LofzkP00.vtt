1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I was teaching at University of Texas</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was teaching a class in</v>

2
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>interactive design and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was in the sort of late</v>

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>nineties and the Internet had had gotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>really big and my students were</v>

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>grappling with notions of interface</v>
<v Speaker 1>design and really trying to figure out</v>

5
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to,</v>

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 1>how do they engage users.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.120
<v Speaker 1>and so I brought in a project where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>began to study games and the students</v>

8
00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 1>began to design and redesign games as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to understand what is good</v>

9
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:31.130
<v Speaker 1>interactive design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is the first time that I'd</v>

10
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>actually brought games into my own</v>
<v Speaker 1>classroom space.</v>

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 1>And the first time that I took people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who'd never done game design and put</v>

12
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>them in the role of a game designer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a huge moment of discovery</v>

13
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:48.291
<v Speaker 1>for me because my students learn more</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how to engage an audience,</v>

14
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.230
<v Speaker 1>how to really communicate and how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create really interesting,</v>

15
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>unusual kinds of spaces when they used</v>
<v Speaker 1>game design as a starting point,</v>

16
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>even though they weren't designing</v>
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

17
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Eventually the process of thinking like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a game designer gave them a whole tool</v>

18
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tool set that they hadn't had</v>

19
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>previously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>and so that sort of set me along this</v>
<v Speaker 1>path where I began to say,</v>

21
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something just interesting in,</v>

22
00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:17.490
<v Speaker 1>in this act of teaching people to design</v>
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

23
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I began to work with kids.</v>

24
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.730
<v Speaker 1>And one of the most interesting thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens when you work with young</v>

25
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:28.731
<v Speaker 1>people in designing games is how deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go into the content.</v>

26
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 1>And so this is this question of where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the math and science,</v>

27
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff might come in.</v>

28
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.680
<v Speaker 1>When we look at kids and we talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that definition of who is a Gamer,</v>

29
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a really old definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There used to be a time when only a</v>

30
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>certain population of kids played games</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they tended to be boys and they</v>

31
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>tended to be kind of Geeky boys that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were hidden away in their basement.</v>

32
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.750
<v Speaker 1>The truth is today when you look at who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was playing games,</v>

33
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:57.870
<v Speaker 1>particularly younger kids up to about</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixth or seventh grade,</v>

34
00:01:57.871 --> 00:01:59.410
<v Speaker 1>it's all kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

35
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.520
<v Speaker 1>and most kids don't self identify</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves as gamers.</v>

36
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 1>If you ask them about that identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:09.720
<v Speaker 1>it's just something that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an assumption when we recruit</v>

38
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:12.810
<v Speaker 1>kids for the school that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all kids have to a greater or</v>

39
00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>lesser degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some experience playing games and an</v>

40
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.760
<v Speaker 1>interest in playing games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The school is not,</v>

41
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a vocational school that's</v>

42
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:21.990
<v Speaker 1>intended to graduate game designers.</v>

43
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>So that isn't actually any way that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about the school.</v>

44
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the kids that we get,</v>

45
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:32.871
<v Speaker 1>our kids that are deeply interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

46
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.570
<v Speaker 1>a school that might feel a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>different than a traditional school,</v>

47
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to be really creative kids,</v>

48
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

49
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in ideas that they'll have a</v>

50
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>chance to design stuff and make stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>they're kids that tend to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.220
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>high performing and having strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>interests.</v>

54
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.570
<v Speaker 1>And those interests don't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be games,</v>

55
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:57.450
<v Speaker 1>but they might be interested in reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they might be interested in sports,</v>

56
00:02:57.451 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>but they're kids that get passionate</v>
<v Speaker 1>about something,</v>

57
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get excited about a school that</v>

58
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>might help them cultivate that passion.</v>

59
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>So at the model at quest is that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers collaborate with game designers</v>

60
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>to design the curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no expectation that teachers</v>

61
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 1>have to be game designers in the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's no expectation that the</v>

62
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>game designers are going to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>classroom teaching day to day with the</v>

63
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

64
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:24.910
<v Speaker 1>so the teachers that we recruited mostly</v>
<v Speaker 1>came from the public school system.</v>

65
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>We have a couple that taught at private</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools previously.</v>

66
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of them had a game design</v>

67
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

68
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>a few of them had an interesting games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them had a background in</v>

69
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:37.940
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

70
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 1>but all of them were strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>collaborators,</v>

71
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>had worked in context where</v>
<v Speaker 1>collaboration was key.</v>

72
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.340
<v Speaker 1>All of them were deeply interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the craft of,</v>

73
00:03:47.341 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 1>of learning and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how to really work with kids.</v>

74
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of them were open to the idea</v>

75
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:53.404
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

76
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.830
<v Speaker 1>being a curriculum designer and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.540
<v Speaker 1>working with game designers and trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see where this model could,</v>

78
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:00.070
<v Speaker 1>could really take learning for kids.</v>

79
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 1>I would say that it's not so much among</v>
<v Speaker 1>our parents,</v>

80
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because any open house or talk that they</v>

81
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:13.870
<v Speaker 1>might come to you where they hear about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the school becomes really clear how</v>

82
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about games and how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>value them.</v>

83
00:04:16.421 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>But there is a larger cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse,</v>

84
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think is quite limited around</v>

85
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:26.140
<v Speaker 1>this issue of what's the value of games</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's the value of play and video</v>

86
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:29.800
<v Speaker 1>games in particular because they've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>covered I think historically in the</v>

87
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 1>media</v>
<v Speaker 1>as either a games that are about</v>

88
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 1>violence or games that are about wasting</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

89
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two kind of dominant</v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives that people that don't know</v>

90
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>much about games here again and again</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again.</v>

91
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.030
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a bit of a default</v>
<v Speaker 1>position that people fall into just</v>

92
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Speaker 1>because they haven't perhaps really</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about it.</v>

93
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any parent that,</v>

94
00:04:56.321 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 1>that we have that has a child that</v>
<v Speaker 1>spends an amount of time gaming at home</v>

95
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 1>actually understands something about why</v>
<v Speaker 1>that child is gaming and what they're</v>

96
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:06.634
<v Speaker 1>getting out of it.</v>

97
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 1>And partially it is because they talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids.</v>

98
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those reasons really vary.</v>

99
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the value of the gaming is,</v>

100
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the,</v>

101
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>the social structure and the community</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the kids have.</v>

102
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.630
<v Speaker 1>We find that that gaming is less about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the artifact of the game itself and more</v>

103
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:25.990
<v Speaker 1>about the community that sort of sits</v>
<v Speaker 1>around that game and that players are</v>

104
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:28.840
<v Speaker 1>part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for many parents that social piece</v>

105
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:31.010
<v Speaker 1>is pretty big for kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

106
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.740
<v Speaker 1>for other parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a opportunity around creativity</v>

107
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.630
<v Speaker 1>that they see happening in these games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also see their kids persisting on</v>

108
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:43.600
<v Speaker 1>problems and games that they don't see</v>
<v Speaker 1>them persisting on another other spaces</v>

109
00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:48.520
<v Speaker 1>and they begin to recognize that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>persistence and tenacity is actually</v>

110
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:51.970
<v Speaker 1>something pretty important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really know how to make it</v>

111
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 1>happen in other kinds of spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they see their kids doing that and</v>

112
00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:56.621
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

113
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 1>if I can get my kid to do that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're working on math,</v>

114
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 1>be that persistent.</v>

115
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>There's something really valuable there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

116
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 1>so I think it's more this general</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural dialog that's pretty,</v>

117
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty narrow and pretty underdeveloped</v>

118
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 1>at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in part of the goal of this school</v>

119
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:14.511
<v Speaker 1>as well as some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 1>a lot of other people doing work in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>space is to try to complexify the</v>

121
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:19.260
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

122
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.230
<v Speaker 1>and begin to understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>historically from the moment that human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings sort of came into existence,</v>

124
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:29.630
<v Speaker 1>play was a part of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a profound part of what makes us</v>

125
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 1>human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a profound part of what keeps the</v>

126
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 1>community together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A profound part of ways in which we can</v>

127
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:40.991
<v Speaker 1>deal with complex issues that are maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>too complicated to deal with outside a</v>

128
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:42.880
<v Speaker 1>kind of play space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

129
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.410
<v Speaker 1>and so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion and value of play</v>

130
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:49.100
<v Speaker 1>historically has been huge and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make sense to me today why we</v>

131
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:50.770
<v Speaker 1>would dismiss it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

132
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 1>because it's something that we see</v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied in a way that maybe we don't</v>

133
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:57.410
<v Speaker 1>understanding and understanding some</v>
<v Speaker 1>digital games that,</v>

134
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for many people look kind of scary.</v>
