1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.840
<v Speaker 1>So millennials are a generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we define them as having been born after</v>

2
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>1980,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the oldest of them is in his or her</v>

3
00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 1>early thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The youngest mid teenagers,</v>

4
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>typically generations last about 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years or so.</v>

5
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>We don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the back half of this generation</v>

6
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 1>ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a 12 or 13 year old</v>

7
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>who's somebody different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he or she hasn't quite come of age</v>

8
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:23.970
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very distinctive generation and</v>

9
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:27.210
<v Speaker 1>the oldest of them has now made the</v>
<v Speaker 1>passage into adulthood.</v>

10
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:30.810
<v Speaker 1>So we know a little bit more about them</v>
<v Speaker 1>than we did eight or 10 years ago when</v>

11
00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>they first came on the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Distinctive.</v>

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Speaker 1>They're very large generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time the 20 year cycle is done,</v>

13
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 1>they'll probably be 80 million strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The largest generation since the baby</v>

14
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>boomers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are very distinctive racially and</v>

15
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>ethnically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:50.451
<v Speaker 1>they are the transitional generation in</v>
<v Speaker 1>an America that in the middle of the</v>

17
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>last century was about 85 percent white</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the middle of this century will be</v>

18
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:58.790
<v Speaker 1>only a little more than 40 percent white</v>
<v Speaker 1>millennials are that are the most non</v>

19
00:00:58.791 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>white generation.</v>

20
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.840
<v Speaker 1>There's more than four in 10 are</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonwhite.</v>

21
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is driven by the great modern</v>

22
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>immigration wave that's now about four</v>
<v Speaker 1>or five decades old,</v>

23
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.430
<v Speaker 1>unlike our earlier immigration waves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are almost entirely from Europe.</v>

24
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.850
<v Speaker 1>This immigration wave is mostly from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin American,</v>

25
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Asian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the immigrants themselves,</v>

26
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:18.810
<v Speaker 1>but more so now it's the children of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants,</v>

27
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US born children of the immigrants</v>

28
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:23.730
<v Speaker 1>who make up a very heavy portion of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>millennial generation.</v>

29
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>They're just thinking distinctive</v>
<v Speaker 1>politically.</v>

30
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've now,</v>

31
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>they're now old enough to an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a vote it in two or three</v>

32
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:32.570
<v Speaker 1>presidential elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were a very big part of both of</v>

33
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>President Obama's victories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 1>by our calculation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pew Research Center where I work and</v>

35
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 1>did a lot of the research that led to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this book.</v>

36
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>They are the most democratic voting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a generation of young adults,</v>

37
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:47.520
<v Speaker 1>of any that we have seen in 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 years of tracking,</v>

38
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>of voting patterns.</v>

39
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very liberal in their social and</v>

40
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Speaker 1>cultural values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some of the changes that are going on</v>

41
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:57.300
<v Speaker 1>in the country on issues like same sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage,</v>

42
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legalization,</v>

43
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 1>actually pretty dramatic changes in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly short period of time in terms of</v>

44
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:05.250
<v Speaker 1>public attitudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the millennials,</v>

45
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>it's the young adults who are leading</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

46
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>despite their distinctive political and</v>
<v Speaker 1>social views and voting behaviors.</v>

47
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are not terribly attached to the</v>

48
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Democratic Party even though they gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>big votes the Democratic presidential</v>

49
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:20.380
<v Speaker 1>candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

50
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>when we ask adults of all ages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>are you a Democrat or Republican or an</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent?</v>

52
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Millennials have 50 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>millennials say I'm independent.</v>

53
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.580
<v Speaker 1>We've never seen that high a share from</v>
<v Speaker 1>any age cohort.</v>

54
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.820
<v Speaker 1>We see a similar thing when we ask about</v>
<v Speaker 1>their religion or you know,</v>

55
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 1>what are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protestant,</v>

56
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim,</v>

57
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:39.624
<v Speaker 1>Hindu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish,</v>

58
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>a record share of millennials say on</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing in particular.</v>

59
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>And there's a third anchor institution</v>
<v Speaker 1>of society,</v>

60
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that millennials are not attached to.</v>

61
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's a little old 5,000 year</v>
<v Speaker 1>institution called marriage.</v>

62
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so of today's 18 to 33 year old is only</v>

63
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.070
<v Speaker 1>about a quarter are married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go back to older generations,</v>

64
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>they were the same age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five and 10,</v>

65
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>six and 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oldest generation,</v>

66
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 1>more than six and 10 were married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the slow walk toward marriage</v>

67
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>and the and the disassociation from</v>
<v Speaker 1>anchor institutions I think are</v>

68
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>explained by first their economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

69
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Another distinctive thing about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation is they're the first in</v>

70
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>modern American history and perhaps the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first in American history that at least</v>

71
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 1>so far we don't know how their story</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends,</v>

72
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>but we know how the story of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic lives have begun and at least</v>

73
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 1>so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the first generation in modern</v>

74
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>times that is doing less well</v>
<v Speaker 1>economically than their parents'</v>

75
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 1>generation on any way you measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's income,</v>

76
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>whether it's wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's poverty,</v>

77
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 1>whether it's employment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployment,</v>

78
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 1>all the classic measures and you correct</v>
<v Speaker 1>for inflation and you'll make it an</v>

79
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>apples to apples comparison.</v>

80
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.500
<v Speaker 1>They're doing less well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

81
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>The fact that they're doing less well</v>
<v Speaker 1>means a lot of them.</v>

82
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 1>When we asked them who those were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who aren't married,</v>

83
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>would you like to marry almost seven in</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 say yes.</v>

84
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Why haven't you gotten married?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

85
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 1>look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a career,</v>

87
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the economic foundation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get married.</v>

88
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that will reverberate in interesting</v>

89
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 1>ways as they mature into middle age and</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond.</v>

90
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.120
<v Speaker 1>And then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

91
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 1>perhaps if not the most distinctive</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing about this generation,</v>

92
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>certainly one of the most distinctive</v>
<v Speaker 1>things is they are first generation of</v>

93
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 1>digital natives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they are the only age group of adults</v>

94
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 1>now for whom those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these amazing gadgets we now all hold in</v>

95
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:32.920
<v Speaker 1>our hand and we all take for granted</v>
<v Speaker 1>that with three clicks you can,</v>

96
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 1>you can access the sum of all human</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and frankly these days,</v>

97
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:39.040
<v Speaker 1>if it takes you a third click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wondering what takes so long.</v>

98
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.460
<v Speaker 1>So somebody my age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is jaw dropping,</v>

99
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 1>it's still jaw dropping every time I</v>
<v Speaker 1>access these information platforms and</v>

100
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 1>do it in mobile sites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

101
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just amazed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these young adults are not amazed.</v>

102
00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the only world they've ever known.</v>

103
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.350
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

104
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>they are carnivores in terms of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>habits with,</v>

105
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.310
<v Speaker 1>with these information systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just for information acquisition,</v>

106
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>but for the creation of networks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They organize their social lives around</v>

107
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 1>these networks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can build their own tribes.</v>

108
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Somebody more clever than me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>described them as a pri.</v>

109
00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Copernican generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

110
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.010
<v Speaker 1>the universe really does revolve around</v>
<v Speaker 1>them because they can build their social</v>

111
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>networks and they can place themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the center of their social networks</v>

112
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:27.520
<v Speaker 1>because their social networks are built</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the things they care the most</v>

113
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's their hobbies,</v>

114
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 1>whether it's their work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the games I like to play,</v>

115
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 1>whether it's information seeking in all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest.</v>

116
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.240
<v Speaker 1>This behavior has led some to suggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a narcissistic generation.</v>

117
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 1>My own view is that that's a bum rap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

118
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it's all about the new platforms</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's all about the human condition.</v>

119
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 1>And if you have the ability to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>place yourself at the center of the</v>

120
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:52.600
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will take it.</v>

121
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:54.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's empowering.</v>

122
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>It may lead to another trade of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>millennials.</v>

123
00:05:58.221 --> 00:06:00.230
<v Speaker 1>They're somewhat distrustful of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

124
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.490
<v Speaker 1>And it may be because as they navigate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the online world,</v>

125
00:06:03.491 --> 00:06:06.520
<v Speaker 1>it turns out not everybody is exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>who they say they are.</v>

126
00:06:06.521 --> 00:06:08.470
<v Speaker 1>And there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain wariness about this</v>

127
00:06:08.471 --> 00:06:11.710
<v Speaker 1>generation and I think there's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting question about whether the</v>

128
00:06:11.711 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 1>networks that they build online with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

129
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.270
<v Speaker 1>the median millennial has a 250 a quote</v>
<v Speaker 1>unquote friends on facebook.</v>

130
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Somebody my age or older has only a one</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifth,</v>

131
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.200
<v Speaker 1>that amount of friends and many fewer of</v>
<v Speaker 1>us are on facebook.</v>

132
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.330
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.190
<v Speaker 1>discuss among yourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has there been a quantum leap in human</v>

134
00:06:30.191 --> 00:06:31.030
<v Speaker 1>friendliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

135
00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:35.200
<v Speaker 1>over the fast few generations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it simply that the new platforms</v>

136
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.680
<v Speaker 1>create new behaviors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

137
00:06:37.681 --> 00:06:39.790
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and new ways of organizing your social</v>

138
00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:41.080
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's clearly the latter.</v>

139
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.080
<v Speaker 1>I think an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we know the answer to it</v>

140
00:06:44.081 --> 00:06:47.470
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is as millennials age more into,</v>

141
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.180
<v Speaker 1>into middle age as they probably age</v>
<v Speaker 1>into some of the more traditional anchor</v>

142
00:06:52.181 --> 00:06:54.820
<v Speaker 1>institutions of society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage,</v>

143
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.120
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>home ownership and all the rest.</v>

144
00:06:58.121 --> 00:06:59.710
<v Speaker 1>And these things are all happening more</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly.</v>

145
00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:03.280
<v Speaker 1>For millennials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will they establish a more of an offline</v>

146
00:07:03.281 --> 00:07:07.030
<v Speaker 1>network that begins to resemble the</v>
<v Speaker 1>networks and the affiliations and</v>

147
00:07:07.031 --> 00:07:09.790
<v Speaker 1>associations that their parents and</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandparents at all?</v>
