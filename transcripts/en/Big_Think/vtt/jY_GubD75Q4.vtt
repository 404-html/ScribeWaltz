1
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conventional wisdom kind of idea?</v>

2
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.790
<v Speaker 2>This is like the greatest period of</v>
<v Speaker 2>technological change in history</v>

3
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 2>and certainly by some measures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there have been immense changes that are</v>

4
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 2>hard to imagine.</v>

5
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.500
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.400
<v Speaker 2>having been matched in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we said earlier in this interview,</v>

7
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that there's been a period</v>
<v Speaker 2>of time when people have so rapidly</v>

8
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:41.391
<v Speaker 2>gained access to so much information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there've been other big eras where</v>

9
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.150
<v Speaker 2>technology change very fast to beginning</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the last century when the automobile,</v>

10
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:49.380
<v Speaker 2>the airplane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Telegraph,</v>

11
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 2>all these things came along very</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>

12
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 2>The telephone,</v>

13
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

14
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.960
<v Speaker 2>even further back in history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>various developments in medicine and</v>

15
00:00:58.961 --> 00:01:03.370
<v Speaker 2>sanitation and other things that really</v>
<v Speaker 2>had huge outcomes in the way people</v>

16
00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:07.300
<v Speaker 2>lived and worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what gets me up every morning is</v>

17
00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:10.270
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am living in one of those periods.</v>

18
00:01:10.271 --> 00:01:13.120
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter to me that it's the</v>

19
00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:17.920
<v Speaker 2>biggest or the fastest or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those periods of amazing</v>

20
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:19.960
<v Speaker 2>technological change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

21
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 2>I work for a publication that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>respected and that has resources for me</v>

22
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:29.560
<v Speaker 2>to cover these changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I get to,</v>

23
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see a lot of these things,</v>

24
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.680
<v Speaker 2>not only early but in the context of how</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were developed.</v>

25
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.020
<v Speaker 2>The developers come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

26
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.350
<v Speaker 2>they want me to write about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we have a conversation about why</v>

27
00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.150
<v Speaker 2>didn't you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you come to doing this?</v>

28
00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:45.850
<v Speaker 2>What was your idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love talking about it.</v>

29
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 2>I love listening to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also gives me a chance to meet a</v>

30
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.290
<v Speaker 2>important I people I think are important</v>
<v Speaker 2>historical figures the way that I used</v>

31
00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:59.130
<v Speaker 2>to when I covered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I used to go to the White House</v>

32
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.840
<v Speaker 2>sites to go to the Kremlin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to go to all these places,</v>

33
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.600
<v Speaker 2>10 Downing Street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these various places.</v>

34
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I go to Google,</v>

35
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.770
<v Speaker 2>I go to Microsoft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to apple.</v>

36
00:02:08.771 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

37
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.800
<v Speaker 2>have spent many hours of conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the years,</v>

38
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with people like Bill Gates and Steve</v>

39
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Jobs and the guys who founded Google and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

40
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Steve case who founded AOL and numerous</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

41
00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:26.170
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

42
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.130
<v Speaker 2>I've learned a lot from that and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it must have been,</v>

43
00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:33.370
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would've been like if you had sort of</v>

44
00:02:33.371 --> 00:02:38.371
<v Speaker 2>modern journalism covering Henry Ford or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Edison or whatever.</v>

45
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.070
<v Speaker 2>So that gets me up in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>
