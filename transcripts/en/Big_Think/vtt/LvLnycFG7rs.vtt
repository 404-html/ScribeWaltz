1
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.070
<v Speaker 1>My inner revolution book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:12.550
<v Speaker 1>I still think that definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're just subverted that we're,</v>

3
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.110
<v Speaker 1>we're under the control of warmongers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a moment of war criminals.</v>

4
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.890
<v Speaker 2>They are controlling us and taking all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the money and taking all their energy</v>

5
00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:23.050
<v Speaker 2>and had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've controlled the media propaganda</v>

6
00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:26.980
<v Speaker 2>vehicle and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've turned it into basically and uh,</v>

7
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

8
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.080
<v Speaker 2>but they are kind of desperate though</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they had been had but they're</v>

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 2>not getting anywhere and the people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting more and more sick of it and</v>

10
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:38.390
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the people are,</v>

11
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.190
<v Speaker 2>have been for fooled into it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>frightened into it in various ways.</v>

12
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.050
<v Speaker 2>But I think that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's the darkness before the</v>

13
00:00:47.051 --> 00:00:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

14
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.980
<v Speaker 2>I think the people will really refuse at</v>
<v Speaker 2>some point at this rate,</v>

15
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because um,</v>

16
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Cold War and they were kind of happy</v>

17
00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:57.940
<v Speaker 2>in the Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these criminal people because they had a</v>

18
00:00:57.941 --> 00:01:00.460
<v Speaker 2>big enemy that they could promote that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were afraid of.</v>

19
00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 2>They were very unhappy at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 2>World War II because we won.</v>

20
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.790
<v Speaker 2>So therefore they was no need to always</v>
<v Speaker 2>in American history before that.</v>

21
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.110
<v Speaker 2>As Gore Vidal brilliantly says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we always demobilized,</v>

22
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.270
<v Speaker 2>but in 47 truman and others decided that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would create this enemy and the</v>

23
00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Russians are former great allies who</v>
<v Speaker 2>helped us beat the Germans.</v>

24
00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Actually in the Italian was really good</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian,</v>

25
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.230
<v Speaker 2>we're a major factor and they were our</v>
<v Speaker 2>major allies and suddenly it turned them</v>

26
00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:30.220
<v Speaker 2>into the devil and the a threatened them</v>
<v Speaker 2>with nuke our nuclear weapons,</v>

27
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.800
<v Speaker 2>which then caused them to like build up</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear.</v>

28
00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:34.150
<v Speaker 2>Then we could have an arms race for</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

29
00:01:34.151 --> 00:01:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Then make them an enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then have all these proxy wars and the</v>

30
00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:40.420
<v Speaker 2>happy days for the military have 40</v>
<v Speaker 2>years of cold war.</v>

31
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Then finally it stopped and they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what to do.</v>

32
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.380
<v Speaker 2>They're doing Bush one no more cold war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no more things.</v>

33
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.330
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even Bush one had the temerity,</v>

34
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.410
<v Speaker 2>the old warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a CIA guy that he is to say we might</v>

35
00:01:53.411 --> 00:01:57.880
<v Speaker 2>have a peace dividend and he's talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>there to all the poor people in America,</v>

36
00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:01.450
<v Speaker 2>all the people with no decent roads and</v>
<v Speaker 2>schools and train systems and all the</v>

37
00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:05.140
<v Speaker 2>horrible way deteriorate it</v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure that the u s now is a</v>

38
00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:07.270
<v Speaker 2>victim of like a fourth world country.</v>

39
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.280
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

40
00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:12.580
<v Speaker 2>there's no peace dividend because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>old secretary of defense,</v>

41
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Darth Cheney writes up a big program for</v>

42
00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:20.500
<v Speaker 2>world conquest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so everybody's our enemy.</v>

43
00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Sadly then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's even better.</v>

44
00:02:21.881 --> 00:02:25.450
<v Speaker 2>We only had the Russians before and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly everybody is our enemy.</v>

45
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 2>And then it's got to find some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

46
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:31.540
<v Speaker 2>let attack Iraq little attacks here and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and we'll conquer from Iraq to</v>

47
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.110
<v Speaker 2>central Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

48
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:34.180
<v Speaker 2>and get all the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

49
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous thing he wrote in 1991</v>

50
00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:39.520
<v Speaker 2>which they'd been doing now in 2000 with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poor,</v>

51
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.670
<v Speaker 2>the poorest son who was just a party</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal who just,</v>

52
00:02:42.671 --> 00:02:44.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to sniff coke and have fun.</v>

53
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.100
<v Speaker 2>And they just put him up there and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like going like this and they don't</v>

54
00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:51.460
<v Speaker 2>here's know what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's leading the charge of these</v>

55
00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:56.170
<v Speaker 2>complete World War II lunatics who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminals really basically themselves,</v>

56
00:02:56.171 --> 00:02:57.070
<v Speaker 2>their war criminals.</v>

57
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.310
<v Speaker 2>But my point is that that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>incompetence of their way of going about</v>

58
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:08.311
<v Speaker 2>it shows how desperate they are because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the system that they sit astride of is</v>

59
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 2>no longer functional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

60
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.870
<v Speaker 2>It a hundred years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 years ago in the time of imperialism</v>

61
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.960
<v Speaker 2>cleansing and you could win a war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's defined by von Clausewitz</v>

62
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 2>wage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the war theorists as meaning you now</v>

63
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 2>don't just beat the enemy's army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You then make the enemies population do</v>

64
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 2>what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have a colonial empire and they</v>

65
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 2>produce goods for you and they do things</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you because then you can subdue</v>

66
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But nobody can seem to anybody now.</v>

67
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.390
<v Speaker 2>They just don't get subdued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even so much,</v>

68
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 2>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw that and be numb,</v>

69
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 2>but you guys wearing silk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black little pajamas running around in</v>

70
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 2>pajamas kicked us right out of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

71
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 2>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were falling off the side of</v>

72
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 2>ships in Da Nang harbor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>falling off helicopters and stuff.</v>

73
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Bunch of guys in pajamas.</v>
