1
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>As a cold sort of statute like figure as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person who,</v>

2
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was he seen almost,</v>

3
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 1>he's portrayed almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a sherlock holmes character,</v>

4
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.820
<v Speaker 1>sort of all intellect and primarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect and not a person of passion.</v>

5
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.640
<v Speaker 1>He was a deeply emotional person and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like lots of emotional people try to</v>

6
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:47.151
<v Speaker 1>hide that by appearing somewhat detached</v>
<v Speaker 1>and aloof.</v>

7
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.550
<v Speaker 1>So I think the notion of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a cold and cerebral Jefferson is,</v>

8
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a misconception.</v>

9
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was almost irrational in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

10
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in passions about politics,</v>

11
00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.030
<v Speaker 1>about people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of things.</v>

12
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.420
<v Speaker 1>So that would be it getting rid of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of Coal Jefferson,</v>

14
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.080
<v Speaker 1>there's this notion of him as someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's just sort of unfeeling,</v>

15
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>detached person and there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>

16
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a very much a man of sentiment and</v>

17
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>feeling and that I think comes through</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>

18
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his attitudes about,</v>

19
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.513
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>about wine and food and architecture and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those kinds of things,</v>

21
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.880
<v Speaker 1>but he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not all mind the head and heart.</v>

22
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.600
<v Speaker 1>The famous letter that he writes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maria,</v>

23
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Maria cosway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.390
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people assumed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

25
00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>the headwinds because that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jefferson is,</v>

26
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.370
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's true.</v>
