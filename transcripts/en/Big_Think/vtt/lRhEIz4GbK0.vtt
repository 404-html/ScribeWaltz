1
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.560
<v Speaker 1>When I feel depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

2
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.460
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel down,</v>

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I was learning about the causes of</v>

4
00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:14.101
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>

5
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:16.100
<v Speaker 1>if I bit lost connections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started to realize,</v>

6
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing.</v>

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor at Stanford called Robert</v>

8
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Sapolsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who in his early twenties went to live</v>

9
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:29.801
<v Speaker 1>with a troop of baboons in Kenya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was his job to figure out when</v>

10
00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>are baboons most stressed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his job was to hit them with little</v>

11
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:37.400
<v Speaker 1>tranquilizer darts and then take a blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>test and measure something called</v>

12
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Cortisol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a hormone that Bobbins and ours</v>

13
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 1>released when we're stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And baboons live in this hierarchy,</v>

14
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:47.990
<v Speaker 1>so the females don't interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the men live in a very strict</v>

15
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:49.460
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if there's 30 men,</v>

16
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.520
<v Speaker 1>number one notice above number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've been tuned noses above number</v>

17
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:54.800
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number 12 notices by number 13.</v>

18
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.350
<v Speaker 1>And that really determines a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tennessee you get to have sex with.</v>

19
00:00:57.351 --> 00:01:00.470
<v Speaker 1>It determines what you get to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It determines whether you get to sit in</v>

20
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:02.810
<v Speaker 1>the shade or pushed out into the heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

21
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really significant way you are in the,</v>

22
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.360
<v Speaker 1>in the hierarchy and what professors are</v>
<v Speaker 1>polsky found is I've been to,</v>

23
00:01:10.721 --> 00:01:15.721
<v Speaker 1>are most stressed in two situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is when their status is insecure.</v>

24
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.370
<v Speaker 1>So if you're the top guy and someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>circling,</v>

25
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.830
<v Speaker 1>which comes for Ya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.990
<v Speaker 1>you will be massively stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other situation is when you feel</v>

27
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:26.300
<v Speaker 1>you're at the bottom of a hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

28
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:27.230
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

29
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been kind of humiliated.</v>

30
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.570
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what professor Sir Pasky found,</v>

31
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.990
<v Speaker 1>which I think is really noticed and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was later developed by other</v>

32
00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>scientists is when you feel you've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed to the bottom,</v>

33
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you show something called</v>
<v Speaker 1>it submission gesture.</v>

34
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.340
<v Speaker 1>So you baboons will raise a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>

35
00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:47.810
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I seem assume by means of watching this,</v>

36
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:52.811
<v Speaker 1>maybe they are you a Babin will put its</v>
<v Speaker 1>body down physically or put its head</v>

37
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:55.370
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will put its bottom in the air and it</v>

38
00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:57.740
<v Speaker 1>will cover its head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's clearly seems to be</v>

39
00:01:57.741 --> 00:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>communicating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just leave me alone.</v>

40
00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:00.680
<v Speaker 1>You've beaten me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

41
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>you've beaten me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what lots of scientists or</v>

42
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:06.200
<v Speaker 1>subsequent about people like professor</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Gilbert in Britain and Professor</v>

43
00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Kate Pickett and professor Richard</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilkinson also in Britain,</v>

44
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.530
<v Speaker 1>have really developed as this idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually what human depression is in</v>

45
00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:13.610
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not entirely,</v>

46
00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:16.940
<v Speaker 1>but in part is a form of a submission</v>
<v Speaker 1>gesture.</v>

47
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a way of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't cope with this anymore.</v>

48
00:02:19.821 --> 00:02:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Particularly people who feel they've</v>

49
00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:24.080
<v Speaker 1>been pushed to the bottom of hierarchies</v>
<v Speaker 1>or he feel,</v>

50
00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:26.900
<v Speaker 1>remember the other stressful situations</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you feel your status is insecure,</v>

51
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.180
<v Speaker 1>it's a way of just going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

52
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.020
<v Speaker 1>I retreat.</v>

53
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't want this fight anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd beaten me.</v>

54
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a kind of very strong evolutionary</v>

55
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:37.910
<v Speaker 1>impulse where you feel you're under</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack to just submit in the hope that</v>

56
00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 1>the stress and anxiety will then go away</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the sources of the stress and</v>

57
00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:43.940
<v Speaker 1>anxiety will then go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one thing,</v>

58
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.420
<v Speaker 1>so pondering cable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider,</v>

59
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.970
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kate Pickett in Richard Wilkinson really</v>

60
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:50.750
<v Speaker 1>developed this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've shown so and I was,</v>

61
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.180
<v Speaker 1>an inequality grows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

62
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.300
<v Speaker 1>depression and anxiety grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've shown this very robust effect,</v>

63
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This helps us to explain it.</v>

64
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>If you live Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're status is relatively secure,</v>

65
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's that high.</v>

66
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>No one's that low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

67
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>movement between where you are is not so</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme.</v>

68
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>If you live in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially today,</v>

69
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>which is we're now at the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of inequality since the 1920s</v>

70
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 1>there's a few people at the very top.</v>

71
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.510
<v Speaker 1>There's a kind of precarious middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a huge and swelling bottom,</v>

72
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got,</v>

73
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>you can see why in the United States</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got more people who'd be showing</v>

74
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 1>a submission gesture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who'd be like,</v>

75
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.751
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

76
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been beaten than they would be in</v>

77
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Norway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why inequality is one of the</v>

78
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:38.671
<v Speaker 1>drivers of depression and anxiety and</v>
<v Speaker 1>why dealing with inequality reduces</v>

79
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>inequality and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that really</v>

80
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>shocked me actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was looking at,</v>

81
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the group with the lowest depression by</v>

82
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>far as the amish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went and spent time with an amish</v>

83
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Amish live in these homogenous</v>

84
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are incredibly equal.</v>

85
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 1>The richest amish is as worth as much as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poorest amish,</v>

86
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not showing sub submission</v>

87
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>gestures in the same way cause nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't fit.</v>

88
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot wrong with the amish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>

89
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm not suggesting mass conversion to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Amish.</v>

90
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm a gay man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe me,</v>

91
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

92
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can learn from the fact that in these</v>

93
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>highly equal and homogenous groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that,</v>

94
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>that extreme status stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

95
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go as far as the amish</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

96
00:04:15.661 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>but we moving closer to it would be one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the factors that would reduce</v>

97
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 1>depression and anxiety.</v>

98
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
