1
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Eye Witness testimony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.700
<v Speaker 1>of course is the single greatest cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the conviction of the innocent.</v>

3
00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:10.310
<v Speaker 1>And what's fascinating about that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have now,</v>

5
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years,</v>

6
00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:19.241
<v Speaker 1>more than 30 years of fantastic research</v>
<v Speaker 1>from experimental psychologists who</v>

7
00:00:20.781 --> 00:00:21.614
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recreated crime scene.</v>

9
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.860
<v Speaker 1>We recreated a events and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.190
<v Speaker 1>played around with which different way</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do a photo array or a lineup and</v>

11
00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:37.790
<v Speaker 1>different techniques that are used</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlate more with accurate and</v>

12
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:40.160
<v Speaker 1>reliable identifications in which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.050
<v Speaker 1>techniques lead to errors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

14
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a number of reforms have been,</v>

15
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

16
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.010
<v Speaker 2>adopted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

17
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.420
<v Speaker 2>by federal</v>

18
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.540
<v Speaker 1>commissions and the American Bar</v>
<v Speaker 1>Association,</v>

19
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>the International Association of Chiefs</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Police,</v>

20
00:00:55.591 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 1>lots of policing entities based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good scientific research.</v>

21
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this research,</v>

22
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>there's Meta analyses a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you pulled together lots of</v>

23
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>different studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.380
<v Speaker 1>and you have a lot of confidence that</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things,</v>

25
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are real effects.</v>

26
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:14.320
<v Speaker 1>And I'll give you some examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

27
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>that may surprise people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

28
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you show somebody a photo array</v>

29
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>or a live lineup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he should tell the witness.</v>

30
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're now going to show you some</v>

31
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>pictures or people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please keep in mind that the real</v>

33
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>perpetrator may or may not be in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>photo array or a lineup.</v>

34
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't make an identification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry,</v>

35
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>the investigation will continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just giving that morning,</v>

36
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatically reduces incorrect</v>

37
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:49.830
<v Speaker 1>identifications without really reducing</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct identifications.</v>

38
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's of extraordinary importance</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously in terms of being able to go</v>

39
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:56.070
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find the real perpetrator and not arrest</v>

40
00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>the wrong person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

41
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of reasons we think that</v>

42
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>this warning will reduce era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

43
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>certainly it inhibits people from</v>
<v Speaker 1>guessing and,</v>

44
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.170
<v Speaker 1>there's kind of a natural inclination to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

46
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another reform that's of really critical</v>

47
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>importance is that the person that</v>
<v Speaker 1>administers the lineup of the photo</v>

48
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>array should be double blinded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to say that the person should</v>

49
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:25.510
<v Speaker 1>not know who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>the suspect is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's important for many reasons,</v>

52
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.090
<v Speaker 1>not the least of which is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility</v>

53
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.600
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

54
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.040
<v Speaker 2>feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

55
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.370
<v Speaker 1>confirming feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What again,</v>

56
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Meta analyses have shown is that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>say to somebody off you picked that</v>

57
00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:53.180
<v Speaker 1>number too good or it gives some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>confirming feedback,</v>

58
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.520
<v Speaker 1>whether a law enforcement person or</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else.</v>

59
00:02:55.521 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what this does is it can falsely inflate</v>

60
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>at the person's certainty that they made</v>
<v Speaker 1>the correct identification,</v>

61
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>the witnesses belief that they had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good opportunity to observe the</v>

62
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 1>witnesses belief that they were paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention when the crime was committed.</v>

63
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these factors,</v>

64
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainty,</v>

65
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.240
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to observe paying attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>are all factors that the courts used to</v>

66
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:30.300
<v Speaker 1>be using or use frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying to weigh the reliability of</v>

67
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>identification when we know that let's</v>
<v Speaker 1>say some suggestive procedure has been</v>

68
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So positive,</v>

69
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confirming feedback or even just the use</v>

70
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 1>of an unduly suggestive procedure can</v>
<v Speaker 1>falsely inflate these so called</v>

71
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:45.650
<v Speaker 1>reliability factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:46.721
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainty,</v>

73
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to observe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention paid.</v>

74
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.931
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

75
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:54.931
<v Speaker 1>the legal tests are out of whack with</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the scientific evidence shows</v>

76
00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>more than a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

77
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.240
<v Speaker 1>the National Academy of Sciences came</v>
<v Speaker 1>out with a report about forensic</v>

78
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally extremely important report,</v>

79
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>a landmark report that anybody really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in this field should look at.</v>

80
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this report,</v>

81
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically said,</v>

82
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>DNA testing is the only validated a</v>

83
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:21.350
<v Speaker 1>forensic discipline we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

84
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>and in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at pattern evidence,</v>

85
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>and by this they were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>fingerprints and tire tracks and looking</v>

86
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 1>at the striations on bullets and trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to determine just it gives me whether</v>

87
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:35.740
<v Speaker 1>they came from a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular gun or not.</v>

88
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these,</v>

89
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern disciplines had not been</v>

90
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.710
<v Speaker 1>adequately validated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

91
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.220
<v Speaker 1>because she would have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

92
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.000
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 1>an experts coming into court and they'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

94
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at the striations of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullet that we recovered from the crime</v>

95
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>

96
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 1>And now I found this defendant's gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I fired a bullet from that.</v>

97
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 1>And I'm looking at the two of them under</v>
<v Speaker 1>a microscope,</v>

98
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>and I see all these lines and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's quote unquote sufficient</v>

99
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:00.640
<v Speaker 1>agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by that.</v>

100
00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 1>And if I'm really a big quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>assurance lab,</v>

101
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll bring my buddy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he'll look at the microscope and</v>

102
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 1>he'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's also agreement here.</v>

103
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.710
<v Speaker 1>And from this I can now tell you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this bullet came from that gun to the</v>

104
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:14.020
<v Speaker 1>exclusion of all other guns in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

105
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it scientifically.</v>

106
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:21.160
<v Speaker 1>On what basis do you have a database?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you tell us anything about the</v>

107
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 1>frequency of firing similar patterns if</v>
<v Speaker 1>indeed you have similar patterns?</v>

108
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Do you have measurement area here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you give us a number?</v>

109
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with DNA testing we can give you a</v>

110
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:33.520
<v Speaker 1>number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can give you the frequency of a</v>

111
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Speaker 1>particular DNA profile and the various</v>
<v Speaker 1>different populations.</v>

112
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Can you give us a statistic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

113
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.920
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't giving statistics.</v>

114
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:43.840
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were just saying it's unique.</v>

115
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>This bullet comes from that gun to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>exclusion of all guns in the universe.</v>

116
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 1>This is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the National Academy of Science said</v>

117
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:53.290
<v Speaker 1>so and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are really got to go back to</v>

118
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 1>the drawing board and do some basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

119
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find out what the answers are to that</v>

120
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even fingerprints,</v>

121
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we know I,</v>

122
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.520
<v Speaker 1>if you take all 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.980
<v Speaker 1>prints and you scan it in and you put it</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a data,</v>

124
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 1>the database of known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

125
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>fingerprints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do a pretty good job of</v>

126
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:16.880
<v Speaker 1>identifying somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the question.</v>

127
00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 1>When you're talking about a small latent</v>
<v Speaker 1>print that a crime scene,</v>

128
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>you get a partial thumbprint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

129
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 1>and every time you lay down a print,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always a little bit uneven and then</v>

130
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>you compare it to somebody else's thumb</v>
<v Speaker 1>print.</v>

131
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Can you say that this small latent</v>
<v Speaker 1>uniquely comes from that individual?</v>

132
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

133
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.480
<v Speaker 1>that is the way the testimony was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>in for years.</v>

134
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 1>And it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

135
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that scientific basis to say that it</v>

136
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 1>uniquely was this person's print.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say that.</v>
