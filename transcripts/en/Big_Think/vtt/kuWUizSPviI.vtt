1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Religion is increasingly suppressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>among educated people.</v>

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:06.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not suppressed politically or</v>
<v Speaker 1>legally,</v>

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my students say,</v>

4
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll as I students in colleges across</v>

5
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>have no concept of what the Bible is or</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's in it.</v>

7
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Think of it as a toxic book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know nothing about Christianity,</v>

8
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 1>less about Judaism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>so at the same time when the threats to</v>
<v Speaker 1>human dignity,</v>

10
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.530
<v Speaker 1>dignity and integrity are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>ramped up to extraordinary levels of</v>

11
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:35.601
<v Speaker 1>stress where we most need wisdom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral seriousness.</v>

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing wisdom and moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriousness come under attack.</v>

13
00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>And often from the same people who want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do the genetic engineering is</v>

14
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>crusading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crusading.</v>

15
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Atheism is sort of a clause today is</v>
<v Speaker 1>popular.</v>

16
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say among scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean as to do general.</v>

17
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>It isn't so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are certainly a prominent</v>

18
00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:01.770
<v Speaker 1>people in the scientific community are</v>
<v Speaker 1>prominent people who were religious Jews</v>

19
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 1>or Christians in the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

20
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.830
<v Speaker 1>But there are also prominent people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>who have taken their atheism to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>public successfully,</v>

22
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 1>who are crusading atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who preach atheism,</v>

23
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.230
<v Speaker 1>atheism in an aggressive way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of the science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they play on people's weakness in</v>

25
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far as most people don't take the</v>

26
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>trouble to learn science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy for a scientist to saying,</v>

27
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm smarter than you are because I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and you don't know.</v>

28
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I understand the genome and you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand the physics.</v>

29
00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:32.440
<v Speaker 1>I can do hard calculus problems and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just twelfth grade level one.</v>

30
00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>So you can see how much smarter I am</v>
<v Speaker 1>than than,</v>

31
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.090
<v Speaker 1>than you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I tell you there,</v>

32
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>there are no moral absolutes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion is trash.</v>

33
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>And furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ought to go ahead with human cloning.</v>

34
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>We should go ahead with genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering and implantables sorts,</v>

35
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.530
<v Speaker 1>which will smudge line between human and</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>

36
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>We're getting into a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a moral conflict of interest,</v>

37
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>which is tremendously dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

38
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we will succumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

39
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:00.060
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 1>human beings have faced hard challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Second World War was,</v>

41
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:10.040
<v Speaker 1>is difficult to crisis as mankind ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>will face a,</v>

42
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm 50 million people died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a humanity.</v>

43
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Teetered on the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a state.</v>

44
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Paganism was preached aggressively by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler.</v>

45
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which despised Christianity as much as I</v>

46
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.040
<v Speaker 1>hated Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't hate Christians as people,</v>

47
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 1>but it hated Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

48
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese empire,</v>

49
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:35.811
<v Speaker 1>which was a w which revived stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>paganism in preference to the more</v>

50
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:40.620
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated religion of Buddhism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity that had been popular in</v>

51
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stalinist Russia,</v>

52
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>which was an aggressively pagan nations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suppressed Christianity.</v>

53
00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:49.170
<v Speaker 1>That was a crisis of enormous crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We rose to the occasion.</v>

54
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.230
<v Speaker 1>We defeated it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It damaged us.</v>

55
00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:54.380
<v Speaker 1>We still bear the scars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

56
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.150
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to face a crisis in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coming century.</v>

57
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.830
<v Speaker 1>It will be different in character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never the same.</v>

58
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>We never see the same crisis twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

59
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we have the moral,</v>

60
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>a strength to rise to the occasion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I hope and pray that we do in</v>

61
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>
