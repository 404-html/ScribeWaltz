00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Physics is about discovering with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>laws of nature are,</v>

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.180
<v Speaker 1>and we've gotten some distance towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>We're not done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've gotten some good distance</v>

4
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:11.140
<v Speaker 1>towards that at the present time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you know it,</v>

5
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>the laws of nature are another kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>question unfolds itself,</v>

6
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 1>which is why are those the laws and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>other laws.</v>

7
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the laws that we understand,</v>

8
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Speaker 1>the standard model of particle physics</v>
<v Speaker 1>describes all the fundamental particles.</v>

9
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>They're interactions has about 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers,</v>

10
00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:30.300
<v Speaker 1>which you just have to put in as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>result of measuring them by experiment,</v>

11
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>the masses of a different particles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quarks,</v>

12
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>electrons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neutrinos the strengths of the</v>

13
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Speaker 1>fundamental forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>various numbers like that.</v>

14
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 1>And the model works dramatically well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the recent experiments at the large</v>

15
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Hadron collider show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are those numbers,</v>

16
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:49.470
<v Speaker 1>what they are and our universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is a massive the electron,</v>

17
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>what it is and not 12 times larger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half the size.</v>

18
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 1>There are dozens of questions like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I developed cosmological natural</v>

19
00:00:57.451 --> 00:01:02.451
<v Speaker 1>selection to try to give an evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>account of this so that there would be a</v>

20
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 1>history back before the big bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we see these numbers could change</v>

21
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:11.031
<v Speaker 1>and evolve through a series of events</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Big Bang and there could be an</v>

22
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:16.491
<v Speaker 1>explanation akin to natural selection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like you want to know why do people</v>

23
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:21.690
<v Speaker 1>have two legs and not three legs or five</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs or four legs or six legs.</v>

24
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 1>There's an evolutionary reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A certain kind of fitness has been</v>

25
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.200
<v Speaker 1>improved over many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many generations and similarly that</v>

26
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>could be a notion of fitness of the laws</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nature should approve or many</v>

27
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>generations and cosmological natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>selection was an example of the theory</v>

28
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.550
<v Speaker 1>of that kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized that the only methodology we</v>

29
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:47.850
<v Speaker 1>hadn't science or the best methodology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had science for explaining how</v>

30
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.800
<v Speaker 1>choices having made the system true lead</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a lot of structure because one of the</v>

31
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>mysteries is why our universe is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>structured as it is on so many scales</v>

32
00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:59.730
<v Speaker 1>from organic molecules.</v>

33
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Bio Molecules are too vast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arrays of clusters of galaxies.</v>

34
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>This enormous structure on such a wide</v>
<v Speaker 1>range of scales and that turns out to be</v>

35
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:13.251
<v Speaker 1>tied to the values of these constants of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Standard Model of particle physics.</v>

36
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 1>And so why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I realized that the only methodology</v>

37
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>that was really successful for</v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining how choice were made in</v>

38
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 1>nature such as to lead to an improbable</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of structure is natural</v>

39
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>selection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for natural selection,</v>

40
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Speaker 1>we need reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a hypothesis lying around</v>

41
00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 1>that universities reproduced through</v>
<v Speaker 1>black holes inside black holes,</v>

42
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>rather than there being singularities</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're time ends.</v>

43
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>There were the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically the bursts of new regions of</v>

44
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:44.000
<v Speaker 1>space and time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could become new universes.</v>

45
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>And I took over that hypothesis and took</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the hypothesis that maybe the laws</v>

46
00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>of nature changed slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has been made by Johnny Wheeler in</v>

47
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:57.441
<v Speaker 1>the 1960s and just added a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that those changes should be</v>

48
00:02:58.381 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>very small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there can be accumulation of</v>

49
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:05.731
<v Speaker 1>fitness leads to a prediction or an</v>
<v Speaker 1>observation that archer,</v>

50
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many generations,</v>

51
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>the population of universities should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine tuned to maximize the production of</v>

52
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>black holes.</v>

53
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>And that has further implications for</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we can actually try to</v>

54
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:22.651
<v Speaker 1>measure and disprove experimentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's very briefly the idea of</v>

55
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>cosmological natural selection.</v>

56
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
