00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>The question of leadership is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because,</v>

2
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for most businesses really at this</v>

4
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the loss of control they fear is already</v>

5
00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 1>in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6
00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:19.950
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was,</v>

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.980
<v Speaker 1>there was a media environment in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost any message about ibm that was in</v>

8
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:31.311
<v Speaker 1>the public was created by IBM and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>circulated via press release or reported</v>

9
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:34.550
<v Speaker 1>by a newspaper or what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.660
<v Speaker 1>and then of course there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>word of mouth chatter on the street</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of stuff,</v>

12
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>but that all operated at a level so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller than anything a large company</v>

13
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:46.890
<v Speaker 1>can produce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.580
<v Speaker 1>the biggest change in leadership I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that those days are over.</v>

15
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the range of choices leaders</v>

16
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:03.921
<v Speaker 1>have about the perception of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>company a has been quite,</v>

17
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>quite restricted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.370
<v Speaker 1>because the counter story will always</v>
<v Speaker 1>get at as well.</v>

19
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just much more of a dialogue in the</v>

20
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

21
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.700
<v Speaker 1>so the two great visions of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of leadership we have,</v>

22
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grand visionary or the micromanager,</v>

23
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now seem to meet not to work as well.</v>

24
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

25
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet is kind of compressed,</v>

26
00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:33.771
<v Speaker 1>the range and leadership has become</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead a combination of a,</v>

27
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 1>infusing a company with whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 1>core,</v>

28
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.760
<v Speaker 1>the core imperatives are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and making sure that the company doesn't</v>

29
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:49.530
<v Speaker 1>overbalance too far in one direction or</v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

30
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>So Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take just one example,</v>

31
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Amazon has my favorite corporate award</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever in the history of corporate awards.</v>

32
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.110
<v Speaker 1>They have an award that you can only win</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an employee if you do something great</v>

33
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:03.920
<v Speaker 1>and you didn't ask permission first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

34
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get if you ask permission,</v>

35
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 1>if you clear things with your bosses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you do something really good and</v>

36
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>you just saw that it was a possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you did it,</v>

37
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>you've got a special word for not having</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked permission.</v>

38
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's an example of something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your friend,</v>

39
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>your earlier point about your friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>lowers the amount of internal</v>

40
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:25.341
<v Speaker 1>communication required and also sets a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural norm for the business that no</v>

41
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:29.390
<v Speaker 1>amount of memos and mission statements</v>
<v Speaker 1>could Sibley send.</v>

42
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>And that kind of leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

43
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

44
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.640
<v Speaker 1>what visa does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in terms of creating a cultural</v>

45
00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:40.641
<v Speaker 1>climate where good ideas are rewarded</v>
<v Speaker 1>matters so much more than,</v>

46
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either grand visioning or a micromanager</v>

47
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this environment.</v>
