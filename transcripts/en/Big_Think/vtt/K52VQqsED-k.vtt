00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Just make sure on global climate that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about more than climate</v>

2
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 1>and that you understand what climate</v>
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>

3
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>There's a great argument that global</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change,</v>

4
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>which has become warmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has actually been a real positive.</v>

5
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:23.840
<v Speaker 1>We have less people freezing to death</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though we have some that are dying</v>

6
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>and is that where the highest priority</v>
<v Speaker 1>for our resources is red or is it fight</v>

7
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>email?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mail nutrition,</v>

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>malnutrition around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if fighting malaria around the</v>

9
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:37.560
<v Speaker 1>world are HIV aids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you gave me $200,000,000,000 to go</v>

10
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>spend over the next 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>global climate will be the last place</v>

11
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:44.330
<v Speaker 1>I'd put that money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be in the malnutrition.</v>

12
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.550
<v Speaker 1>It would be in a malaria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be an HIV aids.</v>

13
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>That's what we need to decide as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

14
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like giving a new heart to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 90 year old.</v>

15
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Do you give that new heart to a 10 year</v>
<v Speaker 1>old or do you give it to 90 year old?</v>

16
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 1>You've got to make choices because there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are limited resources at the end of the</v>

17
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>day and if I'm going to end up being</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxed for $100,000,000,000 worth of cost</v>

18
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>is a consuming nation of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make sure those taxes go to</v>

19
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>the best places we can for the world's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth and health,</v>

20
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>health and welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I vote for doing that on the side of</v>

21
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 1>hunger and disease way before I try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create,</v>

22
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 1>try to fight the fiction that I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been hoisted on us about what CEO is</v>

23
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>really doing and we have to absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>educate ourselves just as I'm doing</v>

24
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>right now about what is really causing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>

25
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Is it actually he the warmth the globe</v>
<v Speaker 1>causing ceo to to rise or is it CO2</v>

26
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>causing the the heat of the globe to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and importantly,</v>

27
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Speaker 1>if it is going up because of manmade</v>
<v Speaker 1>emissions,</v>

28
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:45.330
<v Speaker 1>is it all bad or is it actually arguably</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat good?</v>

29
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Is the Arctic actually melting because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the wind changes or because of co?</v>

30
00:01:49.991 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Two is the Antarctic actually losing</v>
<v Speaker 1>five percent of its ice in one part and</v>

31
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:58.530
<v Speaker 1>growing out of 95 percent more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure we get all the points of the</v>

32
00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>story and that we don't have special</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest groups lobbying groups,</v>

33
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the oil industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the environmental movement</v>

34
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.170
<v Speaker 1>or whether it's politicians or other</v>
<v Speaker 1>ngos telling us how the world ought to</v>

35
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get educated all of us on her own</v>

36
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 1>and get past the rhetoric and actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>make tough,</v>

37
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>tough economic choices based on where</v>
<v Speaker 1>our hurt says the world ought to go.</v>
