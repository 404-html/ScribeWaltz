1
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 2>are you talking about it is informed</v>
<v Speaker 2>risk taking an informed risk taking in</v>

3
00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:22.540
<v Speaker 2>that culture is fundamental towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>supporting innovation.</v>

4
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got to be an educated</v>

5
00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:26.340
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.410
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're working on something that you</v>

7
00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:34.411
<v Speaker 2>don't quite understand the probability</v>
<v Speaker 2>of making it better by messing with it,</v>

8
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.850
<v Speaker 2>just reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if just think about those two tenants</v>

9
00:00:39.851 --> 00:00:42.010
<v Speaker 2>for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a culture that supports it,</v>

10
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.650
<v Speaker 2>and then number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

11
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

12
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 2>enough education and knowledge and</v>
<v Speaker 2>teamwork to be able to go to go build</v>

13
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:52.180
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are very few individuals</v>

14
00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:55.660
<v Speaker 2>anymore they can understand one of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>products and some of them have over a</v>

15
00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:58.120
<v Speaker 2>billion transistors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to know what each one of them</v>

16
00:00:58.121 --> 00:00:59.320
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

17
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.850
<v Speaker 2>So there are teams of people that create</v>
<v Speaker 2>these and they're bigger teams of people</v>

18
00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:06.550
<v Speaker 2>that try to validate them and distribute</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

19
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.423
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

20
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.330
<v Speaker 2>So if I was thinking about a third</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

21
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.030
<v Speaker 2>it would be about building that culture</v>
<v Speaker 2>of teamwork and allowing teams then</v>

22
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 2>being innovative</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the Intel fellow level,</v>

23
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 2>the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the very top approximately hundred</v>

24
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.330
<v Speaker 2>scientists and technologists that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

25
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.650
<v Speaker 2>we tell them they can have half the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>to themselves and they can go work in</v>

26
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:32.390
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very few of them actually take us up on</v>

27
00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:36.800
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the offer is genuine now it means in</v>

28
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:39.020
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some area that they have some</v>

29
00:01:39.021 --> 00:01:40.160
<v Speaker 2>expertise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

30
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we actually haven't really faced a lot</v>

31
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:50.081
<v Speaker 2>of that difficulty because because our</v>
<v Speaker 2>products are so incredibly complex,</v>

32
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 2>beautifully complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one could argue and because there's so</v>

33
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:59.180
<v Speaker 2>much change that goes on all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're interested in the field of</v>

34
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:02.690
<v Speaker 2>computing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working for Intel is just our great</v>

35
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:03.710
<v Speaker 2>place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

36
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.880
<v Speaker 2>And they have a tendency to work in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to work in work in that area.</v>

37
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Now we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we try to go off and then there was a</v>

38
00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:17.261
<v Speaker 2>pretty formal process for determining in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the R and d labs what technology's still</v>

39
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:24.560
<v Speaker 2>hold promise and when to kind of reduce</v>
<v Speaker 2>the funding in an area.</v>

40
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.120
<v Speaker 2>And when and when to move it forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have a lot of process until it's a</v>

41
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.770
<v Speaker 2>process driven company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a lot of processes that do that,</v>

42
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.040
<v Speaker 2>but fundamentally the idea is that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can do most of the development in the</v>

43
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:40.160
<v Speaker 2>area of expertise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some form of computing.</v>

44
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.500
<v Speaker 2>And then in the research labs</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

45
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.250
<v Speaker 2>a very organized process to determine</v>
<v Speaker 2>which ones we continue to find out which</v>

46
00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:47.500
<v Speaker 2>ones we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

47
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we pass on.</v>

48
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the culture.</v>

49
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.110
<v Speaker 2>The first one I answered the tenants of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the culture would be first you have to</v>

50
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 2>respect that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that means doesn't always work.</v>

51
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 2>The second one is education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talked about that.</v>

52
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.700
<v Speaker 2>See if there's a third one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

53
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the third one is really you have</v>

54
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 2>to just feel inwardly wonderful about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the success.</v>

55
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 2>So if you step back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

56
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then people are educated,</v>

57
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 2>then do you really celebrate those</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that can move it forward.</v>

58
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes a team moves it forward</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then sometimes you know,</v>

59
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.210
<v Speaker 2>just one person makes a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we give away the intel achievement</v>

60
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:37.140
<v Speaker 2>awards every year and lots of times</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are teams of people where,</v>

61
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our team has done something really</v>

62
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 2>innovative and you have a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

63
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 2>but we give them a great party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

64
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 2>that every once in a while it was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>one individual who stands up and it's so</v>

65
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:54.091
<v Speaker 2>clear at the corporate level that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>one person moved intel and those are</v>

66
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:55.534
<v Speaker 2>really special.</v>

67
00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.010
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

68
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 2>we do throw the party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that much of it.</v>

69
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's step back and say what innovation</v>

70
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 2>really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Innovation is the ability to build a new</v>

71
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 2>product or new service in some way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that betters the product line or</v>

72
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.660
<v Speaker 2>hopefully is solving a customer need</v>
<v Speaker 2>better than before.</v>

73
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.260
<v Speaker 2>So we reward that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

74
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be careful what you ask for.</v>

75
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good design engineers have a</v>

76
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:28.270
<v Speaker 2>tendency to then become group leads and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can certainly move up that</v>

77
00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 2>engineering chain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We allow,</v>

78
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 2>we allow scientists and engineers to</v>
<v Speaker 2>either move up into a management change</v>

79
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.420
<v Speaker 2>or stay on their technical leadership</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards an Intel fellow.</v>

80
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 2>And an Intel fellow board until senior</v>
<v Speaker 2>fellow is the same,</v>

81
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>range in the company,</v>

82
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 2>same grade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same salary if not more than vice</v>

83
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 2>presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is,</v>

84
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

85
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 2>we kind of put our money where I'm out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and we recruit,</v>

86
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.160
<v Speaker 2>retain and we award those people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>can move this technology forward in,</v>

87
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a meaningful way.</v>

88
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 2>And then the second thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I keep trying to say what really</v>

89
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:10.440
<v Speaker 2>makes it work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got people around you that shared</v>

90
00:05:10.441 --> 00:05:12.400
<v Speaker 2>this culture that want to be doing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

91
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.830
<v Speaker 2>that when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you call them up at at night and</v>

92
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:15.341
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

93
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:17.080
<v Speaker 2>I know it's after work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just got to talk to you about</v>

94
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so excited and they don't hang up on</v>

95
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:23.320
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's that combination of</v>

96
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 2>respecting the individual and in dealing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all the management structures and</v>

97
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:30.490
<v Speaker 2>changes and challenges that result by</v>
<v Speaker 2>then second of all,</v>

98
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 2>having a culture and being able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>recruit other people into the</v>

99
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:35.780
<v Speaker 2>organization that share that common goal</v>
<v Speaker 2>set.</v>

100
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of people that would say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have lost some of that edge and</v>

101
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:47.671
<v Speaker 2>some would argue with that vehemently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me just point out the data,</v>

102
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The data are that,</v>

103
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 2>that we're no longer producing the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineers.</v>

104
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:57.170
<v Speaker 2>We are no longer producing the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of,</v>

105
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.333
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

106
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most amount of,</v>

107
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.641
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

108
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:02.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

109
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.620
<v Speaker 2>of new new companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have been the technological lead in</v>

110
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really had technical supremacy for</v>

111
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:17.951
<v Speaker 2>decades and are higher our lead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our higher education institutions still</v>

112
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 2>have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the best higher education system</v>

113
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.600
<v Speaker 2>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we really want to remain a</v>

114
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 2>technological powerhouse in the next 30</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

115
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 2>we need to start internalizing though</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those scores that are coming out to</v>

116
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 2>explain that we're in the twenties in</v>
<v Speaker 2>math and science.</v>

117
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Our children are not as well educated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the same work ethic</v>

118
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.630
<v Speaker 2>whether we like it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the test indicate.</v>

119
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 2>And I think we have to look at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>systemic issues that are causing that</v>

120
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.933
<v Speaker 2>and go after it.</v>

121
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Enjoying them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

122
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.670
<v Speaker 2>if you step back and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

123
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.940
<v Speaker 2>there's a creative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will always give you the,</v>

124
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.190
<v Speaker 2>you will spend most of your time on</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative people and,</v>

125
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 2>and that means that they will be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that you,</v>

126
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.790
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

127
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.360
<v Speaker 2>you want to most embraced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you're just most want to argue</v>

128
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 2>with the others because it depends on</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're going at any given at any</v>

129
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:21.440
<v Speaker 2>given moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most will usually have to enjoy and</v>

130
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.260
<v Speaker 2>respect their creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

131
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 2>if creative people believe they are</v>
<v Speaker 2>liked and respected,</v>

132
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.860
<v Speaker 2>then they will continue to be more and</v>
<v Speaker 2>more creative.</v>

133
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.880
<v Speaker 2>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily relate creativity</v>

134
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with lack of discipline.</v>

135
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.180
<v Speaker 2>You can be very creative within a</v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline.</v>

136
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Speaker 2>So if we're talking about how do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with undisciplined creative people</v>

137
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 2>than I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I think that's just a matter of</v>

138
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 2>trying to establish a common goal.</v>
