1
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.140
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely a trend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I had not a word I love to use,</v>

2
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a move,</v>

3
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:10.680
<v Speaker 1>let's say towards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are thoughtful about their</v>

5
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>space and their interiors are now even</v>
<v Speaker 1>being thoughtful about,</v>

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the,</v>

7
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of,</v>

8
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've sort of,</v>

9
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 1>chemicals are putting into their space</v>
<v Speaker 1>or amount of,</v>

11
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the,</v>

12
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.440
<v Speaker 1>the surfaces and what they're made out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of and off gassing.</v>

13
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.590
<v Speaker 1>volatile organic compounds is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are thinking about.</v>

15
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so when,</v>

16
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:39.330
<v Speaker 1>when someone says something's low voc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>

17
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 1>that's what voc means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

18
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally when we think of,</v>

19
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentally friendly interiors,</v>

21
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm used to seeing are these very</v>

22
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Speaker 1>kind of like a very sparse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very kind of clean,</v>

23
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call them,</v>

25
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hemp world kind of interiors and,</v>

26
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>and they're cool and I actually love the</v>
<v Speaker 1>look of that very minimal.</v>

27
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.110
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing with the client that a,</v>

28
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.890
<v Speaker 1>I designed this apartment for in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in River House,</v>

29
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that,</v>

30
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentally friendly interiors don't</v>

31
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:19.290
<v Speaker 1>have to necessarily be anesthetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to be your aesthetic.</v>

32
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>And even going back to what I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about before,</v>

33
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:22.840
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.320
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

35
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>I try to design spaces that are very</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal.</v>

36
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.110
<v Speaker 1>So the idea was that I wanted to do an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interior designing interior that was</v>

37
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.610
<v Speaker 1>filled with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personality of,</v>

38
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.590
<v Speaker 1>of the project for the client and tells</v>
<v Speaker 1>her story,</v>

39
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>but does it in an environmentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly way.</v>

40
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the photograph you're looking at right</v>

41
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.160
<v Speaker 1>of this living room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 1>this is the living room at river house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all every single piece of</v>

44
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>furniture from the curtain hardware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recycled metal.</v>

45
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>The dining table was recycled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zinc and paperstone top,</v>

46
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chairs were in.</v>

47
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.660
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.780
<v Speaker 1>they were made from all the furniture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coffee tables that are all made from</v>

49
00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>certified woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

50
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:12.170
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

52
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>with low voc finishes on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

53
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:20.991
<v Speaker 1>the rug was made from a vintage claims</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were tattered and worn that we cut</v>

54
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>up and then we connected them locally</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a organic,</v>

55
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt and then put them on organic pads</v>

56
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:31.800
<v Speaker 1>and the finishes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the or the glues for the wall covering</v>

57
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:34.650
<v Speaker 1>were low voc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wallpaper's themselves or</v>

58
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>sustainable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just the fills for the furniture</v>

59
00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:39.750
<v Speaker 1>are organic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

60
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:40.411
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>at every level we basically measured how</v>
<v Speaker 1>green,</v>

62
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always talk about it being shades of</v>

63
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>green and we took and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

64
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.500
<v Speaker 1>how can this piece be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some things are more green than others.</v>

65
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

66
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:59.031
<v Speaker 1>the lamps that flank the sofa are made</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a vintage wine bottles that are</v>

67
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>sitting on certified a walnut plants</v>
<v Speaker 1>with handmade twine,</v>

68
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>natural twine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lampshades locally made,</v>

70
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

71
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>the light fixture over the dining table</v>
<v Speaker 1>is made from recycled jet engine parts.</v>

72
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>The light next to the dining table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a pair of floor lamps that are</v>

73
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:23.041
<v Speaker 1>made from a recycled plumbing parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an element at,</v>

74
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:28.381
<v Speaker 1>at almost each piece has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real sort of lineage.</v>

75
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.191
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 1>that that connects it to being</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentally friendly.</v>

77
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>But overall I think when you walk into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the space,</v>

78
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't look at this and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

79
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>this is definitely ecofriendly interior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just feels like,</v>

80
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I think an interesting space that's kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fun.</v>

81
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 1>It's sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels fresh,</v>

82
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.890
<v Speaker 1>it feels stylish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it employs taste to a</v>

83
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 1>certain level and I guess that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective,</v>

84
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:57.440
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:03:57.441 --> 00:03:58.274
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

86
00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

87
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.071
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:01.790
<v Speaker 1>all of the elements that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.890
<v Speaker 1>sort of a defined what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

90
00:04:03.891 --> 00:04:07.850
<v Speaker 1>what is tasteful or pleasing to the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it employs a,</v>

91
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

92
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 1>those elements.</v>

93
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.700
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a very well rounded space</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think when you look at it,</v>

95
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.760
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

97
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.450
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it evokes emotions that I hope are</v>

98
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>positive and I talk about it in my book</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

99
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:24.220
<v Speaker 1>about the things that I look for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

100
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I put that are sort of incorporate</v>

101
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 1>into all of my designs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them to be fresh.</v>

102
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I want them to be inviting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them to be unpretentious.</v>

103
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I want them to be stylish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

104
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 1>I want them to be sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them to be inviting.</v>

105
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're at every,</v>

107
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every interior and some,</v>

108
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 1>some depending on the spaces or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>client or the situation are more fun</v>

109
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:52.470
<v Speaker 1>than sexy or more comfortable or less</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable or less inviting,</v>

110
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>more inviting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have to be there at some level</v>

111
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:55.430
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

112
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 1>and represent and be part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>collective.</v>

113
00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 1>that ultimately that balance and how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance that,</v>

115
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.710
<v Speaker 1>those emotions are really what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of defines how people</v>

116
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 1>emotionally connect with a space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that is what that emotional</v>

117
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.650
<v Speaker 1>connection is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What people are.</v>

118
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.400
<v Speaker 1>You use the term taste in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

119
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.050
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

120
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.150

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite interiors in New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

123
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.080
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

124
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>the four seasons restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it because I think it,</v>

125
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.851

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:46.720
<v Speaker 1>the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not the week it was timed,</v>

131
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on interior.</v>

132
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

133
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:51.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

134
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:55.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was cool from the beginning.</v>

135
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 1>It's been cool ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never,</v>

136
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.530
<v Speaker 1>it's just always been an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fabulous space and design and when I'm</v>

137
00:06:03.731 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm in there I feel,</v>

138
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my emotional reaction to it as like,</v>

139
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really awesome.</v>

140
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>So I think in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York that's one of my favorite,</v>

141
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interiors I would say my other favorite</v>

142
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:21.170
<v Speaker 1>interior in New York as my apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to really like your</v>

143
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:22.004
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

144
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to really be</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable in your space.</v>

145
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 1>You should really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they should always be kind of</v>

146
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:27.660
<v Speaker 1>challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 1>and adding and it should always</v>
<v Speaker 1>organically be evolving.</v>

148
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do like my space.</v>

149
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think you always,</v>

150
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could fall in love with so many</v>

151
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 1>interiors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

152
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of times it's not even just</v>

153
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole space,</v>

154
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>it's just you can fall in love with</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces in and think that's a really</v>

155
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>interesting concept or idea and sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>put that in your,</v>

156
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like your,</v>

157
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your file cabinet of good ideas.</v>

158
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say God through the world,</v>

159
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the US,</v>

160
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:04.650
<v Speaker 1>there's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

161
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.170
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

162
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York City is such an international</v>

163
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:11.650
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

164
00:07:11.651 --> 00:07:12.940
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much.</v>

165
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many influences,</v>

166
00:07:14.741 --> 00:07:16.450
<v Speaker 1>which I think is really fabulous.</v>

167
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.380
<v Speaker 1>I would say as a city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Chicago because I think it's an</v>

168
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.050
<v Speaker 1>amazing American city and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>architecture is really incredible.</v>

169
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a great representation of,</v>

170
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say when people come to us and</v>

171
00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:29.561
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

172
00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:31.410
<v Speaker 1>I love New York first time here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

173
00:07:31.411 --> 00:07:32.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.280
<v Speaker 1>this is like an international city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago is a true example of an American</v>

175
00:07:37.921 --> 00:07:38.500
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

176
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.220
<v Speaker 1>or the best example of an American city</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Philip Johnson's glass house I</v>

177
00:07:42.221 --> 00:07:43.990
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to say on the property,</v>

178
00:07:43.991 --> 00:07:47.200
<v Speaker 1>I also love the old farm house on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same property.</v>

179
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.130
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a difficult question for me.</v>

180
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

181
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.980
<v Speaker 1>worldwide I would say some of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite interiors are very humble</v>

183
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.630
<v Speaker 1>spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

184
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.530
<v Speaker 1>that are really not designed in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were kind of reaction to,</v>

185
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>

186
00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:12.590
<v Speaker 1>making things work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

187
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.170
<v Speaker 1>I've spent a lot of time in Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Greek islands,</v>

188
00:08:16.171 --> 00:08:18.000
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of my favorite,</v>

189
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spaces are really just kind of very</v>

190
00:08:20.581 --> 00:08:22.320
<v Speaker 1>simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very clean.</v>

191
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm open and kind of utilitarian at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain level.</v>
