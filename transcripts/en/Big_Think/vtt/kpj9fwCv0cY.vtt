1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.400
<v Speaker 2>I think they're all a number of</v>
<v Speaker 2>different examples in,</v>

3
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in different places.</v>

4
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it's hard to make sort of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I want to make any sort of sort of a</v>

5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.660
<v Speaker 2>grand statement to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

6
00:00:20.661 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 2>this executive gets it across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are,</v>

7
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

8
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.850
<v Speaker 2>you can point to what the New York Times</v>
<v Speaker 2>is done with,</v>

9
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with our apis instead of making that</v>

10
00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:32.630
<v Speaker 2>information widely available at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guardian has done some similar things in</v>

11
00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:34.430
<v Speaker 2>the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sticking in the UK.</v>

12
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:35.930
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can look at the Telegraph which has</v>

13
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:38.090
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've really begun to sort of figure</v>

14
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:41.330
<v Speaker 2>out what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the core functions that we need</v>

15
00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:44.780
<v Speaker 2>to do and we need to own in house and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the ones that we can outsource.</v>

16
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's sort of technology,</v>

17
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even forms of sort of the content</v>

18
00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:49.550
<v Speaker 2>instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

19
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.921
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

20
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:51.140
<v Speaker 2>and the printing of the papers.</v>

21
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

22
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.040
<v Speaker 2>you can look at the Journal and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've had.</v>

23
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Some of the experiments that they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>done around around paid content and</v>

24
00:00:56.751 --> 00:01:00.860
<v Speaker 2>trying to sort of find out how these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both paid content and free content can</v>

25
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:04.010
<v Speaker 2>coexist on the web,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to sort of have their cake and eat</v>

26
00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:04.550
<v Speaker 2>it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

27
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

28
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.620
<v Speaker 2>with traffic coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also having a,</v>

29
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.650
<v Speaker 2>having a subscriber base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

30
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a,</v>

31
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fte sticking with the paid content</v>

32
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:15.170
<v Speaker 2>side of things where they sort of did</v>
<v Speaker 2>this metered model for content.</v>

33
00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:16.760
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been a number of different</v>

34
00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:20.180
<v Speaker 2>innovations and I think it ranges across</v>
<v Speaker 2>the board.</v>

35
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>La Times.</v>

36
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Another great example of using</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology that's not their own to tell</v>

37
00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:26.240
<v Speaker 2>stories better online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

38
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.820
<v Speaker 2>in this case you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that they use google maps.</v>

39
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:29.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

40
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 2>I kind of always point them out as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

41
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:33.770
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a perfect use case of this where,</v>

42
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>la times coverage of the wildfires,</v>

43
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:39.290
<v Speaker 2>which unfortunately is basically every</v>
<v Speaker 2>year you've got these series of</v>

44
00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:40.124
<v Speaker 2>wildfires.</v>

45
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just,</v>

46
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.580
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take Google maps to take our API.</v>

47
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.620
<v Speaker 2>They plug it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put their images on there,</v>

48
00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:46.790
<v Speaker 2>they put the stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

49
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.550
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they annotate the map to show where the</v>

50
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:52.340
<v Speaker 2>damages were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evacuation areas are the latest</v>

51
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:55.060
<v Speaker 2>developments of it cause it's a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>visual story beyond just the,</v>

52
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.910
<v Speaker 2>the images of the fire itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to see the location of it as well.</v>

53
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a really good example of how</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can use technology that's not their</v>

54
00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:05.630
<v Speaker 2>own to tell stories in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just simply not even possible</v>

55
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.850
<v Speaker 2>offline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take a look at the paper and you</v>

56
00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:08.810
<v Speaker 2>can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well here's,</v>

57
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.240
<v Speaker 2>here's the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's real time.</v>

58
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:13.400
<v Speaker 2>It's dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there are,</v>

59
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.770
<v Speaker 2>there are a number of different people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are doing interesting things and</v>

60
00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:19.520
<v Speaker 2>those are just the big players that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't even touch on all the sort</v>

61
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:22.520
<v Speaker 2>of small startups that are just doing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

62
00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:25.640
<v Speaker 2>really interesting things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some which are just weird and strange</v>

63
00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 2>and ultimately maybe you'd say are bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

64
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.970
<v Speaker 2>but are just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are really encouraging attempts to sort</v>

65
00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:34.070
<v Speaker 2>of try and figure out how to use the</v>
<v Speaker 2>medium differently.</v>

66
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.171
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

67
00:02:38.171 --> 00:02:39.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that they have,</v>

68
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.420
<v Speaker 2>they are very aware of the traffic that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get that is now beyond their</v>

69
00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 2>borders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that gets back into there.</v>

70
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.950
<v Speaker 2>There's the downside to the local</v>
<v Speaker 2>monopoly,</v>

71
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the local newspaper that had a monopoly</v>

72
00:02:50.051 --> 00:02:52.600
<v Speaker 2>on information that all of a sudden it</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of broken down.</v>

73
00:02:52.601 --> 00:02:54.730
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the downside from a business</v>

74
00:02:54.731 --> 00:02:56.800
<v Speaker 2>model standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the upside for the business model is</v>

75
00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>

76
00:02:57.751 --> 00:02:59.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't cost a,</v>

77
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even a fraction of a penny to reach a</v>

78
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:03.380
<v Speaker 2>user who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

79
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 2>tens of thousands of miles away from me</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I've got this great content.</v>

80
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 2>So you see things like the Guardian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Telegraph,</v>

81
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 2>the BBC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

82
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really I would argue is,</v>

83
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

84
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 2>is not just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

85
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a UK source of news is really sort of a</v>

86
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 2>global source of news done in some ways.</v>

87
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 2>It always has been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

88
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that they can reach people on</v>

89
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 2>online is I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is very different.</v>

90
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 2>And they begin to think about how can I</v>
<v Speaker 2>cover stories differently?</v>

91
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's my audience?</v>

92
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 2>I think that the definition of audience</v>
<v Speaker 2>is is rapidly changing.</v>

93
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:35.310
<v Speaker 2>The Guardian experimented a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>with having a,</v>

94
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.210
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

95
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 2>a bureau in the US and trying to set a</v>
<v Speaker 2>target information specifically for</v>

96
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 2>those of us users,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

97
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 2>it's really trying to get those</v>
<v Speaker 2>different perspectives and being able to</v>

98
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 2>read them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just clicking.</v>

99
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean like you don't have to go down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of know that the,</v>

100
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one new stand that has all the</v>

101
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 2>different international magazines and</v>
<v Speaker 2>newspapers.</v>

102
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of maybe sort of frequented by</v>
<v Speaker 2>ex pats.</v>

103
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.700
<v Speaker 2>All that information is online and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's really changed their ideas</v>

104
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 2>of what their audiences and how to reach</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
