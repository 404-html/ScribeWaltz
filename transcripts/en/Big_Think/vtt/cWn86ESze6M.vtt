1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.690
<v Speaker 1>So I got pulled into economics in 2007</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the 2008 economic crisis.</v>

2
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Mike Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who had been the first cfo of Microsoft,</v>

3
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 1>chief financial officer of Microsoft and</v>
<v Speaker 1>treasure of Microsoft.</v>

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>He came to Toronto in 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took my wife and I out to dinner and</v>

5
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:25.071
<v Speaker 1>said he's trying to put together a</v>
<v Speaker 1>research group to work on economics and</v>

6
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>he would like me to be involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

7
00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>that's okay because nobody does and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole system is about to collapse.</v>

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>He said the the balance sheets of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big investment banks,</v>

10
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like they have cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're full of holes.</v>

11
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>And I remember being very struck by this</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is before anybody was</v>

12
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>talking about this and so I started to</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet with a group of people that he was</v>

13
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:53.601
<v Speaker 1>pulling together to understand what was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen and to understand if</v>

14
00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>there was any way to save the situation.</v>

15
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>It was a very ambitious thing and of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course we failed.</v>

16
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>But along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was motivated as a kind of public</v>

17
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:06.831
<v Speaker 1>service to get interested in economics</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what I found economics in a way it's</v>

18
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>very easy for a physicist to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's very mathematical and the</v>

19
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:15.960
<v Speaker 1>mathematical models that they use a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean.</v>

20
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>They're based on assumptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypotheses,</v>

21
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>and you can study them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as I started it,</v>

22
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I began to understand some for myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more from just reading around</v>

23
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>because the false with the standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic models with the standard models</v>

24
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>of finance are well known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There had been in the literature for</v>

25
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Speaker 1>decades and decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me give some examples.</v>

26
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.180
<v Speaker 1>The Standard Model of economics is</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the neoclassical model and</v>

27
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>assumes that markets are systems where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's trading happens between consumers</v>

28
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>and firms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's certain simple models of how</v>

29
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>that goes on and the ideas that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to equilibrium equilibrium.</v>

30
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Not In the physical sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but especially economic sense in which</v>

31
00:01:57.811 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>you reach a point at which the prices</v>
<v Speaker 1>are fixed,</v>

32
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.980
<v Speaker 1>such that market forces fix the prices</v>
<v Speaker 1>such that you maximize the happiness of</v>

33
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>the consumers and maximize the profits</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the firms.</v>

34
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.640
<v Speaker 1>And in so-called equilibrium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody can become happier or more</v>

35
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:21.860
<v Speaker 1>profitable without somebody else</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming less happier,</v>

36
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.470
<v Speaker 1>less profitable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ideology behind this,</v>

37
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>not behind the mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because mathematics doesn't have an</v>

38
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but behind the arguments that were made</v>

39
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:36.360
<v Speaker 1>and still are made from this model is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mark has don't need regulation</v>

40
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>because they have these natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>equilibrium where everybody benefits to</v>

41
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>the maximum possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're in equilibrium,</v>

42
00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:48.870
<v Speaker 1>you can't do better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a fault with this,</v>

43
00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>and it's an obvious follow has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>known since the 19 seventies from some</v>

44
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>theorems approved by some economists</v>
<v Speaker 1>including,</v>

45
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the founders of this field of</v>

46
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>mathematical economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

47
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>that does not one equilibrium.</v>

48
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>There are many equilibria in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a vast number of equilibria.</v>

49
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.390
<v Speaker 1>And so which equilibria even assuming</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is a decent model of the</v>

50
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economy,</v>

51
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>which is not clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even assuming it's a good mile,</v>

52
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>which equilibrium you're in depends on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past history,</v>

53
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>depends on regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on politics,</v>

54
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>depends on taste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on changing tastes,</v>

55
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>changing preferences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so history matters.</v>

56
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>And what's called path dependence</v>
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

57
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>This takes us outside of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>neoclassical model of economics,</v>

58
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:42.601
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't take us outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>economics because some wiser economist,</v>

59
00:03:42.921 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian Arthur had for years been</v>

60
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:49.951
<v Speaker 1>developing models and theories of path</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent economy with a history does</v>

61
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People from the area of complex systems</v>

62
00:03:55.391 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 1>like Stu Koufman and provocative and</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing models of markets where the</v>

63
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>history matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's not a single equilibrium</v>

64
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 1>where there many equilibria and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>change is paramount,</v>

65
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.710
<v Speaker 1>and another symptom of this is is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that arbitrage isn't.</v>

66
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean in these neoclassical models,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go to equilibrium,</v>

67
00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 1>arbitrage is impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arbitrize and making a profit from</v>

68
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:27.820
<v Speaker 1>trading around a circle goods or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>circle of currencies without actually</v>

69
00:04:27.821 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 1>producing anything and in equilibrium</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's supposed to be impossible,</v>

70
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>but lots of firms and investment banks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and made fortunes off of currency</v>

71
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 1>trading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why is that?</v>

72
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Turns out because you never really at</v>
<v Speaker 1>equilibrium.</v>

73
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.160
<v Speaker 1>So why is the notion of equilibrium so</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful?</v>

74
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the answer is this idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of physics envy that economists thought</v>

75
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 1>that what they were doing was more</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific,</v>

76
00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 1>has more corrected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like physics and physics had</v>

77
00:04:56.981 --> 00:05:01.981
<v Speaker 1>this timeless picture in which we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>really mattered as we were saying</v>

78
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the whole history of the system and</v>

79
00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:07.360
<v Speaker 1>in physics there's also a big notion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming to equilibrium,</v>

80
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 1>which is though however it's important</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say as a different notion of</v>

81
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:15.361
<v Speaker 1>equilibrium and somehow people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>economics got seduced into this model,</v>

82
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 1>which again works in the small.</v>

83
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.990
<v Speaker 1>If you have a small little corner of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>

84
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:23.530
<v Speaker 1>a small market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may work for awhile to characterize</v>

85
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:28.531
<v Speaker 1>approximately what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arbitrage is not always there.</v>

86
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:32.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I recharge.</v>

87
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Opportunities do get eaten up the market</v>
<v Speaker 1>forces which do push you towards</v>

88
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.500
<v Speaker 1>equilibria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is some truth in it,</v>

89
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.990
<v Speaker 1>but the whole thing is a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can say that as an outsider and it</v>

90
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 1>led indirectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the only reason why</v>

91
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.370
<v Speaker 1>regulations were lifted on markets and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trading through the decades,</v>

92
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 1>but when people were making arguments to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress,</v>

93
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 1>to the president's office there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be that the economy would be</v>

94
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:07.790
<v Speaker 1>better off without regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the quote,</v>

95
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:12.791
<v Speaker 1>scientific rationale for it and led to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very unstable situation of the last</v>

96
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:19.301
<v Speaker 1>economic crisis and still a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and unstable situation in the</v>

97
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 1>world economy because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

98
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an economist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to pontificate about the</v>

99
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 1>problems in the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one could see</v>

100
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.450
<v Speaker 1>how the idea of timelessness gave false</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfort to an unsuccessful scientific</v>

101
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 1>theory in the realm of economists of</v>
<v Speaker 1>economics.</v>
