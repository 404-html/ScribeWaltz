1
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's been terrible.</v>

2
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.690
<v Speaker 1>I think the whole embedding process was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a masterstroke of the Pentagon's,</v>

4
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:27.171
<v Speaker 1>a ability to sort of turn journalists</v>
<v Speaker 1>into cheerleaders and I'm a co op and he</v>

5
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>sort of independent thinking it's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard as a journalist to go into a</v>

6
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:35.240
<v Speaker 1>conflict completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh eyed when you've been through</v>

8
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>training courses where you have to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put on a gas mask and nine seconds</v>

9
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:43.890
<v Speaker 1>flat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:48.891
<v Speaker 1>where you are traveling with US troops</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're expecting to be gassed by</v>

11
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:55.101
<v Speaker 1>these terrible Iraqis at any moment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are shooting at you as you go</v>

12
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>through a country and the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting you with the ones that you're</v>

13
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be writing about as one</v>
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>

14
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully one part of a conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunately the,</v>

15
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

16
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coverage was very obviously one</v>

17
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>sided because there was no access to any</v>
<v Speaker 1>other side.</v>

18
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.490
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was for a while,</v>

19
00:01:18.491 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Baghdad fell and as it was falling,</v>

20
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
<v Speaker 1>a number of us left rm beds as quickly</v>
<v Speaker 1>as possible and tried to get out and</v>

21
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>into a meet and live with a Iraqis in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baghdad.</v>

22
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

23
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened for a number of months</v>

24
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:40.590
<v Speaker 1>before the kidnappings and the situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

25
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>in Baghdad became so dangerous that</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists will no longer able to go</v>

26
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>out and freely report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

27
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>

28
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>we have a situation where most of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>

29
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>fresh news from journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least Western journalists in,</v>

30
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.833
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>in Iraq is being done from behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:04.911
<v Speaker 1>behind the lines of American troops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm with only feelers being sent out</v>

33
00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:09.920
<v Speaker 1>for very quick runs into a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:13.080
<v Speaker 1>the Iraqi.</v>
