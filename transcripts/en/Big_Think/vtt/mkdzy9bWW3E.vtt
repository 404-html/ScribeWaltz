00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.370
<v Speaker 1>There's been some fascinating research</v>
<v Speaker 1>to suggest that when we play games and</v>

2
00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:10.681
<v Speaker 1>we tap into positive emotions like</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity and optimism and creativity,</v>

3
00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:13.840
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even love that these emotions</v>

4
00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:17.980
<v Speaker 1>actually stayed with us for up to 24</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours after we finished playing the</v>

5
00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:20.740
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So studies have shown that we're more</v>

6
00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:25.741
<v Speaker 1>likely to cooperate with someone in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>real lives after we played a social game</v>

7
00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:27.730
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're doing some kind of</v>

8
00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:32.731
<v Speaker 1>cooperative mission over more likely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>set an ambitious goal for ourselves.</v>

9
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.590
<v Speaker 1>After we've succeeded in a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

10
00:00:35.591 --> 00:00:39.100
<v Speaker 1>we'll speak up more for ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll even flirt with more attractive</v>

11
00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:42.640
<v Speaker 1>strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this kind of transfer of our</v>

12
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:44.890
<v Speaker 1>confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our creativity,</v>

13
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.100
<v Speaker 1>of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our ambition to our real lives.</v>

14
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.000
<v Speaker 1>We have this idea that playing games is</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a waste of time,</v>

15
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's not a very productive way to</v>

16
00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:56.620
<v Speaker 1>spend our time.</v>

17
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.300
<v Speaker 1>And I kept hearing that even as I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>evangelizing all of the benefits of</v>

18
00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:03.490
<v Speaker 1>gaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emotional benefits of social,</v>

19
00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:06.130
<v Speaker 1>the psychological benefits people kept</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

20
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:06.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

21
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.910
<v Speaker 1>it's just a waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't we be doing something more</v>

22
00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:11.530
<v Speaker 1>productive than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.760
<v Speaker 1>avenging some angry birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it really made me wonder,</v>

24
00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:18.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we mean by productive?</v>

25
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity is about producing</v>

26
00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:23.950
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we really want to produce more</v>

27
00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:26.920
<v Speaker 1>of in our lives and in the lives of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people around us?</v>

28
00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:29.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we trying to produce more emails or,</v>

29
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we trying to produce more positive</v>

30
00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:34.900
<v Speaker 1>emotion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we trying to produce stronger</v>

31
00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:38.170
<v Speaker 1>relationships?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we trying to produce a sense of</v>

32
00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:41.650
<v Speaker 1>meaning and purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that Games are actually</v>

33
00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:45.520
<v Speaker 1>quite good at producing those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they produce more of and</v>

34
00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:49.930
<v Speaker 1>better than almost anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when people say Games are a waste of</v>

35
00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:53.650
<v Speaker 1>time and not productive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would challenge them to ask</v>

36
00:01:53.651 --> 00:01:55.660
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to produce more of?</v>

37
00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.400
<v Speaker 1>And if it's things like better</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships and more positive emotion</v>

38
00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:03.730
<v Speaker 1>in my daily life than games might be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most productive thing you can do.</v>
