00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Education is in and of itself a personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit,</v>

2
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people have in a democratic</v>

4
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:20.200
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>so before we get to a discussion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits,</v>

6
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.680
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about education as a right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each person in a democratic society</v>

7
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.560
<v Speaker 1>as a right from the earliest age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say age three all the way through</v>

8
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 1>and including</v>
<v Speaker 1>couch</v>

9
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.510
<v Speaker 1>to have a fully funded paid education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This should be one of the foundational</v>

10
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>purposes of government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

11
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:55.491
<v Speaker 1>when a child has the chance from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earliest age age to learn languages</v>

12
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 1>to learn English communication skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they then become able to participate in</v>

13
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 1>a community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as young people grow,</v>

14
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>that community keeps expanding from</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

15
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>from the village to the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the world.</v>

16
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.860
<v Speaker 1>We need to have our young people the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best educated in science and language</v>

17
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.180
<v Speaker 1>and the arts and music and literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.050
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's so many different areas</v>

19
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>of human endeavor that our children</v>
<v Speaker 1>should have the chance to excel it.</v>

20
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check out the cost of tuition and Iowa.</v>

21
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.060
<v Speaker 1>My friends ask yourself how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>families are being excluded from having</v>

22
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:51.630
<v Speaker 1>their young people be able to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>school because they just can't afford</v>

23
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then let's talk about the world.</v>
