1
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 2>California should do to fix its economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think first you've got to recognize</v>

3
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.930
<v Speaker 2>California has enormous potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a,</v>

4
00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:22.931
<v Speaker 2>it's a great environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very open to new ideas.</v>

5
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Silicon Valley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got great universities,</v>

6
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

7
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both the University of California in the</v>

8
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 2>private universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the potential is tremendous.</v>

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 2>What we really need to do in California</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to deal with a serious budget</v>

10
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means spending,</v>

11
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:44.571
<v Speaker 2>grows too much and then taxes rise and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that tends to drive out businesses and</v>

12
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.360
<v Speaker 2>ultimately as harmful to the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say number one in terms of</v>

13
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:52.680
<v Speaker 2>the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is put some limit on the growth of</v>

14
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 2>spending population growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus inflation is one way to do it,</v>

15
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would prevent the ups and downs in</v>

16
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the deficit spending usually rises</v>

17
00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:08.510
<v Speaker 2>rapidly when tax revenues arrive and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then tax revenues fall off and you've</v>

18
00:01:08.511 --> 00:01:09.700
<v Speaker 2>got this huge deficit.</v>

19
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 2>So control the growth of spending number</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

20
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it put in some,</v>

21
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tax reforms to prevent the ups and downs</v>

22
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 2>and revenues to be so great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here we've got a huge cyclical,</v>

23
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 2>a performance in tax revenues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would adopt some of the proposals</v>

24
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:30.400
<v Speaker 2>of the recent California Tax Commission</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a governor Schwarzenegger,</v>

25
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 2>I introduced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Third Education,</v>

26
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.500
<v Speaker 2>k 12 it slipping in California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's not a matter of spending a</v>

27
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 2>lot of spent in California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really demanding more</v>

28
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 2>accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to see a program where there's</v>

29
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 2>more for teachers and less for</v>
<v Speaker 2>administration on.</v>

30
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.920
<v Speaker 2>I think that would do a lot of them.</v>
