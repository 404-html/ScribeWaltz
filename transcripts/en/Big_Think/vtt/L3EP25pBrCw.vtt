00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people try to draw a line and say,</v>

2
00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:12.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some animals are this and other animals,</v>

3
00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:14.230
<v Speaker 1>so not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are differences across</v>

4
00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:16.390
<v Speaker 1>species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all species,</v>

5
00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:20.740
<v Speaker 1>all individuals within a species deserve</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be treated with respect and</v>

6
00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:23.110
<v Speaker 1>compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As individuals.</v>

7
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.090
<v Speaker 1>I see everything on a continuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see psychological continuity between</v>

8
00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:32.890
<v Speaker 1>humans and the other animals and across</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dolphins and primates,</v>

9
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>and that simply reflects the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution works by building upon</v>

10
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.820
<v Speaker 1>existing structures and processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's reflected in the fact that we</v>

11
00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:50.311
<v Speaker 1>all share a common psychology and each</v>
<v Speaker 1>species each.</v>

12
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.040
<v Speaker 1>If you're an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter whether you're a dolphin or a</v>

13
00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:59.041
<v Speaker 1>monkey or a person or an Aardvark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have that basic psychology that's</v>

14
00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:04.330
<v Speaker 1>just changed a little bit depending upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>what species you are.</v>
