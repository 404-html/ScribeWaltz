1
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.250
<v Speaker 1>The short answer I would say is anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the real answer I think is almost</v>

2
00:00:09.251 --> 00:00:10.510
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.010
<v Speaker 1>I am very comfortable with the system</v>
<v Speaker 1>that for a very acute period of time</v>

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.530
<v Speaker 1>protects people from their own worst</v>
<v Speaker 1>instincts.</v>

5
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.450
<v Speaker 1>But I do mean a very acute period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

6
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.230
<v Speaker 1>I think the power dogmatic and Campbell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone you might want to prevent</v>

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.070
<v Speaker 1>from committing suicide is the teenager</v>
<v Speaker 1>who breaks up with a boyfriend or</v>

8
00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:31.150
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend and tries to overdose on</v>
<v Speaker 1>tylenol and to tell them for a few days</v>

9
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.130
<v Speaker 1>we're going to hospitalize you against</v>
<v Speaker 1>your will.</v>

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see men unreasonable to me.</v>

11
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.660
<v Speaker 1>In contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who has suffered from chronic</v>

12
00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:40.960
<v Speaker 1>depression throughout their life with</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple suicide attempts.</v>

13
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Clearly modern medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern psychiatry has been unable to</v>

14
00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:44.990
<v Speaker 1>help this person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.120
<v Speaker 1>while I wouldn't necessarily choose to</v>
<v Speaker 1>end my life under those circumstances,</v>

16
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.160
<v Speaker 1>I be respect someone else's right to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

17
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.390
<v Speaker 1>So the real standard I would use is does</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person on the one hand have</v>

18
00:00:55.391 --> 00:00:57.940
<v Speaker 1>capacity to make this decision?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they thinking clearly?</v>

19
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Are they thinking rationally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And secondly,</v>

20
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.790
<v Speaker 1>can they demonstrate this capacity over</v>
<v Speaker 1>a prolonged period of several days</v>

21
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.210
<v Speaker 1>rather than being in an instant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the vast majority of people</v>

22
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.140
<v Speaker 1>who wish to commit suicide wouldn't eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the both of those criteria.</v>
