1
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.790
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an incredible,</v>

2
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:07.800
<v Speaker 1>except it's a great experience actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I sort of wandered into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this business.</v>

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm inadvertently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the book publishing business</v>

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.683
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.020
<v Speaker 1>I started to publish books about</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and about the Internet so</v>

8
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose I'm earlier than most,</v>

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through this product that really had</v>

11
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with the internet or</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

12
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being about those subjects introduced me</v>

13
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this business.</v>

14
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:45.480
<v Speaker 1>And in New York I became sort of very</v>
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>

15
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:50.160
<v Speaker 1>one of the few people who had any claim</v>
<v Speaker 1>on knowing anything about this business,</v>

16
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>although I'd like to footnote that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>really knew nothing at all.</v>

17
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.340
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Speaker 1>but as this business started to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to um,</v>

19
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to heat up anybody who had any claim on</v>

20
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>it was suddenly at the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 1>at center stage.</v>

22
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.590
<v Speaker 1>it was a opportunity knocking venture</v>
<v Speaker 1>capital came my way and I began to build</v>

24
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:20.730
<v Speaker 1>a company again having no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>what kind of company I was building or</v>
<v Speaker 1>really any idea about the business in</v>

27
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Speaker 1>which I was building this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

28
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this company.</v>

29
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>So this was truly learning on the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can only say in my defense that</v>

32
00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 1>virtually everybody who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was starting Internet businesses at</v>

33
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 1>that point in time was also learning on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the job.</v>

34
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

35
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

36
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned I'm not enough,</v>

37
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.770
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>nobody in those days learned enough and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually everyone went under and I went</v>

40
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:04.750
<v Speaker 1>under as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the fortunate position to be</v>

42
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

43
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell the story and I wrote a book</v>

44
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:16.700
<v Speaker 1>called burn rate and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

46
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.490
<v Speaker 1>which I still think as serves as one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great cautionary tales of,</v>

47
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>of the period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

48
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

49
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do it again in a heartbeat.</v>

50
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.920
<v Speaker 1>I took certain steps when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I started newser to ensure that,</v>

51
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:39.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

52
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.360
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

53
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.300
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had gotten somewhat older and I didn't</v>

54
00:02:45.301 --> 00:02:47.250
<v Speaker 1>think that I wouldn't necessarily be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to,</v>

55
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.310
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my system would be able to,</v>

56
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tolerate the highs and lows of,</v>

57
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.170
<v Speaker 1>of the first experience in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Internet.</v>

58
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:57.920
<v Speaker 1>So I went into newser with um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

59
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.420
<v Speaker 1>with a few safety measures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

60
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.880
<v Speaker 1>my partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

61
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>in nooser is someone who absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what he's doing,</v>

62
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 1>who has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started two successful companies.</v>

64
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He founded hoovers.com,</v>

65
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>hadn't took that public and then sold</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

66
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Dun and Bradstreet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he started high beam,</v>

67
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 1>which I'm an another news database</v>
<v Speaker 1>company which he sold.</v>

68
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:30.901
<v Speaker 1>So I feel in a remarkably good hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

69
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the editor and chief of news there is</v>

<v Speaker 1>also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

71
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caroline Miller,</v>

72
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>who was the editor and chief of the New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York magazine,</v>

73
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 1>credibly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

74
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional and,</v>

75
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.410
<v Speaker 1>and tenacious and accomplished woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in reality,</v>

76
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm at news or I do very little.</v>
