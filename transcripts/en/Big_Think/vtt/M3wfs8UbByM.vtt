1
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when it happened in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

2
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.910
<v Speaker 1>but we become obsessed with the concept</v>
<v Speaker 1>of having a vision.</v>

3
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's this overwhelming pressure</v>

4
00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:17.530
<v Speaker 1>on entrepreneurs or any of us for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>

5
00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:19.540
<v Speaker 1>that we all have to have a vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People even ask us.</v>

6
00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:22.030
<v Speaker 1>So what's your vision?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your vision in your job?</v>

7
00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:23.770
<v Speaker 1>What kind of vision do you want to build</v>
<v Speaker 1>or follow?</v>

8
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.200
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not all visionaries.</v>

9
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't all have big change.</v>

10
00:00:28.421 --> 00:00:31.510
<v Speaker 1>The world's kind of visions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if we have some sense of it,</v>

11
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.010
<v Speaker 1>very few of us are really capable or</v>
<v Speaker 1>able of articulating that vision and</v>

12
00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:40.270
<v Speaker 1>words so clearly than others could</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that same world that we imagine</v>

13
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's just a feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think it puts an unfair stress</v>

14
00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:47.050
<v Speaker 1>and an unfair burden on all of us that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to have a vision.</v>

15
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to go to work and be happy</v>

16
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:51.970
<v Speaker 1>and feel like my life and my work is</v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>

17
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Do I need more than that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do believe we have to find</v>

18
00:00:56.471 --> 00:00:58.570
<v Speaker 1>division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to have direction.</v>

19
00:00:58.571 --> 00:01:01.720
<v Speaker 1>We have to have a north star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to know where we're going.</v>

20
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.030
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be the direction we</v>
<v Speaker 1>set.</v>

21
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.770
<v Speaker 1>It can be the direction that somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else said.</v>

22
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.570
<v Speaker 1>So it's very important for us to find a</v>
<v Speaker 1>leader or find a company or find a</v>

23
00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:15.571
<v Speaker 1>vision in whom we believe so that our</v>
<v Speaker 1>work is contributing to building that.</v>

24
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.230
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:17.231 --> 00:01:20.650
<v Speaker 1>and the civil rights era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some may not have been able to clearly</v>

26
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:22.150
<v Speaker 1>articulate the vision that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagined,</v>

27
00:01:22.151 --> 00:01:24.910
<v Speaker 1>but Martin Luther King did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for the rest of us,</v>

28
00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:26.650
<v Speaker 1>we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm following him.</v>

29
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm following that vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the vision I believe in.</v>

30
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should all find division that we</v>

31
00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:36.790
<v Speaker 1>believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should find common direction and then</v>

32
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:40.750
<v Speaker 1>that vision can become ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we don't have to invent it and we</v>

33
00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:43.180
<v Speaker 1>don't have to originate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we absolutely have the</v>

34
00:01:43.181 --> 00:01:45.730
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to find a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

35
00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:46.960
<v Speaker 1>or other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.011
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entity out there,</v>

37
00:01:48.011 --> 00:01:52.960
<v Speaker 1>other person or organization that puts</v>
<v Speaker 1>in towards the vision that we absolutely</v>

38
00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:56.200
<v Speaker 1>believe in and would commit our blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sweat and tears to help build.</v>

39
00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.200
<v Speaker 1>If we do not have that fire in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>belly,</v>

40
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.180
<v Speaker 1>the way we go about igniting it is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually to set out on a journey of self</v>

41
00:02:04.181 --> 00:02:05.770
<v Speaker 1>discovery and do everything by</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves,</v>

42
00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:09.040
<v Speaker 1>but rather to ask for help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole point is that we are better</v>

43
00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:10.330
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

44
00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:13.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of joke about the fact that</v>

45
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.580
<v Speaker 1>there's an entire section in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bookshop called self help,</v>

46
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.330
<v Speaker 1>but there's no section in the bookshop</v>
<v Speaker 1>called help others.</v>

47
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.960
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not about how I can find the job of</v>

48
00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>my dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the question is,</v>

49
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:29.260
<v Speaker 1>is how can I help my friends find a</v>
<v Speaker 1>career of endless fulfillment.</v>

50
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not about how I can lose 10 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how can I help my friend that</v>

51
00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:37.120
<v Speaker 1>somebody I love live a healthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle.</v>

52
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.340
<v Speaker 1>And the amazing thing is is that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're willing to ask for help or when</v>

53
00:02:42.341 --> 00:02:44.770
<v Speaker 1>we're willing to set ourselves out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help others,</v>

54
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.470
<v Speaker 1>that in itself helps us solve our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

55
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.310
<v Speaker 1>So the irony is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the way to ignite the fire in our</v>

56
00:02:51.311 --> 00:02:54.970
<v Speaker 1>bellies is to help others ignite the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

57
00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:58.660
<v Speaker 1>And there is an in so doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will find the thing that excites us.</v>

58
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>People often ask me for good examples of</v>
<v Speaker 1>vision,</v>

59
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

60
00:03:04.671 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe vision should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that is if theorial it</v>

61
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be something that lives in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>imaginations,</v>

62
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 1>I believe visions and positionings or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you wanna call them.</v>

63
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I like to call it the why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's why we get out of bed every</v>

64
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why our organization exists.</v>

65
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>And one of my favorite expressions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the why is the declaration of</v>

66
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

67
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>why does America Exist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we actually declared it,</v>

68
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 1>we actually declared why we needed our</v>
<v Speaker 1>own country,</v>

69
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 1>why we needed to separate from Great</v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain.</v>

70
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>And we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we had a simple belief,</v>

71
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 1>we believe that all men were created</v>
<v Speaker 1>equal,</v>

72
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 1>that every single one of us was</v>
<v Speaker 1>entitled,</v>

73
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>endowed with these unalienable rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst which include life,</v>

74
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the pursuit of happiness.</v>

75
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a north star was set for this country.</v>

76
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>And when we are at our natural best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are working hard to provide equality</v>

77
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>for all women's suffrage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil rights,</v>

78
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay rights.</v>

79
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 1>You know the ability for everybody to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to school,</v>

80
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 1>the ability for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every child have a doctor.</v>

81
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 1>This is what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we are at our natural best,</v>

82
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:03.700
<v Speaker 1>when we're trying to figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of the systems are perfect,</v>

83
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>but my goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we try hard,</v>

84
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to advance the equality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that is when America is actually</v>

85
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 1>America and we know that to be the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not up for debate.</v>

86
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>It's because it was written down for us</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so great organizations,</v>

87
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.990
<v Speaker 1>they should also declare why we need</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to exist because it certainly ain't</v>

88
00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 1>in their product because none of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a product that's that special that</v>

89
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>we have to have it and we can't get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>from someone else.</v>

90
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 1>And even if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's temporary and that's the point.</v>

91
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 1>The product ain't it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the declaration.</v>

92
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.290
<v Speaker 1>It's the reason why we need you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

93
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 1>It's your idealism and your ambition for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world in which you operate,</v>

94
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.660
<v Speaker 1>that you hope to advance.</v>

95
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Jefferson said himself the</v>
<v Speaker 1>declaration of independence.</v>

96
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 1>The statement that he had was for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole world,</v>

97
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.360
<v Speaker 1>but America would take it upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to lead,</v>

98
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 1>to try to be the experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So too should be the visions of</v>

99
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.700
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the visions that we have should be for</v>

100
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:56.020
<v Speaker 1>every company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for everyone,</v>

101
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 1>but we will take it upon ourselves to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make our organization the example of</v>

102
00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 1>what great looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the declaration of independence,</v>

103
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>and it is written in such a perfect form</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

104
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.400
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't start by complaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It starts by idealizing,</v>

105
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.760
<v Speaker 1>and then it gets into all of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are in the way the of the,</v>

106
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.830
<v Speaker 1>of this ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we set out to overcome.</v>
