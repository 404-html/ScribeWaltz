WEBVTT

1
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Short is more difficult and I think we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be recognized.</v>

2
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in for a,</v>

3
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.680
<v Speaker 1>a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>

4
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.510
<v Speaker 1>a top problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>things have not even reached the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the problems that we face is not</v>

6
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.660
<v Speaker 1>only if we lost confidence in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial institutions,</v>

7
00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:42.580
<v Speaker 1>we've lost confidence in votes who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be managing our economy.</v>

8
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you for a fact,</v>

9
00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:47.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were going around your friends</v>

10
00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:49.380
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a g eight,</v>

11
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.690
<v Speaker 1>seven meetings and saying last May</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying we've turned the corner,</v>

12
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are turning up.</v>

13
00:00:56.321 --> 00:01:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Things are going well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm clearly,</v>

14
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were either doing a sales job or</v>

15
00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:06.640
<v Speaker 1>they didn't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in either case,</v>

16
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.760
<v Speaker 1>why should anybody listen to these guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

17
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>they've been so consistently wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

18
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

19
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.700
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.950
<v Speaker 1>there is this crisis of confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.290
<v Speaker 1>the problems we're going to get worse.</v>

22
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're only about halfway through the</v>

23
00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:31.381
<v Speaker 1>fall and the housing prices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>housing prices go down more,</v>

24
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.620
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more foreclosures will occur halfway</v>

25
00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:38.860
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming we don't overshoot that is to</v>

26
00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:41.890
<v Speaker 1>say when you have a bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the bubble breaks,</v>

27
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.620
<v Speaker 1>you don't typically go back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal level.</v>

28
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.900
<v Speaker 1>You go further down and then you bounce</v>
<v Speaker 1>back up.</v>

29
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.260
<v Speaker 1>So things may be even worse than what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just suggested.</v>

30
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.730
<v Speaker 1>If there is overshooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>

31
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.780
<v Speaker 1>states and localities are facing serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

32
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Revenues are plummeting here in New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>City.</v>

33
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.940
<v Speaker 1>New York state depends very heavily on</v>
<v Speaker 1>revenues from the financial sector.</v>

34
00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:08.500
<v Speaker 1>It's plummeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.810
<v Speaker 1>but states and localities depends have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call it a balanced budget</v>

36
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>framework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When revenues go down,</v>

37
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.720
<v Speaker 1>they have to cut back expenditures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as they cut back expenditures,</v>

38
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>the economy goes further down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>AIESEC several months ago that the first</v>

39
00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:30.991
<v Speaker 1>agenda in stimulus ought to be to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>up for the shortfall in this state and</v>

40
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 1>local revenues.</v>

41
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a downward pressure</v>

42
00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:40.510
<v Speaker 1>on the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut back of services to the poor,</v>

43
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.670
<v Speaker 1>a cutback of investments that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basis of longterm economic growth.</v>

44
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.900
<v Speaker 1>But the Bush administration decided to</v>
<v Speaker 1>give a tax cut.</v>

45
00:02:49.901 --> 00:02:53.140
<v Speaker 1>They think the tax cut a is a solution</v>
<v Speaker 1>to every problem.</v>

46
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.760
<v Speaker 1>The tax cuts were part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem of America is not that we</v>

47
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 1>consume too little with the savings rate</v>
<v Speaker 1>of zero.</v>

48
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>How could anybody say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet that was the solution that the Bush</v>

49
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>administration put forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

50
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.620
<v Speaker 1>the future cutbacks in state and local</v>
<v Speaker 1>expenditures are going to depress the</v>

52
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>as the banking sector faces problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be more reluctant to</v>

54
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>lend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as people see their houses price go</v>

55
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be more reluctant to</v>

56
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:27.350
<v Speaker 1>borrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

57
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>the lack of transparency means that even</v>
<v Speaker 1>banks won't lend to each other.</v>

58
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>So if there's a bank with money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be willing to lend to</v>

59
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 1>a bank with the problem because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know what the risk that it faces</v>

60
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

61
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're good.</v>

62
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Mike say it only in the first half of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this game,</v>

63
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.630
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would expect that the problems to</v>

65
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 1>continue to unfold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're in a very difficult</v>

66
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:57.710
<v Speaker 1>position because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 1>people that we turn to</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditionally have been the financial</v>

68
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>markets and there are two reasons not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust them at this point.</v>

69
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've shown an enormous in competence.</v>

70
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Why should we trust these people who got</v>
<v Speaker 1>us into the mess to get us out of it?</v>

71
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Their judgments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their understanding of the economy is</v>

72
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:18.250
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very limited.</v>

73
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 1>They understand how to make money in</v>
<v Speaker 1>good times,</v>

74
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 1>how to protect themselves at the expense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their investors.</v>

75
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.970
<v Speaker 1>They understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're talking about a systemic and</v>

76
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>economic why phenomena and they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly demonstrated a lack of</v>

77
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 1>competence in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And secondly,</v>

78
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>they have a vested interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

79
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

80
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.470
<v Speaker 1>they want to protect their own future</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're willing to let the economy</v>

81
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:49.490
<v Speaker 1>go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

82
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly a secretary treasurer try to</v>

83
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>get Wall Street to come together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

84
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks help Lehmann brothers.</v>

85
00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:58.234
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

86
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 1>we'd rather see the economy go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then to put our balance sheet at risk,</v>

87
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.990
<v Speaker 1>so their interests are clearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>divergent.</v>

88
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Take Fatty Mac and Fannie Mae.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we did the first bailout didn't</v>

89
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did the first bail out?</v>

90
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Right after that they found Fannie Mae a</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>

91
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:20.650
<v Speaker 1>a dividend payment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting the taxpayer even more at risk.</v>

92
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.110
<v Speaker 1>They were taking money out as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government was saying,</v>

93
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:24.320
<v Speaker 1>we'll put money in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

94
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.940
<v Speaker 1>it's unconscionable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a clear divergence of</v>

95
00:05:27.941 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 1>interest so we can't turn to them.</v>

96
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.050
<v Speaker 1>We can't turn to political leaders that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are dependent on money from the</v>

97
00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:42.781
<v Speaker 1>lobbyists from Wall Street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is particularly true with the</v>

98
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.590
<v Speaker 1>Republican Party in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this coming election.</v>

99
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.400
<v Speaker 1>So I think on unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think we have to turn to</v>

100
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>academics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who've studied the matter that</v>

101
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 1>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a vested interest other than</v>

102
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 1>the best interest of making sure our</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy functions well and our jobs are</v>

103
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>protected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

104
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:04.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

105
00:06:04.861 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 1>and our families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our houses don't go down,</v>

106
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's that broader national interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think,</v>

107
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really have to be protecting.</v>

108
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think we can turn to one</v>
<v Speaker 1>street to get the answer.</v>
