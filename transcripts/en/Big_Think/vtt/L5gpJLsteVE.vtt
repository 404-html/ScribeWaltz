1
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's a single model</v>

2
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:14.850
<v Speaker 1>we'd want to learn from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you want to take bits and pieces</v>

3
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>from a number of different models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think if you look to Europe,</v>

5
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:22.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of the things you could say</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much across the board,</v>

6
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking Western Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the countries that are closest</v>

7
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>to the u s and living standards that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do work many fewer hours.</v>

8
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:30.120
<v Speaker 1>And that is something that I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

9
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker 1>their value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea I know may Europeans,</v>

10
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.021
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're amazed.</v>

11
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they I think made them,</v>

12
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>don't even believe me when I say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people here don't have the cations.</v>

13
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously a lot of people do,</v>

14
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>but there are many tens of millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that don't and there's certainly</v>

15
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>no guarantee of a vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:48.360
<v Speaker 1>so paid time off that people know they</v>
<v Speaker 1>could get four or five weeks vacation,</v>

17
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely standard in Europe.</v>

18
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Some countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denmark has six weeks.</v>

19
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think that's something that that's</v>

20
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>very valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give people time off.</v>

21
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.511
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

22
00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:59.130
<v Speaker 1>parental leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>this is conservatives like to see a</v>
<v Speaker 1>women stay home with their kids.</v>

24
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't care whether it's women or men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that people have that</v>

25
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.040
<v Speaker 1>option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's very good because it's,</v>

26
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a real strain for people to juggle</v>
<v Speaker 1>a job and work.</v>

27
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that makes a big difference.</v>

28
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy use a Europe across Europe,</v>

29
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>average energy use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greenhouse gas emissions,</v>

30
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:22.770
<v Speaker 1>about half of what is the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though they're very comparable</v>

31
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:23.910
<v Speaker 1>living standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use much,</v>

32
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>much less energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of that is that they have more mass</v>

33
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:28.710
<v Speaker 1>transit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of is it's more concentrated,</v>

34
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people live closer together,</v>

35
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:31.780
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.860
<v Speaker 1>people wrongly in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because we're such a big country</v>

37
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>that's really not the case.</v>

38
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>And obviously we're a big country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not why we're so spread out.</v>

39
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 1>We have land use policies that basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>promotes sprawl.</v>

40
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>And in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've quite consciously designed</v>

41
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>policies that have been intended to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight sprawl.</v>

42
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>And I think it would make sense for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States to do that as well.</v>

43
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Make it easier for people live in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cities.</v>

44
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it easier or near in suburbs rather</v>

45
00:01:56.011 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 1>than build out 90 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have people commuting an hour and a half</v>

46
00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>each way each day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a number of different practices that</v>

47
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:05.220
<v Speaker 1>we could take from across Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

48
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:07.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't think any single country we'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to hold up as a model,</v>

49
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>but I think they're common practices</v>
<v Speaker 1>that take different forms that we could</v>

50
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>look to across Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

51
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:14.131
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

52
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not just Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

53
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>we really are the outlier among the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy countries in a wide range of</v>

54
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:19.674
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

55
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.790
<v Speaker 1>The World Bank I think is often played a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly pernicious role over the last few</v>

56
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.420
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

57
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.620
<v Speaker 1>billy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.650
<v Speaker 1>supporting a lot of bad projects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>development projects and make great</v>

59
00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:35.080
<v Speaker 1>example here is Chad building an oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>pipeline.</v>

60
00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:37.240
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone knew what the garment Chad was</v>

61
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:39.860
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and the world make bank made a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

62
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.120
<v Speaker 1>big point of insisting that they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have all these safeguards to</v>

63
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:46.210
<v Speaker 1>ensure that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money from the pipeline went to,</v>

64
00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:47.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helping the poor people in Chad,</v>

65
00:02:47.921 --> 00:02:49.180
<v Speaker 1>one of the poorest countries in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

66
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.670
<v Speaker 1>And Lo and behold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened was the money went to the</v>

67
00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.290
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used it to buy arms.</v>

68
00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:53.981
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:55.480
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just an example.</v>

70
00:02:55.481 --> 00:02:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've had things like that all over</v>

71
00:02:56.951 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've also promoted and a wide range</v>

72
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>of areas where I think it was often</v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate at one,</v>

73
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm most familiar with the social</v>
<v Speaker 1>security in Latin America where they've</v>

74
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>got an almost every country in Latin</v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

75
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Brazil is the big exception to either</v>
<v Speaker 1>wholly or partially privatized their</v>

76
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>social security system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And almost invariably it's led to very</v>

77
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>high costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor coverage rates,</v>

78
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>really not very good outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they've done that with water</v>

79
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.620
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

80
00:03:21.621 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>they very much promoted an agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which certainly serves a lot of</v>

81
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 1>corporate interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often has not served the people who</v>

82
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to serve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the poor of the world.</v>

83
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 1>So in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the World Bank's mission if you</v>

84
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>go into the building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it really is kind of remarkable</v>

85
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 1>because it's a very opulent building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

86
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 1>no one objects to people having nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>offices,</v>

87
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>but it's really quite opulent with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>big fountain,</v>

88
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>big atrium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

89
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up on the wall it says,</v>

90
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>our dream is a world free of poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

91
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.850
<v Speaker 1>it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

92
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing they did that and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no sense of irony to that.</v>

93
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.901
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyhow,</v>

94
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their mission is a very noble one.</v>

95
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see them having done very</v>

96
00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 1>much to advance it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

97
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.070
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
