<v Speaker 2>lightly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I hope that when I think about my</v>

4
00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:17.120
<v Speaker 2>contribution legacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the</v>

5
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 2>first thing is that my kids will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 2>was pretty good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

7
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.680
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and will quote me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

9
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.880
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

10
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your dad,</v>

11
00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:32.660
<v Speaker 2>always used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I remember some time when dad said,</v>

12
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be one piece.</v>

13
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.990
<v Speaker 2>I remember going to Rome the first time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and making a point of seeing keats's</v>

14
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.650
<v Speaker 2>grave and weeping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It keeps his grave.</v>

15
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:46.670
<v Speaker 2>And I did because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

16
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:47.504
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

17
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.350
<v Speaker 2>he craved and mortality and on his</v>
<v Speaker 2>tombstone is written here lies one whose</v>

18
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.890
<v Speaker 2>name was written water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you never know whether Kate's was,</v>

19
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually thought that or whether he</v>

20
00:00:58.431 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 2>was doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring that if by doing that,</v>

21
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:02.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of like taking an umbrella so it</v>

22
00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:04.060
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't rain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

23
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether he,</v>

24
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.400
<v Speaker 2>that was a protection or whether he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether,</v>

25
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.710
<v Speaker 2>whether it was just false modesty.</v>

26
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.480
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd like to think that in some of</v>

27
00:01:14.481 --> 00:01:19.481
<v Speaker 2>the work that I've done both in my own</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing and as the editor of Hbr,</v>

28
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.570
<v Speaker 2>that there will be a few things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have changed some organizations for the</v>

29
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:27.470
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

30
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.140
<v Speaker 2>when I was at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fortunately before coming to Hbr,</v>

31
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 2>I wrote two books about intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 2>capital and about the value of knowledge</v>

32
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:37.700
<v Speaker 2>and the importance of thinking of</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge in organizations and</v>

33
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 2>developing knowledge assets and</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing,</v>

34
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.500
<v Speaker 2>using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tapping into people's brains and</v>

35
00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:46.310
<v Speaker 2>creativity worth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those have had an influence I think</v>

36
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:49.070
<v Speaker 2>along with a lot of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may have contributed to that.</v>

37
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.590
<v Speaker 2>But I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that in that work and,</v>

38
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.260
<v Speaker 2>and in the work I've done at Hbr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll be some people who say,</v>

39
00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:58.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that article or that idea that,</v>

40
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.700
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

41
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.030
<v Speaker 2>that changed things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

42
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.460
<v Speaker 2>that gave people some stuff that made</v>
<v Speaker 2>some lives better.</v>

43
00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even ideally some organizations,</v>

44
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a change changed the practice of</v>

45
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 2>management in some permanent way so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we stop screwing things up quite as</v>

46
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:16.310
<v Speaker 2>often as we did.</v>
