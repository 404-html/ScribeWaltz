1
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.610
<v Speaker 1>With respect to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say that less than five</v>

2
00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:16.540
<v Speaker 1>percent of Alzheimer Diseases are</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic trust meter.</v>

3
00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:20.290
<v Speaker 1>So 95 percent are not genetically</v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitted.</v>

4
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

5
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are genetically</v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitted,</v>

6
00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:29.940
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to occur at earlier ages than</v>

7
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.480
<v Speaker 1>adult is not a general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more often people who have it</v>

8
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.610
<v Speaker 1>because of genetic reasons that a five</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the people population,</v>

9
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have it at the earlier ages,</v>

10
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's only five percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>or less than five percent,</v>

11
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>about five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That number.</v>

12
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not that in China there is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than America,</v>

13
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:58.580
<v Speaker 1>less than Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is more or less than here and</v>

14
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.590
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are a particular population</v>

15
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.750
<v Speaker 1>that in a tigger circumstances that</v>
<v Speaker 1>could lead to dementia.</v>

16
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.560
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>because of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>the habits of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.830
<v Speaker 1>the population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are small groups of people.</v>

20
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.610
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.890
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Pacific,</v>

22
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.090
<v Speaker 1>they were population.</v>

23
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.700
<v Speaker 1>They used to eat the brain of the dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

24
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>And then they were transferring disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which one of the symptoms of the disease</v>

25
00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:39.640
<v Speaker 1>was dementia and they were all</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing goodman's over there.</v>

26
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:44.641
<v Speaker 1>There was a higher incidence of dementia</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because of this habit of hitting</v>

27
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>the brain of the people that were that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore like an infectious</v>

28
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.300
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were transferring the disease for</v>

29
00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:58.780
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two and higher incidents of people</v>

30
00:01:58.781 --> 00:02:03.040
<v Speaker 1>affected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is once this was found in this</v>

31
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.100
<v Speaker 1>habits where it stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the incidents of disease became the</v>

32
00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:13.291
<v Speaker 1>same as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with in other populations</v>

33
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

34
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:24.201
<v Speaker 1>if you look at our society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is not a population of people or</v>

35
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is more affected by the loss of</v>

36
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:31.520
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a problem.</v>

37
00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:35.300
<v Speaker 1>And that heats with aging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So something related with the,</v>

38
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.120
<v Speaker 1>with aging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as we age,</v>

39
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>we get more memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more memory problem.</v>

40
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Obviously not all people are equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some one,</v>

41
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.930
<v Speaker 1>a better memory than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

42
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.020
<v Speaker 1>and we do not know why some people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a better memory than others.</v>

43
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we say that,</v>

44
00:02:57.421 --> 00:02:58.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

45
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

46
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free keep ourselves and our brand</v>

47
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 1>exercises just like a muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gen,</v>

48
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:15.661
<v Speaker 1>we tend to have memory problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less memory problems.</v>

49
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.810
<v Speaker 1>So it kind of protective the activity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental activity.</v>

50
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Even some people think even physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity,</v>

51
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 1>it could be protected against the memory</v>
<v Speaker 1>loss,</v>

52
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.850
<v Speaker 1>the loss of memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

53
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.040
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I have to say I'm obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are diseases which are associated.</v>

55
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.250
<v Speaker 1>The one of the most typical one is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's disease which are associated</v>

56
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.360
<v Speaker 1>with the loss of memory and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardass but are of less relevance and</v>

57
00:03:57.921 --> 00:04:02.921
<v Speaker 1>less</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the characteristic symptoms of our</v>

58
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.330
<v Speaker 1>symptom of Alzheimer's disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really whole market disease,</v>

59
00:04:09.331 --> 00:04:12.000
<v Speaker 1>is the loss of what we call short term</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>

60
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.960
<v Speaker 1>So that's how the disease starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

61
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.960
<v Speaker 1>It's people who can not remember what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just did,</v>

62
00:04:18.961 --> 00:04:22.910
<v Speaker 1>the justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very short term memory loss and that's</v>

63
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.770
<v Speaker 1>last for very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>

64
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.210
<v Speaker 1>And progressively the memory problem get</v>
<v Speaker 1>worse and worse.</v>

65
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and only at the late stage of Alzheimer</v>

66
00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:38.670
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also longterm memory is affected.</v>

67
00:04:38.671 --> 00:04:42.180
<v Speaker 1>But the major characteristic of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer disease,</v>

68
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.870
<v Speaker 1>which is a very widespread disease in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the population patient at old age is the</v>

69
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.420
<v Speaker 1>loss of short term memory.</v>
