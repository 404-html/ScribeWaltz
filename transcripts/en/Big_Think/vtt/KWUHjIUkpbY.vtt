00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.360
<v Speaker 1>If you need a little extra energy or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to pay really close attention to</v>

2
00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:15.210
<v Speaker 1>something today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what you should do.</v>

3
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>You should make a prediction about</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

4
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>It can be a prediction of how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>emails you'll get in the next hour,</v>

5
00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:25.290
<v Speaker 1>or it could be a prediction about who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to win the baseball game tonight.</v>

6
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>It could be a prediction of how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumping jacks can you do with 60</v>

7
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make a prediction and then just wait to</v>

8
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:38.391
<v Speaker 1>see if you were right or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time that you make a prediction,</v>

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Speaker 1>you get a little bump of dopamine in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reward pathways of your brain.</v>

10
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.840
<v Speaker 1>The reason why you get a little dopamine</v>
<v Speaker 1>bomb is that your brain is preparing</v>

11
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>itself to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

12
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>we often think of dopamine as the reward</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurochemical,</v>

13
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there's something we really want,</v>

14
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a cookie or a pat on the back.</v>

15
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>And we get this dopamine hit in</v>
<v Speaker 1>anticipation of it.</v>

16
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 1>So we think about it as being really</v>
<v Speaker 1>related to pleasure and,</v>

17
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.240
<v Speaker 1>and fun and satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reason why dopamine feels good</v>

18
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.180
<v Speaker 1>is that the brain is actually trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>trick us into learning or improving our</v>

19
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:21.990
<v Speaker 1>strategies for being successful or</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting what we want.</v>

20
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.920
<v Speaker 1>So dopamine is going to prime your brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pay closer attention,</v>

21
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 1>to process information more effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be more engaged with what's going on.</v>

22
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

23
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so just make a little prediction</v>

24
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll get the dopamine hit,</v>

25
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.460
<v Speaker 1>your brain will go into high gear and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could really use this in,</v>

26
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>in very strategic ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

27
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>if you're giving a presentation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask your audience at the beginning of</v>

28
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:50.010
<v Speaker 1>your presentation to make a prediction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be about your presentation,</v>

29
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>it could be about something in their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

30
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.690
<v Speaker 1>You've given them a dopamine hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're paying attention.</v>

31
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 1>They're going to actually learn more</v>
<v Speaker 1>from what you're about to say.</v>

32
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>So make a prediction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really easy way to get the</v>

33
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 1>benefits and the learning benefits</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically of a dopamine bump.</v>

34
00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:07.590
<v Speaker 1>You'll also just feel happier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is good too.</v>
