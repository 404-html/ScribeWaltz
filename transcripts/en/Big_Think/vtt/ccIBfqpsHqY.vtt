00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Arianna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to open up by talking a little</v>

2
00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:14.680
<v Speaker 1>bit about the introduction to your book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you write about this collapse that</v>

3
00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:18.280
<v Speaker 1>you suffered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really made you reevaluate your</v>

4
00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:19.690
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your priorities,</v>

5
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 1>and I'm curious how mindfulness came out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that because you write a lot about</v>

6
00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:26.680
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>

7
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.050
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could have very well,</v>

8
00:00:29.051 --> 00:00:30.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken a vacation,</v>

9
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.560
<v Speaker 1>gotten some sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then moved on.</v>

10
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Why did you decide to stop and focus on</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindfulness as well?</v>

11
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.140
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this collapse eight years ago when I</v>

12
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.020
<v Speaker 1>collapsed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally from burnout,</v>

13
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.730
<v Speaker 1>sleep deprivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exhaustion,</v>

14
00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>hit my head on my desk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broke my cheekbone and find myself</v>

15
00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>coming to in a pool of blood of my own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I that,</v>

16
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.710
<v Speaker 1>that moment really made me reevaluate a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of my life.</v>

17
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.790
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.580
<v Speaker 1>in the course of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had always been interested in</v>

19
00:01:03.581 --> 00:01:05.410
<v Speaker 1>mindfulness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in meditation.</v>

20
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.870
<v Speaker 1>My mother taught me to meditate when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was 13,</v>

21
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.730
<v Speaker 1>living in Athens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greece.</v>

22
00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>That was quite exceptional at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.200
<v Speaker 1>I went to India and comparative religion</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I went to college.</v>

24
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I've meditated on and off all my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've always been drawn to that aspect</v>

25
00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:28.501
<v Speaker 1>of life who had changed eight years ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I realized that I didn't want</v>

26
00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:33.790
<v Speaker 1>this to be sort of episodic</v>
<v Speaker 1>journeys,</v>

27
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.050
<v Speaker 1>but to integrate them into my life on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>daily basis.</v>

28
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.770
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started the science which is pretty</v>

29
00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:44.210
<v Speaker 1>incontrovertible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

30
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.310
<v Speaker 1>and then I became fascinated with how</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite all that we know scientifically,</v>

31
00:01:51.581 --> 00:01:55.510
<v Speaker 1>behaviorally how hard it is for us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>still change,</v>

32
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

33
00:01:56.761 --> 00:02:01.761
<v Speaker 1>and that's really a big part of thrives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That how can we move from knowing what</v>

34
00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:06.991
<v Speaker 1>is best for us to actually doing what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>best for us and to realize there are no</v>

35
00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:12.181
<v Speaker 1>trade offs between leading and effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>live with what you produce,</v>

36
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:15.580
<v Speaker 1>results and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get stuff done.</v>

37
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>And also being mindful and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and taking care of that deeper dimension</v>

38
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.910
<v Speaker 1>of ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we talk about mindfulness today,</v>

39
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you describe its main tenant?</v>

40
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.940
<v Speaker 1>So what do we mean when we say we need</v>
<v Speaker 1>our lives to be more mind?</v>

41
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I love actually what I'm John Kevin has</v>
<v Speaker 1>said about mindfulness,</v>

42
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.740
<v Speaker 1>which is that it's really heartfulness</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as mindfulness.</v>

43
00:02:41.741 --> 00:02:45.820
<v Speaker 1>It's really being fully present each</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment of our lives,</v>

44
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.290
<v Speaker 1>a mind and heart and body of cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what follows is that</v>

45
00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:56.680
<v Speaker 1>recommendation that thoughts are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come,</v>

46
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to do star Bar,</v>

47
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>but we don't really have to follow them</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever they go.</v>

48
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's where for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing and consciously inhaling and</v>

49
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>exhaling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

50
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.280
<v Speaker 1>is such an essential part of mindfulness</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I use my breath to return to</v>

51
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 1>that centered place in us and let the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts come and go instead of</v>

52
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.250
<v Speaker 1>following every thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of slavish Lee,</v>

53
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>wherever it wants to go.</v>

54
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is that there has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

55
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:35.851
<v Speaker 1>this avalanche of new scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>discoveries that have validated ancient</v>

56
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she lost her purse and spiritual</v>

57
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:44.731
<v Speaker 1>teachers have always known this things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now we have modern science</v>

58
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>validating them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

59
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:48.960
<v Speaker 1>some of the most important work is very</v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

60
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Davidson at the University of Wisconsin</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is actually used modern methods like</v>

61
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Mris and lasers on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the brains of Buddhist monks who've</v>

63
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:06.811
<v Speaker 1>meditated for years to see some</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible results on the brain itself,</v>

64
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on gamma waves that show how that,</v>

65
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:17.731
<v Speaker 1>the plasticity of the brain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary and we can actually affect</v>

66
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.600
<v Speaker 1>how our brain functions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

67
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.350
<v Speaker 1>my being more mindful and taking time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditate and doing all these things.</v>

68
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 1>In your book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you refer a lot to steve jobs.</v>

69
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:32.410
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of someone who really took</v>
<v Speaker 1>this to heart,</v>

70
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and managed to,</v>

71
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put,</v>

72
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.150
<v Speaker 1>put things like mindfulness ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other things that people normally linked</v>

73
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>to success and ended up succeeding more</v>
<v Speaker 1>so than almost anyone else.</v>

74
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.600
<v Speaker 1>In your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it possible to achieve that kind of</v>

75
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 1>success?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can call jobs a genius if you want.</v>

76
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without mindfulness,</v>

77
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.170
<v Speaker 1>is it actually an essential component or</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it something that you can take or</v>

78
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:00.004
<v Speaker 1>leave?</v>

79
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I think geniuses are so rare that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure there are many ways to be a genius</v>

80
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.730
<v Speaker 1>know by definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does not conform to a standard</v>

81
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 1>deviation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm talking about</v>

82
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:23.161
<v Speaker 1>the rest of us who are not certified</v>
<v Speaker 1>junior says what makes for a life that</v>

84
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 1>is both more meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

85
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more effective.</v>

86
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:36.670
<v Speaker 1>I like to use that word because we all</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be effective at whatever we are</v>

87
00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:41.671
<v Speaker 1>doing for the vast majority of people we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know for certain,</v>

88
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mindfulness and Hans has everything</v>

89
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.800
<v Speaker 1>they enhanced performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

90
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.770
<v Speaker 1>there is no trade off between being</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindful and being effective.</v>

91
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.310
<v Speaker 1>It also enhances our own experience of</v>
<v Speaker 1>life because if we just define live</v>

92
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>purely in terms of success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reduced to these two metrics of money</v>

93
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:10.790
<v Speaker 1>and power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're missing out on what for me is the</v>

94
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 1>essence of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you cannot really experience</v>

95
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:17.120
<v Speaker 1>without the third metric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like the third leg of the store</v>

96
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>in thrive.</v>

97
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 1>I define it as consisting of these four</v>
<v Speaker 1>pillars,</v>

98
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 1>well being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom,</v>

99
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 1>wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and giving.</v>

100
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what a complete life</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

101
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:34.061
<v Speaker 1>And very often we've seen people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>reach a level of success and then begin</v>

102
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:39.761
<v Speaker 1>to integrate a giving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our wonder by there it maybe too late to</v>

103
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:45.281
<v Speaker 1>integrate wellbeing because we now know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tall that are around health and</v>

104
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:52.301
<v Speaker 1>immune system take if we live in in ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are consistently stressful and</v>

105
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:56.270
<v Speaker 1>wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has to do with decision making.</v>

106
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've caught a lot of people in the book</v>

107
00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:02.930
<v Speaker 1>acknowledging like Bill Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who said that the most important</v>

108
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:07.700
<v Speaker 1>mistakes I made I made when I was tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the connection between exhaustion,</v>

109
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.240
<v Speaker 1>sleep deprivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. And bad decisions is huge.</v>
