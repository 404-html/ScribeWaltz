00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Aiden's</v>
<v Speaker 1>in California,</v>

2
00:00:06.351 --> 00:00:10.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm a musician and a songwriter and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>really would like to know what makes</v>

3
00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:13.220
<v Speaker 1>music so human and powerful in its</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

4
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5
00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:16.420
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

6
00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:20.320
<v Speaker 2>I know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why,</v>

7
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.260
<v Speaker 2>but it sure is deep within us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

8
00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:28.261
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I was in school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in psychology class talked about</v>

9
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.660
<v Speaker 2>dogs responding to octaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the doubling of the frequency.</v>

10
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 2>And so there may be something to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

11
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:40.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are natural residences that appeal</v>

12
00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:43.120
<v Speaker 2>to us that as something to do with our</v>
<v Speaker 2>voices.</v>

13
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.250
<v Speaker 2>But I have also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

14
00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:49.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an expert in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've been to China and people will</v>

15
00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:54.751
<v Speaker 2>listen to sort of western disco music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but other music like swing music,</v>

16
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

17
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.940
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't appeal to them if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like it.</v>

18
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 2>There's something about the traditions</v>
<v Speaker 2>that with tonal language speakers versus</v>

19
00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:11.110
<v Speaker 2>us that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't Jive,</v>

20
00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 2>doesn't fit in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then in Japan it's not a tonal</v>

21
00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:16.150
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also got something that sounds</v>

22
00:01:16.151 --> 00:01:17.260
<v Speaker 2>more like Chinese to me.</v>

23
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is deep within us and I will say,</v>

24
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:22.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to get to Carnegie Hall,</v>

25
00:01:22.691 --> 00:01:23.710
<v Speaker 2>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>practice,</v>

26
00:01:23.711 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 2>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will say scales are very important.</v>

27
00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Do Scales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's all based on.</v>

28
00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

29
00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:35.020
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to play the blues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at you with your guitar.</v>

30
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.130
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to play the blues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to get a couple of minor chords</v>

31
00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:40.660
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to have a major third and</v>

32
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 2>seventh or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not sure why,</v>

33
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's got to be just ultimately based</v>
<v Speaker 2>on trying to attract a mate that's got</v>

34
00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:53.260
<v Speaker 2>to be what's down in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>carry on it.</v>
