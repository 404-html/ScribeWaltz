1
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.230
<v Speaker 2>well having been part of a military</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the time of a draft and then</v>

3
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 2>having been part of the defense</v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment when the all volunteer</v>

4
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:23.150
<v Speaker 2>force was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was coming in,</v>

5
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 2>there's no question in my mind the AVF</v>
<v Speaker 2>is head and shoulders above a draft.</v>

6
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these young men and women are fantastic.</v>

7
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:34.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'd have been worthy of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them as a young officer there that good.</v>

8
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're on the sec just starting the</v>

9
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:39.480
<v Speaker 2>second generation of the all volunteer</v>
<v Speaker 2>force.</v>

10
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience and I don't know how it's</v>

11
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:48.381
<v Speaker 2>going to going to come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly having an all volunteer force is</v>

12
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that has kept public</v>
<v Speaker 2>scrutiny of the war,</v>

13
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

14
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat.</v>

15
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think having said that,</v>

16
00:00:57.401 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 2>that there is a place in our society for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of mandatory service,</v>

17
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:06.381
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily military service because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a good thing to give to the</v>

18
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 2>country and I think it's a good leveler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A people of all religions,</v>

19
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 2>races and creeds can come together and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrificed together and give back to</v>

20
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 2>this country for a year or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

21
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 2>I think that'd be a great thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't foresee a return to the</v>

22
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:25.941
<v Speaker 2>draft as being a desirable possible</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless we were faced with a major</v>

23
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.713
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe.</v>

24
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.061
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

25
00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:32.930
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I encourage them to do it.</v>

26
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.810
<v Speaker 2>I'd be very enthusiastic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

27
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:37.430
<v Speaker 2>as I say it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

28
00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:40.280
<v Speaker 2>the young men and women who go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find that they're part of something</v>

29
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:44.210
<v Speaker 2>bigger than themselves and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this makes them on the one hand</v>

30
00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:45.740
<v Speaker 2>feel that they're part of something</v>
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile,</v>

31
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.380
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

32
00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:51.630
<v Speaker 2>that we're all part of something larger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

33
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 2>and that when you see that you can do</v>
<v Speaker 2>your part within that context,</v>

34
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.770
<v Speaker 2>I think it makes you a better citizen</v>
<v Speaker 2>all around.</v>

35
00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:00.370
<v Speaker 2>I think it shapes you very well for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>future workforce.</v>
