00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Some of the most interesting studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>near death and out of body experiences</v>

2
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>were run by the air force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>As airplanes got faster and faster and</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster over the past 20 years,</v>

4
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pilots kept flying themselves into g</v>

5
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>lock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity induced loss of consciousness.</v>

6
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they kept crashing.</v>

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.060
<v Speaker 1>So a guy named James winner was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a guy kind of charged with solving</v>

8
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 1>this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he did is down in Texas,</v>

9
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:35.031
<v Speaker 1>he spun like a thousand pilots in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant centrifuge into g lock.</v>

10
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as he was doing it,</v>

11
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:42.681
<v Speaker 1>he noticed something interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She locked means you pass out and if</v>

12
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>you've experienced it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what actually happens is your vision</v>

13
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680
<v Speaker 1>forms into a tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like if you're,</v>

14
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 1>if you're watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like an old television set</v>

15
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>turning off where it goes down into one</v>
<v Speaker 1>point and then disappears.</v>

16
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it looks experientially a lot like</v>

17
00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>you're walking down a long dark tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of one of the classic near</v>

18
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Speaker 1>death experience.</v>

19
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>A phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he discovered along the way is that</v>

20
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.510
<v Speaker 1>as he started spitting people towards g</v>
<v Speaker 1>lock,</v>

21
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>kind of the longer he spun them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people started reporting out of body</v>

22
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>experiences and after they were out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their body,</v>

23
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:20.550
<v Speaker 1>if he kept spitting them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would turn into a near death</v>

24
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

25
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 1>So he's the person that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>air force is the person,</v>

26
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>the US Air Force discovered that outer</v>
<v Speaker 1>body experiences in near death</v>

27
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:32.510
<v Speaker 1>experiences are actually on the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>continuum there.</v>

28
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>They're part of the same chain of effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of it has to do with the right</v>

29
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>temporal lobe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's other things going on as well.</v>

30
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.450
<v Speaker 1>And there are of course certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>mysteries,</v>

31
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are unsolved things in near death</v>

32
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got lots and lots and lots of</v>

33
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:52.551
<v Speaker 1>research that shows people report things</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were supposedly dead that they</v>

34
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>should not have known about at all.</v>

35
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>So there are people who died on</v>
<v Speaker 1>operating tables,</v>

36
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 1>right in research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Studies came back,</v>

37
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>were brought back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had near death experiences,</v>

38
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>and while they were dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nurse would take their glasses off</v>

39
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:10.230
<v Speaker 1>and put it in a drawer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and later when everybody was running</v>

40
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>around looking around for their glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who was on the operating</v>

41
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 1>table at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the patient who was dead at the time</v>

42
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:17.491
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

43
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:20.050
<v Speaker 1>they're in the bottom drawer over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a Pimm's Bon Llama Lamo</v>

44
00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:21.510
<v Speaker 1>study that was actually done in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Netherlands.</v>

45
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>This is where that actually happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lots and lots of</v>

46
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>experiences like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So somewhere along the line,</v>

47
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.300
<v Speaker 1>information is getting through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.850
<v Speaker 1>We don't know that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's still the mystery.</v>

49
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of the other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we understand the biology behind it now.</v>
