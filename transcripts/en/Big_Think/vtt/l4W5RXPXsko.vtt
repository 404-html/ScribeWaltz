1
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>There's a proposal around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a lot of interest to called the</v>

2
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:14.151
<v Speaker 1>universal basic income where everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>is guaranteed at least a certain level</v>

3
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:19.300
<v Speaker 1>of income in the society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some free market economists.</v>

4
00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:23.310
<v Speaker 1>So like Milton Friedman talked about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative income tax,</v>

5
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:28.311
<v Speaker 1>which in effect has the same features of</v>
<v Speaker 1>guaranteeing a certain level of income</v>

6
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.860
<v Speaker 1>for everybody as a base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think from a human rights and decency</v>

7
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>standard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of sense to the idea that</v>

8
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>everybody in the society should be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to meet their basic needs.</v>

9
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.800
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand a sense if you give</v>

10
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:48.410
<v Speaker 1>someone a check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 1>whether they're trying not trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>

12
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>not working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's no effort,</v>

13
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>no conditionality involved at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we're going to get a lot of people</v>

14
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:03.771
<v Speaker 1>that are absolutely doing nothing on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>backs of those who are really working.</v>

15
00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>So the incentive issues are real.</v>

16
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Even if the sensitivity and decency</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues are also real.</v>

17
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>I think that one way to handle this as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit more rounded,</v>

18
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:22.761
<v Speaker 1>rather than seeing a universal basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>income as a check and a kind of an</v>

19
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:27.390
<v Speaker 1>unconditional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a check that's just handed out as</v>

20
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 1>income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the idea of social democracy as</v>

21
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>it's applied in real countries in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

22
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 1>in the Netherlands and Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway,</v>

23
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

24
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>the ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody has access to publicly</v>

25
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:46.761
<v Speaker 1>financed healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has access to quality publicly</v>

26
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.000
<v Speaker 1>financed education including college</v>
<v Speaker 1>tuition.</v>

27
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not a trillion dollars of crushing</v>
<v Speaker 1>student debt,</v>

28
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.700
<v Speaker 1>but tuition's paid for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has access to not only</v>

29
00:01:58.801 --> 00:02:02.400
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but paid vacation.</v>

30
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has access to quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>childcare so that moms can go to work</v>

31
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>knowing that their kids are in a healthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>nurturing environment.</v>

32
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has access to maternity</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves,</v>

33
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:19.941
<v Speaker 1>so the moms and also paternity leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dads can stay home with their kids for</v>

34
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>several months.</v>

35
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of decent where you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have all this wonderful technology,</v>

36
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:28.560
<v Speaker 1>this wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we live decently,</v>

37
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not miserably.</v>

38
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>If people want to market income beyond</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

39
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.560
<v Speaker 1>they've got to go work for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If of course they are disabled,</v>

40
00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>if for some reason can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's added social support,</v>

41
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's not cash in people's pockets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's decency,</v>

42
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>its public services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basic needs met.</v>

43
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.990
<v Speaker 1>I see it as basically living decent</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives in decent societies.</v>

44
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:55.410
<v Speaker 1>They have a very different spirit to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

45
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>There aren't a lot of super rich Wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>Street Hedge Fund,</v>

46
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>a misanthropes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll use the term advisedly because</v>

47
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I find a lot of people on Wall Street</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't give a damn about anybody else</v>

48
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 1>except they care about their money and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>find that really weird,</v>

49
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.200
<v Speaker 1>but you don't find that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea in northern Europe because it's a</v>

50
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.560
<v Speaker 1>really looked down upon a and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like it when people are money</v>

51
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>grubbing.</v>

52
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of shunned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the social ethos is different.</v>

53
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.210
<v Speaker 1>I remember once I was running to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>airport in Oslo and I fly business class</v>

54
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:44.971
<v Speaker 1>and I'm constantly moving around and on</v>
<v Speaker 1>trips relentlessly around the world and</v>

55
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:51.211
<v Speaker 1>I ran up and where's the business class?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Line a to board and the guy looked at me</v>

56
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>like I was crazy and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

57
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>you were boarding the Scandinavian way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get back in line.</v>

58
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>And I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

59
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

60
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's in line and let's all get on</v>

61
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a social spirit.</v>

62
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.350
<v Speaker 1>It's the idea that we'd like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd like wealth by the way.</v>

63
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>They're not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not people tearing their clothes</v>

64
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 1>and living in hair shirts and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

65
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not enjoying themselves.</v>

66
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:27.130
<v Speaker 1>They light their vacations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they liked their boats in the Stockholm</v>

67
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:30.140
<v Speaker 1>archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like six weeks on their island.</v>

68
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.990
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live beautifully,</v>

69
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want gazillions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

70
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to do it at the expense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of others.</v>

71
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Speaker 1>They want to do it as a society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

72
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:45.770
<v Speaker 1>if America could just get a little of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that back rather than a,</v>

73
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 1>a president who believes in killers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>losers sick.</v>

74
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 1>But that's what we got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is what's degrading American</v>

75
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:56.770
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just the technical issues,</v>

76
00:04:56.771 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 1>not just the rising inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this spirit that you're a winner or</v>

77
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:03.280
<v Speaker 1>you're a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a loser,</v>

78
00:05:03.281 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>get out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Ayn rand talking.</v>

79
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 1>It's ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

80
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 1>and we've had enough of it.</v>
