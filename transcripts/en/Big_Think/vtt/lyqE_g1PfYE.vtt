00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.810
<v Speaker 1>This is a major issue,</v>

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.770
<v Speaker 2>major ratio for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for us or,</v>

3
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 2>and I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 2>we have to move fast forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.080
<v Speaker 2>in developing new technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would decrease that dependence of</v>

6
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 2>a western societies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the world as a whole,</v>

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on oil and especially oil is coming from</v>

8
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:33.441
<v Speaker 2>regions that are so volatile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable and subject to influence of,</v>

9
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremist trends.</v>

10
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.960
<v Speaker 2>The more we invest in finding</v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative sources of energy,</v>

11
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more,</v>

12
00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:44.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

13
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.960
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

14
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.340
<v Speaker 2>encourage our scientists to focus on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this semester.</v>

15
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more responsible will be for,</v>

16
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:52.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for our children.</v>

17
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.253
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

18
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.520
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

19
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Speaker 2>now wearing my hat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:01.550
<v Speaker 2>as the ambassador of Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the areas where a,</v>

21
00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 2>I hope Israel in the United States</v>
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

22
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:04.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

23
00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:05.234
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cooperate.</v>

24
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.800
<v Speaker 2>We've done tremendously in so many areas</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are of critical importance sport to</v>

25
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:11.060
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Israel.</v>

26
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.620
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

27
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.360

<v Speaker 2>the United States obviously,</v>

28
00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:17.000
<v Speaker 2>but Israel to the best of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists,</v>

29
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.690
<v Speaker 2>a worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that we need to encourage</v>

30
00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:23.570
<v Speaker 2>them to sit together and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

31
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.190
<v Speaker 2>bring promise to the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

32
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:26.024
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

33
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.930
<v Speaker 2>our grandchildren will be less</v>
<v Speaker 2>dependence on,</v>

34
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.260
<v Speaker 2>on oil than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

35
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.153
<v Speaker 2>than we are.</v>

36
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
