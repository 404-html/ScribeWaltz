00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.080
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of my best friends are funny</v>

2
00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.010
<v Speaker 1>ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.873
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

5
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they are using maybe when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about women not being funny,</v>

6
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.760
<v Speaker 1>maybe in kind of not in the way they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young male,</v>

8
00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:30.620
<v Speaker 1>humorous used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's more in a more intelligent</v>

9
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:33.920
<v Speaker 1>way that women use comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all kinds of comedy.</v>

10
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:38.921
<v Speaker 1>There's will ferrell movies and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Larry David on curby enthusiasm one I</v>

11
00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>enjoy totally in one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't.</v>

12
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.810
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's the way you use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an article written in Vanity</v>

13
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at Vanity Fair and one of the</v>

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.690
<v Speaker 1>women aren't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

15
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>I think he was talking about the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>women use humor.</v>

16
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Men Use humor to get something out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship where women don't use</v>

17
00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.990
<v Speaker 1>it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the difference in every</v>

18
00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:03.650
<v Speaker 1>time I hear about women not being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think women are terrific.</v>

19
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I think they're equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody's equal in it.</v>

20
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are less women comedians around</v>

21
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:12.290
<v Speaker 1>than there men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say it's about 20 percent women</v>

22
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:13.370
<v Speaker 1>comedians compared to men.</v>

23
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I,</v>

24
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe because of the work that goes into</v>

25
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very company is very aggressive.</v>

26
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

27
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>You're out every night trying to write</v>
<v Speaker 1>material,</v>

28
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>perform material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

29
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's grueling and you have to have that</v>

30
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>kind of drive inside of you to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

31
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>to make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these,</v>

32
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>these comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians are on the road all the time</v>

33
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the easiest life and it's not</v>

34
00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>these life hanging around a clubs every</v>
<v Speaker 1>night also.</v>

35
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>So you really want it and be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 1>to get onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>for at least 10 years and doing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

38
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:58.881
<v Speaker 1>That's a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like Miss London,</v>

39
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.620
<v Speaker 1>La.</v>

42
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to leave anybody out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

43
00:02:08.681 --> 00:02:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.370
