1
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in an autistic family where</v>

2
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>everyone was doing something in one</v>
<v Speaker 1>field of the arts or another.</v>

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 12 years old when I did my</v>

4
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:17.274
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.100
<v Speaker 1>acting at the actor's studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>James De once said that,</v>

7
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:25.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason to become an actor is</v>

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>because you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>from a young age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that is a certain rush that you're</v>

11
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>going to need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to satisfy them to make you feel</v>

12
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>fulfilled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you shouldn't do it.</v>

14
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just too brutal of a business most</v>

15
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:42.200
<v Speaker 1>of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>so I think that at the ripe old age of</v>
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>

17
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>I figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda like this thing.</v>

19
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.020
<v Speaker 1>I like talking to these people.</v>

20
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's apples and oranges.</v>

21
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really beat movies.</v>

22
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fun Gig I made.</v>

23
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nice to have a trailer and makeup</v>

24
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>an entire army that's basically all</v>
<v Speaker 1>there for the same purpose,</v>

26
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>which is make the best film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>

27
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

28
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>when you're on an Oliver Stone said</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody brings their a game.</v>

29
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Everybody brings their a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a from the top to the bottom.</v>

30
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:16.260
<v Speaker 1>And in between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>in terms of theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:21.450
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way to really duplicate that</v>

33
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>rush you get when you take an audience</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is lot and right there in front of</v>

34
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:30.690
<v Speaker 1>you through the journey of a great play</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you go through these emotions so</v>

35
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>that they can experience them without</v>
<v Speaker 1>having to go through them themselves.</v>

36
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a certain kind of human compact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that obviously you lose as soon as</v>

37
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:38.880
<v Speaker 1>there's a screen and the camera there.</v>

38
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

39
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.870
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll always have theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think theater will always be a</v>

40
00:01:42.871 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>powerful force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 1>because we need that human touch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly as we spend more and more</v>

42
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 1>time with machines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phones,</v>

43
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we start to lose our humanity.</v>

44
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:53.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

45
00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:55.200
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the price of our technology may very</v>

46
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>well end up being or humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think you gotta have that balance.</v>

47
00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally I try to do one for one.</v>

48
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:04.670
<v Speaker 1>If I can do a movie into a play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a movie to apply,</v>

49
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while at the same time writing and being</v>

50
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:09.100
<v Speaker 1>in that cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

51
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>those two fields are very writing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>acting are almost diametrically opposed</v>

52
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 1>in terms of being an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in your interest to be in shape and</v>

53
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>to be healthy and to have a strong voice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to be flexible as a writer,</v>

54
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting in this position for</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours on end,</v>

55
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>you'd get up and you can put your</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder down.</v>

56
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:26.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a healthy existence,</v>

57
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:29.250
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's probably not healthy for the</v>

58
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>person that lives with you either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

59
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to do the best you can.</v>

60
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.001
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

61
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:38.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably most proud of,</v>

62
00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:39.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plays that I've written just because</v>

63
00:02:39.941 --> 00:02:41.140
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the playwright,</v>

64
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.801
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:43.540
<v Speaker 1>your God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to do everything.</v>

66
00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:45.820
<v Speaker 1>You don't make any money hardly at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

67
00:02:45.821 --> 00:02:48.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really get to kind of control the</v>

68
00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:51.190
<v Speaker 1>scene as a screenwriter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the towel boy in the whorehouse.</v>

69
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

70
00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:53.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're lucky if you're invited to said</v>

71
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like the,</v>

72
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:55.900
<v Speaker 1>here's the blueprint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

73
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

74
00:02:57.401 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been some debate as to,</v>

75
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>or not a film should be by the director,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the screenwriter or by both</v>

76
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.330
<v Speaker 1>screenwriter lost out on that is when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

77
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and theater,</v>

78
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

79
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.473
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

80
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud of all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>well most of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>theater acting that I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is to try to talk about a</v>

83
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>performance that will never be seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

84
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>That was only lived by the people there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like telling somebody about</v>

85
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 1>your dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:25.931
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

87
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>if they love you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

88
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>they'll listen and smile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't really get it.</v>

89
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there is a certain infinite quality</v>

90
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

91
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 1>to film that is nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do the work and,</v>

92
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always going to be there.</v>

93
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.981
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:03:40.981 --> 00:03:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved telling stories and as long as I</v>

95
00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:46.560
<v Speaker 1>can make my living doing that and in all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different mediums that I,</v>

96
00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:48.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have been lucky enough to,</v>

97
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.400
<v Speaker 1>that's enough for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

98
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.050
<v Speaker 1>really it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:55.080
<v Speaker 1>there's different scales of stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you would want to tell one</v>

100
00:03:55.081 --> 00:03:57.150
<v Speaker 1>that 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

101
00:03:57.151 --> 00:03:59.730
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 million people will want to see and</v>

102
00:03:59.731 --> 00:04:01.020
<v Speaker 1>hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you do one that,</v>

103
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>150 we'll want to see on one night.</v>

104
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're telling the right</v>

105
00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:07.970
<v Speaker 1>story for the right audience and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

106
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.000
<v Speaker 1>they're getting something out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially the same feeling to me.</v>

107
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's the economic necessity</v>

108
00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:16.410
<v Speaker 1>of paying your bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do you do that?</v>

109
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.500
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago when I started out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

110
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I was kind taught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was insane for trying to pursue</v>

111
00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:27.450
<v Speaker 1>multiple fields at once because in five</v>
<v Speaker 1>years everyone who just did one would</v>

112
00:04:27.451 --> 00:04:28.500
<v Speaker 1>have five times the resume.</v>

113
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I would if I was lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

114
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.870
<v Speaker 1>but I took that gamble because I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my gut told me it was the right thing to</v>

115
00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:35.400
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

116
00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:36.900
<v Speaker 1>as an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much downtime.</v>

117
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:38.790
<v Speaker 1>You want to fill it with something else</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

118
00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:39.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a writer,</v>

119
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:41.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you're doing a passion</v>

120
00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:42.690
<v Speaker 1>project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's a paid Gig,</v>

121
00:04:42.691 --> 00:04:45.600
<v Speaker 1>sometimes there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he can do a journalistic piece.</v>

122
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this point,</v>

123
00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:49.520
<v Speaker 1>I think the shift started about 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

124
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.230
<v Speaker 1>a lot of factors while I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever the reasons,</v>

125
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.370
<v Speaker 1>2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it felt as though the,</v>

126
00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.390
<v Speaker 1>the combination of distribution models</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to tighten and the publishing</v>

127
00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:03.790
<v Speaker 1>and film and music industry is having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution,</v>

128
00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:06.780
<v Speaker 1>has themselves to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to catch up and understand how this is</v>

129
00:05:06.781 --> 00:05:10.710
<v Speaker 1>going to work in the new millennium has</v>
<v Speaker 1>made it a lot easier to pursue</v>

130
00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:13.150
<v Speaker 1>multi-platform careers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

131
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.890
<v Speaker 1>it's much easier to hire one person who</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do three or four different things</v>

132
00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:20.370
<v Speaker 1>than one specialist in that field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

133
00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:23.700
<v Speaker 1>I think about the college graduating</v>
<v Speaker 1>classes in high school classes that are</v>

134
00:05:23.701 --> 00:05:26.250
<v Speaker 1>coming up now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in a unique position.</v>

135
00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:27.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're entering one of the toughest</v>

136
00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:29.700
<v Speaker 1>economies of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>

137
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>

138
00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:35.380
<v Speaker 1>if they're willing to work really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability they have to learn something</v>

139
00:05:35.381 --> 00:05:38.430
<v Speaker 1>and much faster than we ever did before</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there.</v>

140
00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:41.460
<v Speaker 1>And it's really a question of are you</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to put in the effort and go that</v>

141
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:43.860
<v Speaker 1>extra marks if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's actually more</v>

142
00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:44.790
<v Speaker 1>opportunities out there.</v>
