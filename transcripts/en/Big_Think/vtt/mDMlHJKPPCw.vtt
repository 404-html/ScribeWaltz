1
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Machine intelligence includes two main</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.330
<v Speaker 1>One is high performance computing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the chips you need to do the complex</v>

3
00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:19.130
<v Speaker 1>math required and then artificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence within artificial</v>

4
00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:21.740
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the breakthroughs are happening in</v>

5
00:00:21.741 --> 00:00:26.540
<v Speaker 1>the area of machine learning and machine</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning includes the ability for</v>

6
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.830
<v Speaker 1>computers to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn and act on their own.</v>

7
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.290
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of great examples</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout business government and the</v>

8
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:39.650
<v Speaker 1>nonprofit world as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

9
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.360
<v Speaker 1>in the u s government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine learning is completely changing</v>

10
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:49.361
<v Speaker 1>how census workers visit houses to</v>
<v Speaker 1>collect the census data.</v>

11
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.570
<v Speaker 1>These numerators in the past would just</v>
<v Speaker 1>use their own judgment on what routes to</v>

12
00:00:55.941 --> 00:01:00.941
<v Speaker 1>take and when to visit houses and of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course they often found people not home</v>

13
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.080
<v Speaker 1>and the upcoming 2020 descending hill</v>
<v Speaker 1>census machine learning will actually</v>

14
00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:11.081
<v Speaker 1>give them the best routes and the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>predicted times to find when people are</v>

15
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>going to be home.</v>

16
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.160
<v Speaker 1>When people ask me if machine</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence will affect them,</v>

17
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I turn the question back around and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine your life or your job</v>

18
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:25.820
<v Speaker 1>without the Internet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most people will say no.</v>

19
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 1>And I say that's how machine</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence will become for us.</v>

20
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.840
<v Speaker 1>It's already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.070
<v Speaker 1>involved in our personal lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Amazon recommendation</v>

22
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.100
<v Speaker 1>engines or Netflix recommendation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it will continue to spread not only</v>

23
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:48.731
<v Speaker 1>in our personal and entertainment lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also in our day to day work lives as</v>

24
00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:53.960
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One example is it departments in</v>

25
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:58.070
<v Speaker 1>corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many companies spend the majority of</v>

26
00:01:58.071 --> 00:02:01.430
<v Speaker 1>their it budget on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>operations,</v>

27
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.150
<v Speaker 1>operations and maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a huge budget line item.</v>

28
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Machine intelligence is now able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>perform most or all of those mundane</v>

29
00:02:11.991 --> 00:02:16.991
<v Speaker 1>routine activities that frees up an</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire skilled workforce to focus on</v>

30
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.450
<v Speaker 1>creativity and innovation beyond the</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs that they're doing today.</v>

31
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.060
<v Speaker 1>So machine intelligence is not about</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely removing the person from the</v>

32
00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:30.140
<v Speaker 1>equation equation.</v>

33
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.830
<v Speaker 1>It's about machines and humans working</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

34
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.690
<v Speaker 1>We never recommend that you completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>abandon your judgment as a leader.</v>

35
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Many times machine learning is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as leaders we need to recognize that</v>

36
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.010
<v Speaker 1>and know when to ask questions and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to adapt.</v>

37
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.730
<v Speaker 1>So judgment is still absolutely critical</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this equation.</v>

38
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.690
<v Speaker 1>An interesting example is automated</v>
<v Speaker 1>trucking company,</v>

39
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Otto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was formed by Google engineers and</v>

40
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>within 10 months bought by Uber for $680</v>
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

41
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would make a company worth $680</v>

42
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>million in 10 months?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

43
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.360
<v Speaker 1>auto developed a cab top device sells</v>
<v Speaker 1>for $30,000 and can fully automate any</v>

44
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.270
<v Speaker 1>18 wheeler truck built after 2013</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

45
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>they've already made their first</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivery using a self driving truck.</v>

46
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.140
<v Speaker 1>It was 50,000 cans of Budweiser beer</v>
<v Speaker 1>last year.</v>

47
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Right now the truck can't handle every</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

48
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>It's really great on the highways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has problems in bad weather and</v>

49
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 1>on city streets.</v>

50
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>So for now the drivers continue to ride</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the cab,</v>

51
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 1>but when they're on the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drivers free to conduct whatever</v>

52
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>activities they choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I love the story of a driver doing</v>

53
00:03:56.081 --> 00:04:00.440
<v Speaker 1>yoga while going down the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the driver takes over in</v>

54
00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 1>difficult situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no question that artificial</v>

55
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:08.590
<v Speaker 1>intelligence will replace certain types</v>
<v Speaker 1>of tasks.</v>

56
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.400
<v Speaker 1>There are tasks today that machines are</v>
<v Speaker 1>better at than people.</v>

57
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Tasks like organizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remembering,</v>

58
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 1>finding patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those kinds of tasks will be replaced</v>

59
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:25.120
<v Speaker 1>by machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people are still so much better at</v>

60
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.290
<v Speaker 1>creativity and framing problems and</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasoning.</v>

61
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>So what will happen is that machines</v>
<v Speaker 1>will replace the row,</v>

62
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 1>some of the rote tasks that people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing today.</v>

63
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.440
<v Speaker 1>And it's up to us then to figure out as</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders,</v>

64
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.590
<v Speaker 1>what do we do with that talent and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we take advantage of the opportunity</v>

65
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 1>that that gives us.</v>

66
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.880
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a matter of machines putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>people out of work across the board.</v>

67
00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.150
<v Speaker 1>What goes hand in hand with that are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>new businesses that it will create the</v>

68
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:05.731
<v Speaker 1>new industries that it might spawn and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole new set of demands that aren't,</v>

69
00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:11.040
<v Speaker 1>that don't exist today that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will be,</v>

70
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>be able to go into for a second or third</v>
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

71
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.820
<v Speaker 1>One example of this is the data science</v>
<v Speaker 1>bowl.</v>

72
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Every year we put on the data science</v>
<v Speaker 1>bowl with Kaggle and we choose a really</v>

73
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:31.831
<v Speaker 1>hard social good problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kaggle puts it out to its community of a</v>

74
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.200
<v Speaker 1>million data scientists around the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they saw they work as volunteers to</v>

75
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:42.541
<v Speaker 1>solve the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last year the challenge was around heart</v>

76
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:47.551
<v Speaker 1>health and this year it was around new</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways of predicting lung cancer and of</v>

77
00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 1>the top 10 winning teams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of them had no background in the</v>

78
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:55.750
<v Speaker 1>medical field whatsoever.</v>

79
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Prior to this competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were able to learn with the medical</v>

80
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 1>knowledge they needed through tutorials</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because they came at it from</v>

81
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 1>different angles and different</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives,</v>

82
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 1>they were able to make breakthroughs in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lung cancer challenge.</v>

83
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.210
<v Speaker 1>The top 10 algorithms will improve by</v>
<v Speaker 1>10% the accuracy of predicting lung</v>

84
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

85
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.430
<v Speaker 1>one of the winning teams has already</v>
<v Speaker 1>secured venture capital funding to turn</v>

86
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:30.911
<v Speaker 1>that algorithm into a new business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an example of a business that</v>

87
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.220
<v Speaker 1>didn't exist previously and is launched</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of machine intelligence.</v>

88
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.390
<v Speaker 1>As a society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to make sure we help folks whose</v>

89
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:46.391
<v Speaker 1>jobs will be taken over by ai because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there will certainly be tasks that are</v>

90
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:50.360
<v Speaker 1>no longer that no longer require a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person to do them.</v>

91
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.990
<v Speaker 1>They answer to that dilemma is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>retrain those folks into different</v>

92
00:06:56.271 --> 00:07:01.271
<v Speaker 1>skillsets that can be applied to the new</v>
<v Speaker 1>industries and the new companies and the</v>

93
00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:03.410
<v Speaker 1>new jobs that are created.</v>

94
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.680
<v Speaker 1>So the best policy position that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>take as a nation is to invest in</v>

95
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:14.171
<v Speaker 1>retraining those workers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't help to deny the problem or</v>

96
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.280
<v Speaker 1>to think that it's way out when it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>already happening today.</v>

97
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.490
<v Speaker 1>We need to be proactive about retraining</v>
<v Speaker 1>that workforce so that we don't have a</v>

98
00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 1>class of people left behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

99
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.160
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't apply only to blue collar</v>
<v Speaker 1>type jobs.</v>

100
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.830
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctors,</v>

101
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.400
<v Speaker 1>their jobs will be completely disrupted</v>
<v Speaker 1>and change,</v>

102
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:42.550
<v Speaker 1>will no longer rely on a doctor's</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge or experience to diagnose and</v>

103
00:07:43.491 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 1>treat diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of doctors would become</v>

104
00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:50.840
<v Speaker 1>interpreters of models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The legal profession will be disrupted</v>

105
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.130
<v Speaker 1>no longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we require people to do research</v>

106
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.880
<v Speaker 1>on precedents and caselaw machines will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to do that.</v>

107
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:03.650
<v Speaker 1>So it affects every walk of life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>every industry,</v>

108
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.970
<v Speaker 1>but we need to invest in the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are displaced so that we take full</v>

109
00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:12.050
<v Speaker 1>advantage of that talent to use toward</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater ends.</v>

110
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:17.500
<v Speaker 1>One thing I'd say about barriers is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone can learn machine intelligence.</v>

111
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Many people feel like this is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to major in in school,</v>

112
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 1>or they have to work at a tech company</v>
<v Speaker 1>to become an expert that's no longer</v>

113
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:30.950
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of the leaders that we interviewed</v>

114
00:08:30.951 --> 00:08:35.300
<v Speaker 1>for our book have no background in</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine intelligence whatsoever before</v>

115
00:08:35.301 --> 00:08:40.130
<v Speaker 1>they took on these projects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so anyone can and should learn about</v>
