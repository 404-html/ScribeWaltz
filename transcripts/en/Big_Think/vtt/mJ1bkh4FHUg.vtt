1
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.700
<v Speaker 1>For me at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really take anything for granted</v>

2
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>is the way that I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you see,</v>

3
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>you see multiple ways of living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see your,</v>

4
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>your express.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens here is that people</v>

5
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:22.050
<v Speaker 1>get so used to this idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>of America as a place where anything and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything should happen.</v>

7
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where as Americans,</v>

8
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:31.180
<v Speaker 1>I think we're a very entitled bunch or</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

9
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that having seen that,</v>

10
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 1>that's not the case around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're very aware of that.</v>

11
00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think everything here then takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a new meaning.</v>

12
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>It's one that's not to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

13
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.861
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Speaker 1>when you say something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can say,</v>

16
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>oh well you think you're better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else.</v>

17
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>That's not it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

18
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody's still falls into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

19
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.740
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that I'm just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>entitled,</v>

20
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I feel just as entitled and probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>behave just as entitled as the next</v>

21
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>American as the next person here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at the same time having the</v>

22
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>ability to step out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

23
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 1>having the ability to be in another</v>
<v Speaker 1>place and see how people perceive you as</v>

24
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 1>an American and then not just see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also actively participate in that</v>

25
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>perception of Americans really is a self</v>
<v Speaker 1>check.</v>

26
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:14.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a way of looking at your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your behavior as a member of this</v>

27
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>particular society or this particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

28
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think it leads to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me at least,</v>

29
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 1>I feel like my life has completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>enriched.</v>

30
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being Nigerian obviously are being a</v>

31
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Nigerian American also means that I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 1>black American,</v>

32
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>which is also another set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives.</v>

33
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously given the history that</v>
<v Speaker 1>black Americans have in this society,</v>

34
00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 1>it's different for me because I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:36.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my family doesn't go generations deep</v>

36
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still experience the same things</v>

37
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>and you still have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

38
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>that outlook and you still have that way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of seeing how things are put together in</v>

39
00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>this society.</v>

40
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:46.530
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

42
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:47.364
<v Speaker 1>being in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

43
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 1>in a weird way also not really being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>

44
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.130
<v Speaker 1>you're part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

45
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>of your black American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

46
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I am a black American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time it's a different</v>

47
00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:56.874
<v Speaker 1>version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>And it's a multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different version.</v>

49
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it allows,</v>

50
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I think having those different versions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being a black American allows</v>

51
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 1>multiple perspectives and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 1>different analysis of what being a black</v>
<v Speaker 1>American meetings.</v>

53
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>I think all too often the society has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>monolithic definition of what a black</v>

54
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 1>American is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think having,</v>

55
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a Nigerian man,</v>

56
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>American being black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being African adds to that definition,</v>

57
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>at least in my own case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

58
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:24.860
<v Speaker 1>And I think it helps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>in the largest sense if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 1>for all the people who are black</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans from this part of the country,</v>

61
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 1>from that part of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are going to be an American,</v>

62
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>if you're Nigerian American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're Caribbean American,</v>

63
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>to add nuanced and structure to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>definition of black American.</v>

64
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so allow people to see that it's not</v>

65
00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:44.610
<v Speaker 1>just one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just one culture,</v>

66
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:47.760
<v Speaker 1>that it's a multiplicity of cultures and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's important both for,</v>

67
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.240
<v Speaker 1>for the recognition of that set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people as full citizens and also for</v>

68
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

69
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>for the country as a whole.</v>
