1
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Because there is no mystery here and had</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked together at the end for 11 years</v>

2
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.720
<v Speaker 1>when you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting in the fall of 1956,</v>

3
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.860
<v Speaker 1>we spent three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four years traveling the country</v>

4
00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:27.200
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the two of us to every one of the</v>

5
00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:32.201
<v Speaker 1>50 states and you get to know somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then his way of thinking and his way</v>

6
00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:38.111
<v Speaker 1>of speaking pretty well when you do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>day after day in all 50 states for three</v>

7
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.980
<v Speaker 1>years or more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the ideas were,</v>

8
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:50.981
<v Speaker 1>his policies were his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the judgements and decisions were his.</v>

9
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.380
<v Speaker 1>And when a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.710
<v Speaker 1>express those decisions in the White</v>
<v Speaker 1>House,</v>

11
00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>it was not difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me having participated in the</v>

12
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:06.791
<v Speaker 1>meeting to go a few steps down the hall</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my office and try to reflect in words</v>

13
00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:13.781
<v Speaker 1>on paper the first draft of the decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to convey to the public.</v>

14
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to say that,</v>

15
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually submitted it to the</v>

16
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:21.170
<v Speaker 1>president's chief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic advisor.</v>

18
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 1>That was me and I submitted it to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents of senior policy advisor and</v>

19
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:33.100
<v Speaker 1>senior staff member.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that also is me.</v>

20
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.650
<v Speaker 1>So being the modest about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.920
<v Speaker 1>basically I only had to savannah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to John F Kennedy knowing that the</v>

22
00:01:43.101 --> 00:01:48.101
<v Speaker 1>policy expressed in the paper was his</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy and I wanted him to be</v>

23
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:52.430
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with the words and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed the,</v>

24
00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:56.240
<v Speaker 1>that paper or sometimes a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes a lot.</v>

25
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes he would reject an entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>paragraph.</v>

26
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.050
<v Speaker 1>If I liked it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might find a speech a couple of weeks</v>

27
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would try to sneak it back in.</v>

28
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes he would recognize what I did.</v>

29
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

30
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.920
<v Speaker 1>That sense of satisfaction and pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents were</v>

31
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>two dedicated Americans who brought me</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to try to change the country in the</v>

32
00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:30.350
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to make it a better place for all</v>

33
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:33.080
<v Speaker 1>mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was nobody.</v>

34
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:38.081
<v Speaker 1>I was elected to nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there I was able to help shape the</v>

35
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:45.431
<v Speaker 1>words and even sometimes the thoughts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leader of the free world.</v>

36
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.210
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.360
<v Speaker 1>do have him using the words on which I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had worked a wasn't of course of</v>

38
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.090
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction and pride.</v>
