00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.443
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.040
<v Speaker 2>It's usually Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>South African.</v>

3
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.750
<v Speaker 2>I've retained the accent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that must have some sort of</v>

4
00:00:13.751 --> 00:00:16.870
<v Speaker 2>deep psychological reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.270
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think more and more for,</v>

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.131
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people,</v>

7
00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:22.160
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

8
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.130
<v Speaker 2>the reality of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of life in a,</v>

9
00:00:24.131 --> 00:00:27.190
<v Speaker 2>in a globalized world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's less and less,</v>

10
00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:30.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm the exception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

11
00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:32.740
<v Speaker 2>you could complain about it endlessly</v>
<v Speaker 2>and say you have no home.</v>

12
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:35.980
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also this incredible privilege</v>

13
00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:38.530
<v Speaker 2>to move between countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

14
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I try and remind myself of that</v>

15
00:00:41.261 --> 00:00:42.280
<v Speaker 2>anytime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

16
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.580
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm about to fall into the trap of,</v>

17
00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:46.930
<v Speaker 2>of self pity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

18
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:49.240
<v Speaker 2>having family members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parents are now in Australia and my</v>

19
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.640
<v Speaker 2>sister's in London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in New York.</v>

20
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.540
<v Speaker 2>And it is a dilemma of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

21
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:58.541
<v Speaker 2>how does a family ever then find its way</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to one another after so long living</v>

22
00:00:59.171 --> 00:01:02.380
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the moment it's still feels more</v>

23
00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:03.214
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

24
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.760
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
