1
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I think the most important technologies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have are those that we've had</v>

2
00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:17.920
<v Speaker 1>for decades already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One small example of that would be oral</v>

3
00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:21.700
<v Speaker 1>rehydration therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a simple solution of sugar,</v>

4
00:00:21.701 --> 00:00:22.720
<v Speaker 1>salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and water,</v>

5
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.160
<v Speaker 1>which can save the lives of severely</v>
<v Speaker 1>dehydrated people,</v>

6
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.480
<v Speaker 1>people dehydrated by cholera or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>intestinal worms,</v>

7
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.250
<v Speaker 1>which has resulted in severe diarrhea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've actually seen kids who actually</v>

8
00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:38.200
<v Speaker 1>come back from death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

9
00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:42.670
<v Speaker 1>they're literally hours from dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You give them the simple solution in the</v>

10
00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:46.960
<v Speaker 1>right quantity of oral rehydration</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy and they're up running around</v>

11
00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:50.470
<v Speaker 1>playing soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why isn't that being used everywhere</v>

12
00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:53.470
<v Speaker 1>in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is that the management,</v>

13
00:00:53.471 --> 00:00:58.471
<v Speaker 1>the wherewithal and the overall a unity</v>
<v Speaker 1>of focus on public health does not</v>

14
00:01:00.611 --> 00:01:03.550
<v Speaker 1>currently exist in so many countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

15
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.920
<v Speaker 1>they might be trying more complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions,</v>

16
00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:08.240
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.980
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.960
<v Speaker 1>interventions such as intravenous drips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can't be administered in all</v>

19
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 1>resource poor settings.</v>

20
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.570
<v Speaker 1>So it's really a mixed perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's a lot to be said</v>

21
00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 1>for new Po,</v>
<v Speaker 1>portable Ekg,</v>

22
00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:24.250
<v Speaker 1>akgs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also electronic medical records.</v>

23
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.130
<v Speaker 1>But overall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think first we've got to figure out</v>

24
00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:31.270
<v Speaker 1>how do we roll out the technologies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a lot of practice with,</v>

25
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.050
<v Speaker 1>which we know are extremely effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are technologies like</v>

26
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 1>insecticide treated bed nets or</v>
<v Speaker 1>combination therapy for malaria or</v>

27
00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:45.511
<v Speaker 1>antiretroviral therapy for HIV aids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are all very basic interventions,</v>

28
00:01:46.571 --> 00:01:50.170
<v Speaker 1>which have been with us at least a</v>
<v Speaker 1>decade,</v>

29
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.480
<v Speaker 1>if not decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than that.</v>

30
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.440
<v Speaker 1>And yet they're not currently being</v>
<v Speaker 1>implemented across the board.</v>

31
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.510
<v Speaker 1>There's actually some new vaccines which</v>
<v Speaker 1>have just come to market and are</v>

32
00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:04.030
<v Speaker 1>starting to be used in developing</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

33
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:09.031
<v Speaker 1>including a vaccine for pneumonia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pneumococcal vaccine,</v>

34
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.230
<v Speaker 1>which we just piloted in Rwanda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to save 6,000 lives,</v>

35
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.870
<v Speaker 1>and it's just one shot in the arm that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids need,</v>

36
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>periodically,</v>

37
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.000
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to be good and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to end up saving more lives than</v>

38
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:23.950
<v Speaker 1>lots of more sophisticated intervention.</v>
