1
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.120
<v Speaker 1>I spent a lot of time looking at foreign</v>
<v Speaker 1>models.</v>

2
00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:17.260
<v Speaker 1>I actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaired this year,</v>

3
00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:21.430
<v Speaker 1>the health governors at the World</v>
<v Speaker 1>Economic Congress in Davos and I'm the</v>

4
00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:26.320
<v Speaker 1>current chair of the International</v>
<v Speaker 1>Federation of Health plans and health</v>

5
00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:28.150
<v Speaker 1>plans from 80 countries around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

6
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.760
<v Speaker 1>And so I meet all the time with health</v>
<v Speaker 1>plans from,</v>

7
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.930
<v Speaker 1>from those other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been looking hard to figure out</v>

8
00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:39.400
<v Speaker 1>which attributes of those plans would</v>
<v Speaker 1>fit in the US.</v>

9
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.450
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I've learned from</v>
<v Speaker 1>working with all those countries is that</v>

10
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.340
<v Speaker 1>every single one does it a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

11
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.300
<v Speaker 1>So the model in Germany looks a lot like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Netherlands,</v>

12
00:00:49.301 --> 00:00:52.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's not quite the same Austria</v>
<v Speaker 1>different than both those,</v>

13
00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:56.030
<v Speaker 1>but the quite similar fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The model had governor Schwarzenegger</v>

14
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 1>proposed in California last year looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspiciously like the Australian model,</v>

15
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that every country does it slightly</v>

16
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:08.200
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I were going to pick a model that</v>

17
00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

18
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.010
<v Speaker 1>would transplant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

19
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.630
<v Speaker 1>it's actually the Dutch model.</v>

20
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.810
<v Speaker 1>I think the Dutch have done some really</v>
<v Speaker 1>good things and the thing that they have</v>

21
00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:21.811
<v Speaker 1>added to their model more recently is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk adjuster between the health plan.</v>

22
00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:27.701
<v Speaker 1>So when the health plans go out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>recruit members and enroll people,</v>

23
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government in the end does a,</v>

24
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.180
<v Speaker 1>an assessment of who got the healthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who got the less healthy people</v>

25
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.060
<v Speaker 1>and if any health plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

26
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:37.840
<v Speaker 1>a disproportionate number of healthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

27
00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:39.760
<v Speaker 1>they have to actually pay some money</v>
<v Speaker 1>back into the pool.</v>

28
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.330
<v Speaker 1>And any health plan got too many sick</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

29
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.960
<v Speaker 1>They get more money from the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that does is strongly</v>

30
00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:48.700
<v Speaker 1>encouraged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we were saying earlier,</v>

31
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.840
<v Speaker 1>the health plans to go after the sicker</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and do a really good job taking</v>

32
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.330
<v Speaker 1>care of sick people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I know in the end they get</v>

33
00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:59.020
<v Speaker 1>arrested the adjuster from the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>plants that enrolled healthier people.</v>

34
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.240
<v Speaker 1>So I think the Dutch model of having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>payroll deduction,</v>

35
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.670
<v Speaker 1>individual choice of health plans and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the risk adjuster on the back end</v>

36
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.250
<v Speaker 1>has a lot to offer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a federal model.</v>

37
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.320
<v Speaker 1>They basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end of the year,</v>

38
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.020
<v Speaker 1>run the core information about each</v>
<v Speaker 1>health by how many diabetics do they</v>

39
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:21.310
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many congestive heart failure</v>

40
00:02:21.311 --> 00:02:23.170
<v Speaker 1>patients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many asthmatic.</v>

41
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 1>They sort through the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then basically when a formula and if</v>

42
00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:31.450
<v Speaker 1>you have enrolled a disproportionate</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of people with those expensive</v>

43
00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:36.451
<v Speaker 1>diseases in the high level of morbidity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they increase your payment or if it's a</v>

44
00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:43.000
<v Speaker 1>low level of decrease your payment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually we do that to some degree</v>

45
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:45.430
<v Speaker 1>in this country on our Medicare</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage program.</v>

46
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.450
<v Speaker 1>There's already we have a risk adjuster</v>
<v Speaker 1>formula that works in America.</v>

47
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty good formula.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not perfect,</v>

48
00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's a lot better than no formula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we.</v>

49
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.900
<v Speaker 1>We already have a history of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could.</v>

50
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>I could adapt to the Dutch model</v>

51
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.330
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
