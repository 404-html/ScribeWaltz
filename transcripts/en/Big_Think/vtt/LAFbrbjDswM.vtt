1
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.380
<v Speaker 1>War changes people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that we've known</v>

2
00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>since recorded history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.330
<v Speaker 1>it's been spoken about in literature</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the ages.</v>

4
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.960
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a brotherhood of combat</v>
<v Speaker 1>veterans.</v>

5
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.100
<v Speaker 1>And for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years it stayed in the Brotherhood</v>

6
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.940
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people came back from World</v>
<v Speaker 1>War Two.</v>

7
00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Our fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our grandfathers didn't talk about what</v>

8
00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:33.440
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.770
<v Speaker 1>because nobody would understand what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is that you're transformed inside.</v>

10
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.470
<v Speaker 1>You feel different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.830
<v Speaker 1>you've seen things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen death,</v>

12
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.230
<v Speaker 1>you've see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've experienced,</v>

13
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:51.920
<v Speaker 1>you've tasted fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done things that you don't want</v>

14
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:56.480
<v Speaker 1>to talk about or you feel shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about.</v>

15
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it'll be too scary for people to</v>

16
00:00:58.821 --> 00:00:59.654
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

17
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Ptsd is one of the most common mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>health conditions in the United States.</v>

18
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that map might be the fourth most common</v>

19
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 1>condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.590
<v Speaker 1>and that's because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.480
<v Speaker 1>trauma is so prevalent in our society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About 25% of women experience</v>

22
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal sexual violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is extraordinary.</v>

23
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 1>There are accidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural disasters,</v>

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than half of persons,</v>

25
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be exposed to at least one</v>

26
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>traumatic event in their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way that I like to describe a</v>

27
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>traumatic event is an event that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>divides your life into a before and</v>

28
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:50.330
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a watershed moment that really kind</v>

29
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:54.570
<v Speaker 1>of changes the way you view the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not you get post traumatic</v>

30
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>stress disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>it's big Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're leading your life a certain way,</v>

32
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:06.141
<v Speaker 1>something very big happens and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes the way that you look at</v>

33
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>yourself and you look at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those kind of events are certainly</v>

34
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:12.270
<v Speaker 1>transformative.</v>

35
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they certainly have long lasting marks</v>

36
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.350
<v Speaker 1>and one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

37
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.480
<v Speaker 1>effects of trauma exposure can be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>development of posttraumatic stress</v>

38
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you see danger everywhere and</v>

39
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>that you're really worried for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>safety that is going to affect almost</v>

40
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:36.861
<v Speaker 1>every interaction that you have at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be more on edge,</v>

41
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>more irritable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can get you into fights with</v>

42
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:45.021
<v Speaker 1>coworkers or with your employer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you can't really</v>

43
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:51.111
<v Speaker 1>experience pleasure or that you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>restricted range of emotions is going to</v>

44
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:54.140
<v Speaker 1>affect you mostly in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.180
<v Speaker 1>social and interpersonal domains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of marriages have been by PTSD.</v>

46
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spouse often really wants to help</v>

47
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>the affected person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're used to a certain closeness</v>

48
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>or intimacy that they find is now more</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to access.</v>

49
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.530
<v Speaker 1>The hallmark of ptsd is that the memory</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the event becomes haunting.</v>

50
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of takes on a life of its own.</v>

51
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.180
<v Speaker 1>You start thinking about what happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>just out of the blue or in response to</v>

52
00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:38.820
<v Speaker 1>triggers in the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's so distressing about the</v>

53
00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:43.500
<v Speaker 1>memory is not that you just have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>image or remember what happened.</v>

54
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.920
<v Speaker 1>You have the physiologic feeling of fear</v>
<v Speaker 1>or horror that you had when the event</v>

55
00:03:50.401 --> 00:03:55.401
<v Speaker 1>was occurring in real time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not only a,</v>

56
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.220
<v Speaker 1>a visual or or verbal memory out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a physiologic memory and this can</v>

57
00:04:03.181 --> 00:04:06.660
<v Speaker 1>happen while you're awake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can happen while you're asleep in the</v>

58
00:04:06.661 --> 00:04:10.020
<v Speaker 1>form of your dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that have ptsd have trouble</v>

59
00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:14.640
<v Speaker 1>experiencing pleasure and it's all about</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to become small and not,</v>

60
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.880
<v Speaker 1>not allowing yourself to be affected by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment.</v>

61
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also includes really changing the way</v>

62
00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:23.640
<v Speaker 1>you view the world and yourself.</v>

63
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.500
<v Speaker 1>The world's a bad place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

64
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.700
<v Speaker 1>you might feel guilty or worthless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might feel you're to blame for what</v>

65
00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:34.701
<v Speaker 1>happened or others are to blame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally there are symptoms that</v>

66
00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:39.771
<v Speaker 1>reflect increased arousal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people that have ptsd are on edge,</v>

67
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their body and brain chemistry is rigged</v>

68
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.480
<v Speaker 1>for danger and for experiencing threat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being very,</v>

69
00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:55.260
<v Speaker 1>very concerned about anything in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment that might threaten them.</v>

70
00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.800
<v Speaker 1>So the symptoms in this category include</v>
<v Speaker 1>being highly reactive to startle</v>

71
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.750
<v Speaker 1>responses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scanning the environment for signs</v>

72
00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:11.160
<v Speaker 1>of danger and not being able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on being very irritable and</v>

73
00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:11.994
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>

74
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's going to wave a magic wand and</v>

75
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:23.060
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to cure you being being anthro</v>

76
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 1>fairy dust on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting over.</v>

77
00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:30.781
<v Speaker 1>Ptsd is going to require some hard work</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the part of trauma survivor.</v>

78
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 1>And there's no getting around that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

79
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's work to look in the mirror and know</v>

80
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 1>that there's some part of you that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone forever.</v>

81
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.840
<v Speaker 1>There's work trying to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what has and hasn't changed and</v>

82
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>what can happen next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>PTSD treatment can be very,</v>

83
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>very successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen it do wonders for people.</v>

84
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:03.251
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people go from being extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>symptomatic to having very low symptoms</v>

85
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 1>for a very long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not something someone does to</v>

86
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:12.650
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not in a little pill box that you</v>

87
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:17.651
<v Speaker 1>just swallow with water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really involves confronting what has</v>

88
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:22.961
<v Speaker 1>happened and con and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we sometimes fill it so much easier to</v>

89
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 1>just try to put it in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to avoid it,</v>

90
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 1>try not to think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try not to deal with it.</v>

91
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.450
<v Speaker 1>But if we open ourselves up to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

92
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.910
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even the benefits or the ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can grow the opportunities</v>

93
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 1>provided to us by having these unique</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>

94
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can get past that hurdle.</v>
