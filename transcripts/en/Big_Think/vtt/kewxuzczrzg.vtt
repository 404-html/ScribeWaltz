<v Speaker 1>If you start out a side project aiming</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it needs to make money,</v>

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.470
<v Speaker 1>you will make decisions on a complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>different level.</v>

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>I think the beauty of a side project is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are so playful and experimental</v>

4
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>because you don't put the money</v>
<v Speaker 1>component on it.</v>

5
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>You don't put a layer of money on top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.470
<v Speaker 1>So I started my blog as my personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>visual archive of things I find online</v>

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>that interests me and inspire me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was completely meant just to be my</v>

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>personal archive and then slowly but</v>
<v Speaker 1>surely I realized because I started</v>

9
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>looking at my stats and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

10
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>this is not so personal anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And eventually I realized,</v>

11
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a growing community.</v>

12
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:40.410
<v Speaker 1>This is people coming back every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then with that,</v>

13
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you get companies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to you and asks you,</v>

14
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:44.641
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

15
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>can you put my product up here?</v>

16
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Hey can advertise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

17
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.120
<v Speaker 1>this was not meant to be a business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when all of a sudden the aspect of</v>

18
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:56.860
<v Speaker 1>money comes at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to really do some thinking and</v>

19
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.990
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I want that?</v>

20
00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:02.991
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I gonna hurt my credibility by</v>

21
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>putting ads on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the interesting thing was when</v>

22
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I was approached by Jim coudal and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>told me the concept of the deck network,</v>

23
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>it totally resonated with what I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to be.</v>

24
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deck network,</v>

25
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a teeny tiny ed that is on the top</v>

26
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:22.510
<v Speaker 1>left side of my blog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

27
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.680
<v Speaker 1>that rotates a second rss feed that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>rotates in and out and it believes in</v>

28
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:32.160
<v Speaker 1>the concept of you can only have ads</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are really catered to your</v>

29
00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to creative audience.</v>

30
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>So it's not noise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually irrelevant.</v>

31
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.520
<v Speaker 1>So I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

32
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could actually have advertising on my</v>

33
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>site that is actually valuable to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>readers because he points out maybe</v>

34
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:49.851
<v Speaker 1>tools they would love to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a way that you can add value</v>

35
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.220
<v Speaker 1>with advertising if you have a site or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that somebody wants to</v>

36
00:01:55.891 --> 00:02:00.891
<v Speaker 1>give you money for an exchange for</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyeballs just makes sure that it adds</v>

37
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:07.431
<v Speaker 1>value to whoever is reading your site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is something that you completely</v>

38
00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>stand behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will never ever write about something</v>

39
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.580
<v Speaker 1>if I don't love it and unfortunately</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's too many sites that debt just</v>

40
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.600
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

41
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>we have to bring the Bacon home so we</v>
<v Speaker 1>just got to take this advertising and I</v>

42
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:27.651
<v Speaker 1>think that's where you ruin it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you lose the trust of your</v>

43
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>readers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your audience,</v>

44
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.870
<v Speaker 1>and there is nothing that a value more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the trust of the people that come</v>

45
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:41.481
<v Speaker 1>back to my site everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your credibility is all you have and I</v>

46
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 1>think it doesn't have to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you run a blog or not,</v>

47
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.170
<v Speaker 1>it's in your day to day like don't lose</v>
<v Speaker 1>your credibility.</v>

48
00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Don't sell out.</v>
