00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.960
<v Speaker 1>David blaine's plan was to spend 44 days</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a see through plexiglass box dangling</v>

2
00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:18.260
<v Speaker 1>from a crane near London bridge</v>
<v Speaker 1>subsisting on nothing but water.</v>

3
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.640
<v Speaker 1>He called the endeavor above the below,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which some observers considered a bit</v>

4
00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British were not impressed.</v>

5
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.970
<v Speaker 1>They were not impressed when Blaine</v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounces venture at the most extreme</v>

6
00:00:28.971 --> 00:00:33.350
<v Speaker 1>exercise in isolation and physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>deprivation ever attempted or when he</v>

7
00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:35.210
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a great artist.</v>

8
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Nothing more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing less.</v>

9
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.860
<v Speaker 1>There were not impressed by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>multimillion pound deal.</v>

10
00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:43.910
<v Speaker 1>He struck with Sky Television and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were not impressed that he had decided</v>

11
00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>to confine himself to glass prison and</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily starve when so many people</v>

12
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:51.680
<v Speaker 1>were actually incarcerated in real</v>
<v Speaker 1>prisons and actually starving.</v>

13
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>The mayor of London said it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>disrespectful to the IRA members who</v>

14
00:00:55.641 --> 00:01:00.641
<v Speaker 1>died on hunger strikes in the 1980s</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blaine duly took his place in his box,</v>

15
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.750
<v Speaker 1>but the stunt totally backfired.</v>

16
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>This is if it were the 18th century and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blaine was in the stocks.</v>

17
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Crowns of cynical lenders gathered</v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath his box and laughed at him.</v>

18
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.970
<v Speaker 1>They pelted him with bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French fries and eggs.</v>

19
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.460
<v Speaker 1>They made such a mess and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend,</v>

20
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>the unusually named German model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manon van Gherkin,</v>

21
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 1>had to be cranked up on a crane to wash</v>
<v Speaker 1>the food to try this off the box with a</v>

22
00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 1>cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never had anything like this in New</v>

23
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.273
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

24
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Blaine's helpers raise the box so it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would not be within egg throwing</v>

25
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:34.700
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A group of men position themselves on</v>

26
00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:36.950
<v Speaker 1>tower bridge and tried to hit it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>golf balls.</v>

27
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.810
<v Speaker 1>A hamburger van pulled up below and</v>
<v Speaker 1>began ostentatiously frying onions and</v>

28
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:44.480
<v Speaker 1>other foods is enticing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aroma was designed to upset,</v>

29
00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:47.660
<v Speaker 1>blame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starving as he was a man tried to cut</v>

30
00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:51.080
<v Speaker 1>off as water supply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some youth frightened him by shining,</v>

31
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:52.670
<v Speaker 1>lasered bends into his eyes.</v>

32
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Speaker 1>A homeless person sat nearby behind a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sign saying,</v>

33
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.470
<v Speaker 1>please give generously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm attempting 44 days on continuous</v>

34
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>alcohol abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women took off their tops and flash</v>

35
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:07.280
<v Speaker 1>their breasts at Blaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men pull down their pants and mooned</v>

36
00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:09.350
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People stayed up all night playing the</v>

37
00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:13.150
<v Speaker 1>drums so this to disturb the tranquility</v>
<v Speaker 1>of anyone who might be trying to sleep</v>

38
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.480
<v Speaker 1>in an overhead box or radio station or</v>
<v Speaker 1>just listeners to stand in the cold</v>

39
00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:18.710
<v Speaker 1>chanting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ding,</v>

40
00:02:18.711 --> 00:02:19.491
<v Speaker 1>Ding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ding,</v>

41
00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:23.870
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm noxious fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone blasted the song living in a box</v>

42
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:26.510
<v Speaker 1>by the British pop funk group living in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a box,</v>

43
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.160
<v Speaker 1>a remote control helicopter buzz by</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangling a juicy looking cheeseburger on</v>

44
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:34.130
<v Speaker 1>a string.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was unpleasant speculation about</v>

45
00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Blaine's bathroom arrangements in</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping with Britain's wellknown</v>

46
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.300
<v Speaker 1>lavatory obsessions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blaine's explanation of his plans for</v>

47
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:45.260
<v Speaker 1>his liquid waste that it would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>expelled by a to bleeding out of the box</v>

48
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.390
<v Speaker 1>had left a solid waste situation.</v>

49
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Deliberately vague adult diapers were</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned or radio host took to calling</v>

50
00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Blaine nathey man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newspaper columnist speculated that the</v>

51
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>illusionist had been eating on the sly</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that they actually kind of fat</v>

52
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>considering in the Sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jane were referred to him.</v>

53
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Is that total twerp currently dangling</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a glass box above the Thames in the</v>

54
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Guardian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catherine Bennett said that the</v>

55
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>satirical response to Blaine illustrated</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temperamental gulf between Britain</v>

56
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>and America because Britain's know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell the difference between a</v>

57
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>huckster and a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She urge Londoners to engage in a mass</v>

58
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>public ridicule by taunting blend with</v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

59
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 1>even a blob of oily ice cream tastes</v>
<v Speaker 1>wizard when consumed in this suspended</v>

60
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:30.380
<v Speaker 1>company of the posture as close starving</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blaine,</v>

61
00:03:30.381 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

62
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>He did have a supporters including</v>
<v Speaker 1>American tourists,</v>

63
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>regular visitors who believed they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>telepathic communication with him and</v>

64
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>that he was sending them special signals</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the box.</v>

65
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 1>People who felt sorry for him and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>parent normalist Uri Geller,</v>

66
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:48.530
<v Speaker 1>who announced he is the quality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>respite.</v>

67
00:03:48.531 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>And when Blaine finally came down thin</v>
<v Speaker 1>and weak and with his major organs on</v>

68
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 1>the verge of collapse or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said the general feeling was that</v>

69
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 1>above the below had been beyond the</v>
<v Speaker 1>absurd,</v>

70
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 1>a huge pretentious failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what was it that made ordinary</v>

71
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Britain's teas and resent him so much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he was making such a big deal</v>

72
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>about it because he had revealed himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a puffed up self promoter rather</v>

73
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>than the friendly kind of eccentric who</v>
<v Speaker 1>does what he does for himself rather</v>

74
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 1>than for public acclaim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>news capable of going to the pub and</v>

75
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>laughing at himself over a few pints</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he did not know when enough was</v>

76
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:21.100
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
