1
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Bipolar disorder can have lots of effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a person's day to day functioning.</v>

2
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for instance,</v>

3
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>again in the middle of an episode of</v>
<v Speaker 1>either mania or depression,</v>

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are manic will often do</v>

5
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>things that are really impulsive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>really out of character.</v>

6
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>And so issues of infidelity can come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

7
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>in a patient with media who's having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual partner or sexual partners</v>

8
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>outside of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship in the midst of a manic</v>

9
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will often spend money that they</v>

10
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>really can't afford to spend in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>midst of a manic episode,</v>

11
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 1>which you can imagine will cause a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of strain for them personally.</v>

12
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.890
<v Speaker 1>But also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>in the context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the context of their families,</v>

14
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.580
<v Speaker 1>people in the midst of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.660
<v Speaker 1>mania often don't appear to be logical</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they will go to work and we'll</v>

16
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>have lots of irritability.</v>

17
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>And you can imagine again that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coworkers are confused,</v>

18
00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>bosses are confused and especially if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand a lot about the</v>

19
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>illness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can affect their work relationships</v>

20
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 1>and their ability to maintain their</v>
<v Speaker 1>employment.</v>

21
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine that if it's hard to get</v>

22
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:10.770
<v Speaker 1>up out of bed and even go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>supermarket and get your groceries for</v>

23
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it can be very difficult to go to</v>

24
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:13.734
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.310
<v Speaker 1>and get all the things that you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get done either in your work life or</v>

26
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in your personal life.</v>

27
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.340
<v Speaker 1>People were port guilt or sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling like they're worthless.</v>

28
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will also report that they feel</v>

29
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>like they're either kind of moving in</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow motion,</v>

30
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.770
<v Speaker 1>which is known as psychomotor</v>
<v Speaker 1>retardation and occasionally people will</v>

31
00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:35.100
<v Speaker 1>report that they actually feel jittery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is known as psychomotor agitation.</v>

32
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in addition,</v>

33
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>people report disturbances in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

34
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:40.540
<v Speaker 1>What's your most commonly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>insomnia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So either difficulty falling asleep,</v>

36
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.590
<v Speaker 1>waking up in the middle of the night or</v>
<v Speaker 1>waking up earlier in the morning.</v>

37
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Then one intends to occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this can be hypersomnia though where</v>

38
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>people are sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

39
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:52.891
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>

40
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:55.050
<v Speaker 1>13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 or more hours per day.</v>

41
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Patients with bipolar disorder often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.900
<v Speaker 1>are resistant to receiving treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially during a manic episode.</v>

43
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.370
<v Speaker 1>And this is really part of the illness</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of not understanding that one</v>

44
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:13.400
<v Speaker 1>is sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bipolar disorder cannot be cured.</v>

45
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.160
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will often find that they will go</v>

46
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.791
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:20.810
<v Speaker 1>periods of time without having any</v>
<v Speaker 1>illness or periods of euthymia.</v>

48
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Speaker 1>It really depends on the individual and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how their clinical course goes,</v>

49
00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:29.090
<v Speaker 1>as well as finding treatments that work</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mainstay of treatments or mood</v>

50
00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:30.740
<v Speaker 1>stabilizers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are moods,</v>

51
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.330
<v Speaker 1>medications that are used to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody from having most notably,</v>

52
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.890
<v Speaker 1>a manic episode or a depressive episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finding the right treatment can</v>

54
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:41.990
<v Speaker 1>sometimes be a little frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

55
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.110
<v Speaker 1>and patients really need to hang in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there as their doctors tried different</v>

56
00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:49.760
<v Speaker 1>medications to figure out what works</v>
<v Speaker 1>best with their neurobiology in order to</v>

57
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.600
<v Speaker 1>support a loved one who has bipolar</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>

58
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 1>it's really important to realize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an like any other illness.</v>

59
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times people will think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental illnesses as being something</v>

60
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 1>that's within the control of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

61
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>And the individual will often think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

62
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>feeling tremendous guilt when they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>have episodes of either mania or</v>

63
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the first thing is realizing</v>

64
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:16.100
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

65
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>people don't choose to have bipolar</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder and they would definitely</v>

66
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:20.780
<v Speaker 1>choose that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>live with more mental wellness than</v>
<v Speaker 1>having this illness.</v>

68
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really important to be calm,</v>

69
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>present and consistent with people with</v>
<v Speaker 1>bipolar disorder as well as supporting</v>

70
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 1>them and maintaining their treatment in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next 10,</v>

71
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

72
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really see a lot more research being</v>

73
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>done to try to find treatments that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective and have less side effects</v>

74
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 1>than some of the medications that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have currently available today.</v>

75
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I really only see better things for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
