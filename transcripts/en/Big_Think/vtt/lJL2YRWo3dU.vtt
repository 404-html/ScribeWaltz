<v Speaker 1>Health care is hugely inefficient</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry Mckinsey analyze the American</v>

2
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:20.681
<v Speaker 1>healthcare system versus healthcare</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems in the other country and it came</v>

3
00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>up with a figure that there is about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>half a trillion dollars of.</v>

4
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.980
<v Speaker 1>I would put it waste in the US</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare system.</v>

5
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.700
<v Speaker 1>The biggest source of waste is the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>we treat people with chronic diseases.</v>

6
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Diseases like diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>AIDS,</v>

7
00:00:40.071 --> 00:00:41.960
<v Speaker 1>heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.550
<v Speaker 1>people who have chronic disabilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>like bad backs,</v>

9
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.180
<v Speaker 1>and we treat them in a very fragmented</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

10
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.870
<v Speaker 1>We have no one organization that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for everything that the</v>

11
00:00:56.511 --> 00:01:01.370
<v Speaker 1>person with diabetes has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that the person with AIDS</v>

12
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs.</v>

13
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 1>People have tremendously complicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs there in diseases core</v>

14
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.750
<v Speaker 1>multifactorial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they manifest themselves in many</v>

15
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:15.200
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we need as a healthcare system</v>

16
00:01:15.201 --> 00:01:20.201
<v Speaker 1>that's organized around the needs of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>patient for total care for their</v>

17
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:23.930
<v Speaker 1>diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>total care for their disability.</v>

18
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.310
<v Speaker 1>What we have as a healthcare system</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's organized by inputs,</v>

19
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.900
<v Speaker 1>doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitals,</v>

20
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:33.350
<v Speaker 1>nursing homes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each one of these inputs,</v>

21
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.350
<v Speaker 1>each one of these providers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did they want?</v>

22
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hilman.</v>

23
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>What they want is they want to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they met summize,</v>

24
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:47.121
<v Speaker 1>their share of their pie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maximizing their share of the pie is not</v>

25
00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:50.150
<v Speaker 1>the same as doing what's best for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>patient.</v>
