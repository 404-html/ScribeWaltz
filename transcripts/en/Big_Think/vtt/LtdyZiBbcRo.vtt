1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>The way it's worked into my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity and making movies and</v>

2
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:10.281
<v Speaker 1>television shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's enabled me to be a better curator</v>

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.630
<v Speaker 1>of what's an original idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think our first reflex is to go to the</v>

4
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Internet as opposed to seeking out new</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to meet because that's really a</v>

5
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>disrupting your comfort zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:30.430
<v Speaker 1>every time I do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.510
<v Speaker 1>it's challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that isn't going to be your</v>

8
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 1>natural reflex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your natural reflex is going to go to</v>

9
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:38.550
<v Speaker 1>google a subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google the person,</v>

10
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet I am Deb,</v>

11
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>and that isn't how it's going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you want to do is you want to</v>

12
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>try to figure out how extraordinary</v>
<v Speaker 1>people become extraordinary.</v>

13
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Do I think kids normally just go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet and just stop there?</v>

14
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Probably because you are getting out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your comfort zone.</v>

15
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Meeting a new person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you treat it as an act of generosity</v>

16
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>that you are wanting to share part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life with somebody,</v>

17
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.020
<v Speaker 1>it will reduce your anxiety.</v>

18
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.940
<v Speaker 1>When you reach out to somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go beyond just asking you a</v>

19
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:17.850
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might give them a piece of</v>

20
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I've met some famous designers</v>

21
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:26.091
<v Speaker 1>like Vivienne Westwood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come to Vivienne Westwood immediately</v>

22
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>with an olive branch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I immediately say to Vivienne Westwood,</v>

23
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.450
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of this new</v>
<v Speaker 1>soundtrack?</v>

24
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Or what do you think of this piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>music?</v>

25
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Because look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>designing it goes hand in hand with</v>

26
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:39.361
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music is going to be some compatibility</v>

28
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 1>to fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately what I'm trying to do is find</v>

29
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:51.891
<v Speaker 1>a way to intersect with how their psyche</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually works.</v>

30
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.560
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm trying to do is understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly what is it that they are</v>

31
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:03.021
<v Speaker 1>going through emotionally because</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally what they're going through</v>

32
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.400
<v Speaker 1>is going to relate to what they do and</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve professionally.</v>

33
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>And what's deeper than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

34
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 1>is what do they think is their purpose</v>
<v Speaker 1>in life?</v>

35
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>What is valuable to them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>what has meaning in their life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made it probably the deep truth of,</v>

37
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.730
<v Speaker 1>of what we're trying to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>within our solar system as human beings</v>

38
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>and even as we try to get outside of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>solar system.</v>

39
00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 1>What is this all about?</v>
