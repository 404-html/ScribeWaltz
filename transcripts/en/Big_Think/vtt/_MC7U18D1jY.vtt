00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.043
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>so why should someone who's in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business of getting someone's attention,</v>

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.120
<v Speaker 1>why should somebody who runs a business</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all about getting attention?</v>

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Why should they switch to being in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business of helping people?</v>

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for one,</v>

6
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be hard to do that until</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumers actually demand that that's</v>

7
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all need to recognize this as</v>

8
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>citizens of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just being human,</v>

9
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 1>that this world that's constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting to grab our attention doesn't</v>

10
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:33.110
<v Speaker 1>serve any of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

11
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>it's polluting our inner and our social</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

12
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>And once we recognize that that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want that as consumers that</v>

13
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>will enable businesses to follow</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumer demand and say we want to</v>

14
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>provide something whose goals are</v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely in alignment with your goals,</v>

15
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>where we measure our success in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the net positive benefits that we</v>

16
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 1>delivered in people's lives and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>charged more like a subscription model</v>

17
00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>or a payment model rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising where we have an infinite</v>

18
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 1>appetite in stealing as much of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention as possible.</v>

19
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we check our phones 150 times a</v>

20
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the average,</v>

21
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.200
<v Speaker 1>are those 150 conscious moments where</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're sitting here and then we think and</v>

22
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>then we choose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to check my phone or does</v>

23
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>it just happen to us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think one thing that that we don't</v>

24
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>talk about with the attention economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's different about the attention</v>

25
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 1>economy versus a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a normal marketing product,</v>

26
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:35.811
<v Speaker 1>goods economy is that in the regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy people make a conscious choice</v>

27
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>theoretically about the products that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they choose to buy or the places I</v>

28
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>choose to go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think get into a car and go there.</v>

29
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.780
<v Speaker 1>In the attention economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't choose where my intention goes.</v>

30
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>I choose kind of in the moments in</v>
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>

31
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.690
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of my intention can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>steered.</v>

32
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>This is what magicians do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

33
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>they do a trick by steering your</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention by focusing your attention</v>

34
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:01.614
<v Speaker 1>over here.</v>

35
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 1>And so what's different about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention economy is we have less choice</v>

36
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:09.660
<v Speaker 1>about where our attention goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be steered and manipulated much</v>

37
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>more easily than the conscious choice</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying economy when I'm choosing to buy</v>

38
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>a good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

39
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.330
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why are we checking our phones 150</v>

40
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:20.470
<v Speaker 1>times a day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this so compelling?</v>

41
00:02:20.471 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because at any given moment in life</v>

42
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm left with the uncomfort of</v>

43
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>being with myself where reality gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a little bit boring for just a</v>

44
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have just a break,</v>

45
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you walk into a cafe and there's a line</v>

46
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>before you order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we do?</v>

47
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Why do we pull out our phone in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment in a world where this has</v>

48
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:41.420
<v Speaker 1>increasingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.500
<v Speaker 1>gives you access to anything that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want at any given moment or the ability</v>

50
00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>to get back to those 10 emails or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to watch that video you've been</v>

51
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:51.204
<v Speaker 1>meaning to watch.</v>

52
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Why would you not turn to your phone in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that free moment?</v>

53
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>So we have to reckon with a world in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which next door to my current to moment</v>

54
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>experience of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this immediately sweeter,</v>

55
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>better choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that's true for every human being</v>

56
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>walking around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just put a better choice on life's</v>

57
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:12.900
<v Speaker 1>menu in your pocket that at any moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can switch to suddenly the world is</v>

58
00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 1>gonna look a lot like it does today</v>
<v Speaker 1>where everyone is down on their phones.</v>

59
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the point isn't that suddenly</v>

60
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.870
<v Speaker 1>we're just distracted or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

61
00:03:21.871 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>that we have to really get intimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

62
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Why is this happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's happening is because</v>

63
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:32.221
<v Speaker 1>it's more compelling than simply being</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the discomfort of reality as it is,</v>

64
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 1>which is going to force us to ask some</v>
<v Speaker 1>really deep questions with,</v>

65
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 1>with ourselves of if we were to not live</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>

66
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>if we were to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>not looking at our phone in a free</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment in time,</v>

68
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>would we be willing to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes being a little bit</v>

69
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable or being a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>bored?</v>

70
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when we make that choice,</v>

71
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>we don't just make that alone because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:03:56.321 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>imagine that person who meditates in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and suddenly says,</v>

73
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:01.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

74
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to look at my phone today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>

75
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they land in that line in the cafe and</v>

76
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 1>they don't look at their phone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of looking around smiling,</v>

77
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 1>but suddenly everyone around them is</v>
<v Speaker 1>still on their phone.</v>

78
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.780
<v Speaker 1>And what real realize realizes is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like a weekend isn't just</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us,</v>

80
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:20.200
<v Speaker 1>it's about being in a weekend together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't look at our phone,</v>

81
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>we don't just want to not look at our</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone by ourselves.</v>

82
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>We'd want to actually be able to connect</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and more connecting with other</v>

83
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:29.050
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes realities as sweet actually as</v>

84
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.800
<v Speaker 1>the things that our phone provides</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the whole point is like when,</v>

85
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 1>when you're in connection with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>else in your,</v>

86
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 1>that actually is more compelling than</v>
<v Speaker 1>being with our phones.</v>

87
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.550
<v Speaker 1>But when you're just by yourself sorting</v>
<v Speaker 1>for what's going to be the most</v>

88
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 1>stimulating or productive or</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertaining way for me to be right now,</v>

89
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.480
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes our phone will beat out other</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices that are appearing before us.</v>

90
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's only when we're with other</v>

91
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

92
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 1>and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in connection or conversation with</v>

93
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 1>someone else that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually is better than often.</v>

94
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these individual choices we can get on a</v>

95
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>phone because we actually do desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>

96
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't.</v>
