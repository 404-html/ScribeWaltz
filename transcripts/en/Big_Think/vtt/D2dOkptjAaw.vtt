00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.970
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being at the bank,</v>

2
00:00:09.971 --> 00:00:13.360
<v Speaker 1>you're in an outpost where you see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet more clearly,</v>

3
00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:18.310
<v Speaker 1>I think than in many other jobs almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the design of the institution</v>

4
00:00:18.311 --> 00:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>and the nature of what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And having been around,</v>

5
00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:24.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years at the high level,</v>

6
00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:28.360
<v Speaker 1>I had I think more of a broad view than</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people have.</v>

7
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>And when I was the European vice</v>
<v Speaker 1>president with Wolfenson,</v>

8
00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:37.171
<v Speaker 1>we went all over the prime ministers in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ministers and the g aids and the,</v>

9
00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:41.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>European summits and so forth.</v>

10
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>And at some point I had this feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I then wrote about that in a way.</v>

11
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no pilot in the cockpit on</v>

12
00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:58.771
<v Speaker 1>many global issues that they were these</v>
<v Speaker 1>un summits and this ga declarations and</v>

13
00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:02.680
<v Speaker 1>so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that in true fact,</v>

14
00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:07.450
<v Speaker 1>many of the big global problems like</v>
<v Speaker 1>global warming being one where not being</v>

15
00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:10.300
<v Speaker 1>actively solved by the international</v>
<v Speaker 1>system as we know it.</v>

16
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.090
<v Speaker 1>And so one day I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did something I did every year,</v>

17
00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 1>which was to take a week off to write a</v>
<v Speaker 1>major speech.</v>

18
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>I sat down and wrote a speech about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>question of why they were some two dozen</v>

19
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:30.961
<v Speaker 1>issues that were not being solved deeply</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and fast enough and why that was</v>

20
00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:36.130
<v Speaker 1>and what we could do to accelerate this</v>
<v Speaker 1>global problem solving that seems to be</v>

21
00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:41.131
<v Speaker 1>so slow to come by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that speech worked out fine.</v>

22
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.370
<v Speaker 1>And then there was an extraordinary</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment where,</v>

23
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chancellor Schroder who was then</v>

24
00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:51.970
<v Speaker 1>chancellor of Germany as the World Bank</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a briefing,</v>

25
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.250
<v Speaker 1>which is remarkable actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

26
00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:56.980
<v Speaker 1>to be briefed on poverty and development</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

27
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>And so we had a meeting with him in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant near Hanover on a Sunday.</v>

28
00:02:03.401 --> 00:02:05.420
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Wolfensohn Nick Stern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who then wrote this famous climate</v>

30
00:02:08.771 --> 00:02:13.771
<v Speaker 1>change report for the British government</v>
<v Speaker 1>later and myself and Chancellor Schroder</v>

31
00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:14.854
<v Speaker 1>and two people.</v>

32
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.910
<v Speaker 1>And since I had organized the meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had kept one hour at the back of the</v>

33
00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:24.490
<v Speaker 1>meeting for my ideas on global</v>
<v Speaker 1>governance and global issues.</v>

34
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.340
<v Speaker 1>And so Wolfensohn spoke for three or</v>
<v Speaker 1>four hours and poverty and development.</v>

35
00:02:30.341 --> 00:02:32.560
<v Speaker 1>And then I started to talk about global</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

36
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.320
<v Speaker 1>And Chancellor Schroder was very</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested,</v>

37
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.520
<v Speaker 1>and Jim Wolfensohn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was intrigued and interested as</v>

38
00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:42.910
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the evening when we had dinner</v>

39
00:02:42.911 --> 00:02:46.300
<v Speaker 1>together after a successful day with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chancellor Schroder,</v>

40
00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:49.750
<v Speaker 1>I asked Wolfensohn what to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

41
00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:51.730
<v Speaker 1>these ideas go far beyond the World</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bank.</v>

42
00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:56.731
<v Speaker 1>So write them up on under your own name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that led me to write the book,</v>

43
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.920
<v Speaker 1>which is a book that was critical of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] of the UN and so forth.</v>

44
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>But somehow I got away with it a while</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in the institution as a sitting</v>

45
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:13.561
<v Speaker 1>vice president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that shows you one more time how a</v>

46
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>open minded institution it was at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

47
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.540
<v Speaker 1>And I'm grateful for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

48
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>and then the book led into many speeches</v>
<v Speaker 1>and into a whole campaign on these</v>

49
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was the origin of it.</v>
