1
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.250
<v Speaker 1>It was founded in 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Originally we had grade seven through</v>

2
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>nine of for 200 students designed as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>college prep school.</v>

3
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 19,</v>

4
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2005,</v>

5
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>we expanded the school and move to a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>location.</v>

6
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.070
<v Speaker 1>And so today we're serving a 1100</v>
<v Speaker 1>students in kindergarten through twelfth</v>

7
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:30.801
<v Speaker 1>grade and these are inner city kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started teaching back in 1995 and did</v>

8
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>that for five years in the urban core of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kansas City.</v>

9
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>And then another fellow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have also a former CEO got</v>

10
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>together and decided to start our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

11
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:47.550
<v Speaker 1>And this was at the time when charter</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools were starting to take the</v>

12
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Speaker 1>country by storm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

13
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we,</v>

14
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did some planning and sure enough we</v>

15
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>were able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>give birth to a school.</v>
