1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Speaker 1>The question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are some Americans,</v>

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.890
<v Speaker 1>people in the world homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do they fear the gay and why did</v>

3
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>they oppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in America so strongly,</v>

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 1>gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay unions.</v>

5
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.280
<v Speaker 1>I am not convinced that that many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>really have a problem with gay marriage.</v>

6
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.430
<v Speaker 1>I think there are some people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely hate and fear the gay and are</v>

7
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.830
<v Speaker 1>very opposed to the gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it has become a consistent and</v>

8
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>dependable fundraiser to where if every</v>
<v Speaker 1>homosexual person in America said,</v>

9
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're awful,</v>

10
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>we have a bad lifestyle and will slither</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the rock that we,</v>

11
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>that we should be living under and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>never asked to be married again,</v>

12
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>so we'll just take our queer assets and</v>
<v Speaker 1>scuttled back into the slimy shadows</v>

13
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:58.191
<v Speaker 1>where we belong with the slugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would lose a major fundraising tool</v>

14
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 1>and people in the room would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

15
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:01.650
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

16
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Come back queer marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Want to get married?</v>

17
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need you in the Bible belt.</v>

18
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>We need you in South Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arkansas,</v>

19
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>

20
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>To raise the bucks because Islamophobia</v>
<v Speaker 1>only goes so far,</v>

21
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 1>but hating the gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one always runs that one.</v>

22
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Always performs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'll always,</v>

23
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>you'll always have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>up for debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes people fear the gay and gay</v>

25
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:36.411
<v Speaker 1>marriage is because you're giving these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people equality and that's the biggest</v>

26
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:41.421
<v Speaker 1>fear that people with power have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get some two people get married.</v>

27
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole contract is completely insane.</v>

28
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I live in the state of California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I married some Nice Gal and we got</v>

29
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:54.090
<v Speaker 1>divorced by law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does she get half of my record</v>

30
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:59.091
<v Speaker 1>collection was no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She might after I get done with a</v>

31
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>chainsaw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's not getting my ramones first</v>

32
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>pressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

33
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

34
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>She's not getting my Bob Ludwig mastered</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of houses.</v>

35
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 1>The holy high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think not.</v>

36
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>She can go on Ebay and overpaid like I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did for her own copy.</v>

37
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.860
<v Speaker 1>So marriage for me is I love to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>weddings,</v>

38
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.040
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to be married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if two people are crazy enough to be</v>

39
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>that in love with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great thing.</v>

40
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Give them a break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lights really short.</v>

41
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Let him have a little happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two men,</v>

42
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:34.850
<v Speaker 1>they're married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in a house.</v>

43
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Houses are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

44
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.920
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't smell any different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look any different than the</v>

45
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>lawn looks fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a gay,</v>

46
00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay marriage and don't have one.</v>

47
00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No woman wants to have an abortion,</v>

48
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>but they gotta have the right to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>one safely without any.</v>

49
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Your opinion does not matter here and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

50
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.770
<v Speaker 1>in this century there's going to be gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage is going to be okay in a more</v>

51
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 1>than half of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we used to have slaves,</v>

52
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 1>so that's why we have amendments to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution,</v>

53
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>so it has wiggle room.</v>

54
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I think that gay marriage is already</v>
<v Speaker 1>covered under the first amendment,</v>

55
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this conversation's over to</v>

56
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>where there shouldn't be against</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything against the law about two men</v>

57
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>or women getting married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always breaks down to a religious</v>

58
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>thing and they'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well know they have all the equality</v>

59
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:33.860
<v Speaker 1>they need and Rara.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

60
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then are you,</v>

61
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 1>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you one of those radical Christian</v>

62
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:38.051
<v Speaker 1>as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

63
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>That has nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It it,</v>

64
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>it kind of does a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's it.</v>

65
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Basically you have ignorance and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have hatred.</v>

66
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 1>What a lot of these people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand is they are surrounded by the</v>

67
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 1>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.140
<v Speaker 1>they got gays in their family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At thanksgiving I was at,</v>

69
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 1>I went to an all boys school and I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay bosses as a kid growing up.</v>

70
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Washington DC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just a lot of gay people.</v>

71
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.650
<v Speaker 1>My mom had gay friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

72
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I got it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understood it.</v>

73
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>I never feared it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

74
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:09.030
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

75
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.730
<v Speaker 1>my Boston high school at the movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>theater with this was this amazing man</v>

76
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:17.731
<v Speaker 1>of Portuguese descent with incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair who's like a fantastic old school</v>

77
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like character actor,</v>

78
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Oldschool Queen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

79
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name was Bob on Saturday nights he</v>

80
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 1>reverted to Roberta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roberta,</v>

81
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.410
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I,</v>

82
00:04:30.411 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>I spent high school with this guy every</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday night at the movie theater.</v>

83
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>We had the best time and if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if my uptight friends from my suburban</v>

84
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:41.440
<v Speaker 1>prep school could have seen who I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with,</v>

85
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

86
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.030
<v Speaker 1>So I had no problem with the gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also gave me good Gaydar and in</v>

87
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:50.320
<v Speaker 1>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we all hit like ninth and 10th</v>

88
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 1>grade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

89
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I realized like we've got gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have at least two gay teachers and</v>

90
00:04:56.771 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>I've got gay gay peers.</v>

91
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.350
<v Speaker 1>There's gay students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One guy's Kinda like,</v>

92
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mini Dick Cheney's that are just</v>

93
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.850
<v Speaker 1>keeping it to himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One guy like,</v>

94
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gay and you're,</v>

95
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

96
00:05:08.961 --> 00:05:10.510
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're okay with it,</v>

97
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's keeping it to himself.</v>

98
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.040
<v Speaker 1>And this is one poor guy who was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.580
<v Speaker 1>gay right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he hit 10th or 11th grade and like,</v>

100
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Hello September at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

101
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

102
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.920
<v Speaker 1>because I just saw what was gonna happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to him and we had some really bad</v>

103
00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:32.110
<v Speaker 1>teachers there and one teacher would</v>
<v Speaker 1>make fun of him,</v>

104
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 1>made fun of his name and turned it into</v>
<v Speaker 1>an anti gay slur.</v>

105
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.300
<v Speaker 1>So that teacher basically greenlighted</v>
<v Speaker 1>him if you know the term,</v>

106
00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 1>basically a green light of the guy for</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a death warrant because once the</v>

107
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:46.630
<v Speaker 1>teacher can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means you can do that.</v>

108
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 1>This is not good leadership that</v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers should have never as an adult</v>

109
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:52.270
<v Speaker 1>with a bunch of stupid high school</v>
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

110
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>me being one of them should have never</v>
<v Speaker 1>okayed that and by the end of the school</v>

111
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy had his head put in the toilet.</v>

112
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 1>He was a dorm kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a dorm at the school for post</v>

113
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:08.021
<v Speaker 1>grads and kids who live far from home</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he got teased enough to where he</v>

114
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 1>locked himself in his room and tried to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill himself by slashing his wrists.</v>

115
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Thankfully he did not succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at Christmas break he left.</v>

116
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 1>He never came back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name was never mentioned in the</v>

117
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 1>school again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That made me Auntie homophobe.</v>

120
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

121
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:34.091
<v Speaker 1>gay rights to me is it's civil rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it when I see racism,</v>

122
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:37.760
<v Speaker 1>which I encountered having it being done</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me as a kid from the sixties and</v>

123
00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Washington DC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I see homophobia,</v>

124
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that straw that breaks the camel's</v>

125
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm the camel.</v>

126
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.013
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

127
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 1>I go hard against it real hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real loud,</v>

128
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.470

<v Speaker 1>real right now.</v>

129
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.550
<v Speaker 1>And so what you combated in America is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of undereducated people who have</v>

130
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 1>some idea that Christianity is about</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat up on the gay.</v>

131
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.150
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people just like to hate and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay person even though you're surrounded</v>

132
00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 1>by them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

133
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 1>as I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I tell my audiences that show,</v>

134
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:13.880
<v Speaker 1>they go dig it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was gay cavemen,</v>

135
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets your head around that.</v>

136
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 1>There was like big hairy men from</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of years ago going like,</v>

137
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.320

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go hit the bushes and like see</v>

141
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:35.230

<v Speaker 1>Why some people can't absorb and accept</v>

142
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:38.660
<v Speaker 1>and deal with that information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too bad.</v>

143
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.900
<v Speaker 1>I believe things are getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think homophobia is an endangered</v>

144
00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:47.690
<v Speaker 1>species in America as long as I'm around</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>pushing against him.</v>
