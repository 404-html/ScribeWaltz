1
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.070
<v Speaker 1>You can sense that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2
00:00:10.071 --> 00:00:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time I met,</v>

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meryl Streep was at this theater that I</v>

5
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.660
<v Speaker 1>told you about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Phoenix theater.</v>

6
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.530
<v Speaker 1>And she walked in and she had her pants</v>
<v Speaker 1>old tied up because she was riding a</v>

7
00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:31.631
<v Speaker 1>bike to the audition and she had a wheel</v>
<v Speaker 1>or wheel of her pain in her hands and</v>

8
00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:35.690
<v Speaker 1>her hair was all messy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

9
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:38.450
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's glorious.</v>

10
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.110
<v Speaker 1>She is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just beautiful.</v>

11
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.240
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.040
<v Speaker 1>so you do get those feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Do,</v>

13
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>you are drawn to people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.160
<v Speaker 1>come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come sit down next to you and talk to</v>

15
00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:58.880
<v Speaker 1>you and you see something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're not necessarily right for</v>

16
00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:00.440
<v Speaker 1>the park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about their</v>

17
00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you want to put them in another</v>

18
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:03.800
<v Speaker 1>role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.260
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room changes,</v>

20
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.620
<v Speaker 1>the color changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually golden golden,</v>

21
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.170
<v Speaker 1>golden yellow I think is for me.</v>

22
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.370
<v Speaker 1>And I get very excited and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

23
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.610
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to place these performers in,</v>

24
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.630
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

25
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:24.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in either the role that they've come in</v>

26
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:27.020
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in another part,</v>

27
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I like to think that when I cast or</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie</v>

28
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.310
<v Speaker 1>or even working on a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would be a movie that people</v>

29
00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:41.150
<v Speaker 1>will see a hundred years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what I always look at</v>

30
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.040
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will people look at this project,</v>

31
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:48.110
<v Speaker 1>this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this actor,</v>

32
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:50.480
<v Speaker 1>and a hundred years in the same way we</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at,</v>

33
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Betty Davis and,</v>

34
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cary grant and Humphrey Bogart.</v>

35
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.690
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

36
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>I think we were looking at them for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>

37
00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

38
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 1>the goal to see that talent that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think will last forever and ever and</v>

39
00:02:11.891 --> 00:02:12.160
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
