00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.980
<v Speaker 1>A couple of christmases ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this,</v>

2
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.060

<v Speaker 1>who sold me a.</v>

3
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.140
<v Speaker 1>It still sells us these incredible oils</v>
<v Speaker 1>from France,</v>

4
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.970
<v Speaker 1>from Burgundy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the maker is incredibly expensive.</v>

5
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.580
<v Speaker 1>It's this guy's so artism like he does</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in his garage behind his house.</v>

6
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:31.930
<v Speaker 1>He knows guys like another Wackadoo and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he,</v>

7
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.520
<v Speaker 1>the Frenchman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the artisanal producers,</v>

8
00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Jeanmarc Montonya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gave the distributor Olivia a</v>

9
00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:41.690
<v Speaker 1>president for us because we were the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest customer and his first,</v>

10
00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:45.760
<v Speaker 1>I think one of his first and he gave us</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gift for Christmas.</v>

11
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Olivia handed to me and I open the box</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

12
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.150
<v Speaker 1>it's this box of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of dust.</v>

13
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.220
<v Speaker 1>It smells a little bit like nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just dust.</v>

14
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.330
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

15
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.710
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Olivia says,</v>

16
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.601
<v Speaker 1>I'll live a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:56.601 --> 00:01:00.710
<v Speaker 1>John Mark wanted to give you a after he</v>
<v Speaker 1>a president that,</v>

18
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.660
<v Speaker 1>that have have nut dust.</v>

19
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.750
<v Speaker 1>It's basically after he presses the nuts</v>
<v Speaker 1>for his oil,</v>

20
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:07.490
<v Speaker 1>he has all this residue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

21
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.320
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Olivia said,</v>

22
00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:12.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last year I went over to to burgundy and</v>

23
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:16.820
<v Speaker 1>I had lunch with Sean Mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I opened the door to go into his</v>

24
00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was there on the stove,</v>

25
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:22.010
<v Speaker 1>saw tank potatoes and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we sat down to,</v>

26
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.270
<v Speaker 1>to a salad and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a little like fried potatoes,</v>

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.990
<v Speaker 1>potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Olivia said all he could taste from</v>

28
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:30.950
<v Speaker 1>the salads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>potatoes,</v>

29
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.840
<v Speaker 1>all I could taste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're Ahmed's.</v>

30
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.450
<v Speaker 1>He didn't see any artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just smelled this overwhelming thing</v>

31
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.940
<v Speaker 1>was he thought like there was some kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of almond souffle coming for dessert or</v>

32
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's no honest to fly.</v>

33
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>So he asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he asked mark,</v>

34
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.151
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark,</v>

35
00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:42.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's delicious.</v>

36
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Meal tasting is Ahmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And John Mark said,</v>

37
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.750
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after I pressed the,</v>

38
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.260
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the almonds,</v>

39
00:01:48.261 --> 00:01:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I have this residue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

40
00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dust is not that.</v>

41
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Instead of throwing it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I throw it onto my potato fields</v>

42
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of it on my potato fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And through this incredible process of</v>

43
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Osmosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.140
<v Speaker 1>he gets almond potatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

45
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.510
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's telling me this and I'm looking</v>

46
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:06.500
<v Speaker 1>at my box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

47
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.330
<v Speaker 1>this is the secret to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.470
<v Speaker 1>my millions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.710
<v Speaker 1>So I take the stuff and I called a nut</v>
<v Speaker 1>company out in California and organic</v>

50
00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 1>and that company asked them for like 500</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds of,</v>

51
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of I thought pine nuts because I thought</v>

52
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>I could one up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

53
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.580
<v Speaker 1>I started to get competitive with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

54
00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:24.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know who gave me a gift</v>
<v Speaker 1>pine that we did.</v>

55
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.221
<v Speaker 1>We did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

56
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>and again we did walnut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got all these nuts and,</v>

57
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.260
<v Speaker 1>and jack spread them on carrots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to do it with potatoes</v>

58
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:34.490
<v Speaker 1>because I thought it'd be too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity.</v>

59
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Carrots and we have a lot of carrots</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the winter.</v>

60
00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:37.970
<v Speaker 1>So we spread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spread,</v>

61
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:38.481
<v Speaker 1>spread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spread,</v>

62
00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:39.590
<v Speaker 1>spread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

63
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.640
<v Speaker 1>I decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.570
<v Speaker 1>with my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to make some.</v>

<v Speaker 1>an almond carrot night because we</v>

69
00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:54.460
<v Speaker 1>figured that would be the one that</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked the pestle.</v>

70
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Almond carrot night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We invite the whole dining rooms packed</v>

71

00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>really late that afternoon and I hadn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually really tasted the carrot,</v>

79
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like 4:30 and I'm bored sitting</v>

80
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>there cleaning carrots and like I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started to taste them and right as I'm</v>

81
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:26.810
<v Speaker 1>tasting them again and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

82
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>too much to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the tickets are coming in,</v>

83
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like five,</v>

84
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and carrot salad,</v>

85

<v Speaker 1>six Almond Garrett's salads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86

<v Speaker 1>double order obamacare.</v>

87
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>It's out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I take a bite of the carrots,</v>

88
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>no almond flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

89
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zilch.</v>

90
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even taste like there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential for almond in the future.</v>

91
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a delicious carrot.</v>

92
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ahmed total failure.</v>

93
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.680
<v Speaker 1>So I sliced the carrots are like all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sudden tickets are coming in and</v>

94
00:03:52.681 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 1>coming in like a 30 tickets on the board</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like 500 almond south.</v>

95
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>And so I started slicing the carrots</v>
<v Speaker 1>really quickly,</v>

96
00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pepper,</v>

97
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 1>lemon vinegarette and I reached for John</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marks,</v>

98
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>almond oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of which I have a few extra bottles and</v>

99
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I start dousing it with almond oil and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mix it and then I give it to the waiters</v>

100
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:10.960
<v Speaker 1>just to taste before they go out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dining room.</v>

101
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Genius man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tastes like,</v>

102

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

103
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking damn is a genius,</v>

104
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.910
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that night we sell 120 carat salads</v>

105
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.720
<v Speaker 1>and it is the greatest success in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his is the best night we've ever had at</v>

106
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Blue Hill.</v>

107
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Every episode I ever had any restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 1>people wrote emails.</v>

108
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>It's still talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was still talking about it.</v>

109
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 1>People say it's the most exciting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>most delicious,</v>

110
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience I've ever had in a</v>

111
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 1>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a buzz in the diag,</v>

112
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:40.630
<v Speaker 1>never had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I realized at the end of the</v>

113
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.780
<v Speaker 1>night in the mayhem of plating all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>salads,</v>

114
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was crazy night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot to put the almond oil in the,</v>

115
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.230
<v Speaker 1>in the carrots I did on some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't on a lot and it did not</v>

116
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It absolutely did not matter.</v>

117
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 1>People taste it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almonds,</v>

118
00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:59.900
<v Speaker 1>because you told them the story and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasted the most delicious character</v>

119
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.860
<v Speaker 1>their life because they had this funny</v>
<v Speaker 1>story that they felt invested in and</v>

120
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 1>they felt a part of and they wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be connected to.</v>

121
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I think we're hardwired for this mess.</v>

122
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>My ultimate theory is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:12.730
<v Speaker 1>as hunter gatherers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were spending our time figuring out</v>

124
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:14.020
<v Speaker 1>is that thing poisonous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing,</v>

125
00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:15.820
<v Speaker 1>delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that thing feed our children,</v>

126
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that thing,</v>

127
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>nutritious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

128
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that's been bred out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us,</v>

129
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when someone gives you a story of</v>

130
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:23.760
<v Speaker 1>this kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it,</v>

131
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.470
<v Speaker 1>it informs us and relaxes us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relate to taste,</v>

132
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:28.030
<v Speaker 1>things that we otherwise wouldn't taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's my,</v>

133
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have so many stories like that</v>

134
00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:32.530
<v Speaker 1>that just like it teaches me again and</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

135
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>you have a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have delicious food,</v>

136
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you really don't screw it up,</v>

137
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:37.430
<v Speaker 1>you have malicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there you go.</v>
