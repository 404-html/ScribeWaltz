1
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.690
<v Speaker 1>I think that everyone in the world could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a math person if they wanted to.</v>

2
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.810
<v Speaker 1>The key word though I want to say is if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to.</v>

3
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.140
<v Speaker 1>That said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that everyone in America</v>

4
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.550
<v Speaker 1>could benefit from having that matt bath</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematical backgrounds in reasoning</v>

5
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.950
<v Speaker 1>just to help everyone make very good</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

6
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.060
<v Speaker 1>And here I'm distinguishing already</v>
<v Speaker 1>between math as people usually conceive</v>

7
00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:29.440
<v Speaker 1>of it and decision making and analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually what I think math is.</v>

8
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.700
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that being a math person</v>

9
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.910
<v Speaker 1>means that you can recite the formulas</v>
<v Speaker 1>between signs,</v>

10
00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:41.020
<v Speaker 1>co-signs tangents and to use logarithms</v>
<v Speaker 1>and exponentials interchangeably.</v>

11
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.820
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessarily what I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone should try to concentrate to</v>

12
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:48.370
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main things to concentrate to</v>

13
00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:51.490
<v Speaker 1>understand are the mathematical</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles of reasoning.</v>

14
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.590
<v Speaker 1>But let me go back to these signs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Co-Signs and,</v>

15
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.011
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

16
00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:54.910
<v Speaker 1>and logarithms.</v>

17
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Well actually if they do have value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they are is that they are ways to</v>

18
00:00:58.631 --> 00:01:03.631
<v Speaker 1>show you how these basic building blocks</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reasoning can be used to deduce</v>

19
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.410
<v Speaker 1>surprising things or difficult things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense.</v>

20
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.060
<v Speaker 1>They're like the historical coverages of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the triumphs of mathematics,</v>

21
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.100
<v Speaker 1>so one cannot just talk abstractly</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

22
00:01:15.101 --> 00:01:15.521
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

23
00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:18.760
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about mathematical logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually quite useful to have case</v>

24
00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:20.500
<v Speaker 1>studies or stories which are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are these,</v>

25
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.310
<v Speaker 1>these famous theorems now I actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that these are accessible to</v>

26
00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:26.410
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that actually one reason</v>

27
00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:30.370
<v Speaker 1>mathematics is difficult to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually because of that network of</v>

28
00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:33.190
<v Speaker 1>prerequisites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see math is one of these strange</v>

29
00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:38.191
<v Speaker 1>subjects for which the concepts are</v>
<v Speaker 1>chained in sequences of dependencies.</v>

30
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.310
<v Speaker 1>When you have long chains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are very few starting points.</v>

31
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Very few things I need to memorize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to memorize,</v>

32
00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:47.950
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things in history such as when</v>

33
00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:51.010
<v Speaker 1>was the war of 1812 well actually I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one because that's a matter of</v>

34
00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:51.190
<v Speaker 1>fact.</v>

35
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.000
<v Speaker 1>It was 1812 but I can't tell you a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of other facts which are just purely</v>

36
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.150
<v Speaker 1>memorized in mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are very few that you memorize and</v>

37
00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:02.110
<v Speaker 1>the rest you did use as you go through</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this chain of deductions is actually</v>

38
00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:03.760
<v Speaker 1>what's critical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

39
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.980
<v Speaker 1>let me contrast that with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjects.</v>

40
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Like say history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>History doesn't have this long chain.</v>

41
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you fully understand the war of 1812</v>

42
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.820
<v Speaker 1>that's great and it is true that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will influence perhaps your</v>

43
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.860
<v Speaker 1>understanding later of the women's</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

44
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.420
<v Speaker 1>But it won't be as absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>prerequisite in the sense that if you</v>

45
00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:25.030
<v Speaker 1>think about the concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that history has more</v>

46
00:02:25.031 --> 00:02:27.470
<v Speaker 1>concepts than mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that they're spread out</v>

47
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.880
<v Speaker 1>broader and they don't depend on each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other as strongly.</v>

48
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.160
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you miss a week,</v>

49
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.200
<v Speaker 1>you will miss the understanding of one</v>
<v Speaker 1>unit,</v>

50
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.050
<v Speaker 1>but that won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that won't stop you from understanding</v>

51
00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:39.550
<v Speaker 1>all of the rest of the components.</v>

52
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.420
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually the difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>between math and other subjects.</v>

53
00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:45.730
<v Speaker 1>In my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>math has fewer concepts,</v>

54
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.760
<v Speaker 1>but they're chained deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of the way that we usually</v>

55
00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:50.650
<v Speaker 1>learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have deep chains,</v>

56
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.590
<v Speaker 1>it's very fragile because you're gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose anyone link meeting.</v>

57
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.990
<v Speaker 1>If you miss a few concepts along the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chain,</v>

58
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.060
<v Speaker 1>you can actually be completely lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

59
00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sick a week or if your mind is</v>

60
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else for a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might make a hole in your</v>

61
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 1>prerequisites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way that education often works</v>

62
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 1>where it's almost like riding a train</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a beginning to an end.</v>

63
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such that if you have a whole</v>

64
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>summer and your track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the train is not going to pass that</v>

65
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 1>hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I think that the way to help to</v>

66
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>address this is to provide a way for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone to learn at their own pace and</v>

67
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>in fact a fill in the holes whenever</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are sensed.</v>

68
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 1>And I actually feel like if everyone was</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to pick up every one of those</v>

69
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>prerequisites as necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filling in any gaps they have,</v>

70
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 1>mathematics would change from being the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardest subject to the easiest subject.</v>

71
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone's a math person and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one has to do is to go through the</v>

72
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:43.670
<v Speaker 1>chain and fill in all the gaps and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll understand it easier,</v>

73
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>more better than all the other subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
