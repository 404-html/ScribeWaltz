1
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.210
<v Speaker 1>So there is so much career advice for</v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

2
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Best career advice that you are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting is to invest.</v>

3
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.771
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

4
00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:18.290
<v Speaker 1>That has absolutely nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>my performance.</v>

5
00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:19.190
<v Speaker 1>The job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

6
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.830
<v Speaker 1>but it does have to do with having more</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

7
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.660
<v Speaker 1>And if you are investing to the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>extent that the guys are that will on</v>

8
00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:30.200
<v Speaker 1>average and has historically added to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wealth,</v>

9
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.690
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of dollars for</v>
<v Speaker 1>some women,</v>

10
00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:34.820
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars over the course of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives.</v>

11
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 1>What happens when you've got more money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can play looser,</v>

12
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can with more confidence.</v>

13
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.000
<v Speaker 1>Go in and ask for that promotion for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that overseas assignment.</v>

14
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Quit that job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot stand because that boss is</v>

15
00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:55.070
<v Speaker 1>such a jerk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start Your own business.</v>

16
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>test your own business.</v>

17
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>The degrees of freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we've got more money are</v>

18
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:03.980
<v Speaker 1>substantial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll even take it,</v>

19
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way to also help us get to</v>

20
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:08.600
<v Speaker 1>equality with men.</v>

21
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.930
<v Speaker 1>That confidence in the workforce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that equality ladies,</v>

22
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:15.410
<v Speaker 1>we will not be equal with men until</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're financially equal with men.</v>

23
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.440
<v Speaker 1>So the best career advice you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting is to invest.</v>

24
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.770
<v Speaker 1>I wish I didn't have to give you this</v>
<v Speaker 1>advice that I wish every company out</v>

25
00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>there just let you be you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:28.191 --> 00:01:31.670
<v Speaker 1>and that you're just not comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>going in and negotiating for the raise</v>

27
00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:36.080
<v Speaker 1>and not to force you to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pay close that gender pay gap,</v>

28
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.410
<v Speaker 1>pay everybody exactly what they're worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not make negotiating a core part of</v>

29
00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>getting compensated in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wish I didn't have to do that.</v>

30
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do.</v>

31
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.980
<v Speaker 1>And so we have to accept the world as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is today.</v>

32
00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>And so ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to negotiate from the first job.</v>

33
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.180
<v Speaker 1>You just have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let me give you the example why.</v>

34
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.620
<v Speaker 1>So I managed a lot of people over a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of years and I will tell you that every</v>

35
00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:06.710
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost every guy who reported to me</v>

36
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.970
<v Speaker 1>before bonus time would come into my</v>
<v Speaker 1>office and tell me how much they wanted</v>

37
00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:14.270
<v Speaker 1>to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every guy every year typically told</v>

38
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:17.720
<v Speaker 1>me more than he was in the budget for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so think about what happens,</v>

39
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim and Mary.</v>

40
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Jim and Mary are both in the budget for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bonus or a raise of five each.</v>

41
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Jim Comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells me he wants 10 never hear from</v>

42
00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Mary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I giggle to myself that Jim,</v>

43
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:35.990
<v Speaker 1>he so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know we're never paid him 10 well,</v>

44
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:38.480
<v Speaker 1>it comes around time to put the budget</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

45
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.840
<v Speaker 1>give out the raises are the bonuses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know my hr head and I both know Jim</v>

46
00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:46.460
<v Speaker 1>wants 10 wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know we're not going to pay him 10</v>

47
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.180
<v Speaker 1>you know his office door was closed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other day and the guys on the street are</v>

48
00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:54.620
<v Speaker 1>looking for someone like Jim.</v>

49
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.480
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he made a really good point.</v>

50
00:02:56.481 --> 00:02:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I totally forgot about the project he</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

51
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>We'll pay him seven now how much does</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary make?</v>

52
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>The answer usually is five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The right answer of course is three</v>

53
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 1>because car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because Jim asked for more and I</v>

54
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>choose to give him more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean my bonus pool goes up.</v>

55
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean my budget goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there is to some extent a zero</v>

56
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>sum game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right ladies.</v>

57
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Now that I've convinced you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we approach it with facts,</v>

58
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>so much of the [inaudible] and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>advance?</v>

59
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>So much of the advice to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it sort of in the meaning in the</v>

60
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 1>moment you have to start planting those</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeds?</v>

61
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:32.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

62
