00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.563
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.500
<v Speaker 1>I think writers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter where you,</v>

3
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.460
<v Speaker 1>how many places you might settle in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

4
00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:17.000
<v Speaker 1>you're always only from one place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me that's,</v>

5
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working class,</v>

6
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>outer borough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.120
<v Speaker 1>immigrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.210
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a housing project so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:29.900
<v Speaker 1>that tends to be home for me when it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when something sort of piques my</v>

10
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:33.590
<v Speaker 1>interest and makes me want to write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always tend to be gravitating back</v>

11
00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>towards that no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.270
<v Speaker 1>and I don't really challenge it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go at it.</v>

13
00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:39.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to write it about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish armada just to show people I'm</v>

15
00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:43.340
<v Speaker 1>versatile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

16
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

17
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.610
<v Speaker 1>if that's where something's telling me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go,</v>

18
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:51.611
<v Speaker 1>I just go and I do the best job I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully every timeout I'm writing</v>

19
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.550
<v Speaker 1>a little more nuanced and about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>different facet of life.</v>

20
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.091
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:57.760
<v Speaker 1>a place is just a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.230
<v Speaker 1>it's what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about the human nature.</v>

23
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.270
<v Speaker 1>The only thing anybody ever writes about</v>
<v Speaker 1>his trouble,</v>

24
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can find plenty of trouble.</v>

25
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.160
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

26
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:07.850
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

27
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.520
<v Speaker 1>if I grew up in the Midwest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

28
00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:13.100
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably be writing about farms and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:14.360
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and midwestern life.</v>

30
00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:16.130
<v Speaker 1>I was a southerner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be trying to write like some tea,</v>

32
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>third rate,</v>

33
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.920
<v Speaker 1>William Faulkner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was from the desert,</v>

34
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:23.870
<v Speaker 1>I'd write like Cormac McCarthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:24.440
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

36
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>you go back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

37
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.590
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear it calling to your whole life</v>

38
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.180
<v Speaker 1>no matter where you,</v>

39
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>
