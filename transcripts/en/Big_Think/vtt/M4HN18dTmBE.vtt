00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a religion has both positive and</v>

2
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:16.350
<v Speaker 1>negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wars of religion clearly negative,</v>

3
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you have to have something</v>
<v Speaker 1>to believe,</v>

5
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>some things to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a important,</v>

6
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 1>obviously technological advances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>I read a recent statistic which just</v>
<v Speaker 1>blew my mind away that,</v>

8
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today the average American has 10 times</v>

9
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 1>as much material resources as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American at the Americans had it,</v>

10
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>the civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>which is just a phenomenal thing when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you consider,</v>

12
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>and it's all because of technological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific and Tuck,</v>

13
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>the logical advances and the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>harness energy,</v>

14
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.900
<v Speaker 1>the ability to transform energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just phenomenal driver in society.</v>

15
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both positive and,</v>

16
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have better killing machines to,</v>

17
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

18
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.980
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.220
<v Speaker 1>both of those things are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.940
<v Speaker 1>I think phenomenally important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

21
00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:13.250
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have much progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>in terms of improvement in living</v>
<v Speaker 1>standards for a millennia until really</v>

23
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:19.250
<v Speaker 1>the development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 1>in the 16th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17th century of science and the ability</v>

25
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>to transform science into technology.</v>

26
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I think we don't appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flush toilet enough.</v>

28
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>It's just indoor plumbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indoor heating.</v>

29
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.751
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>in the late 19 seventies and early</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties lived in Oxford in rooms that</v>

31
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>had no central heating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had a heating coil and,</v>

32
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you get to appreciate central</v>

33
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:48.260
<v Speaker 1>heating and the fact that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually live at 70 degrees all year</v>

34
00:01:48.261 --> 00:01:52.800
<v Speaker 1>round a lot more when you are freezing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't actually get to sleep</v>

35
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:55.340
<v Speaker 1>because you're shivering so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's just a phenomenal</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing we take for granted in our</v>

37
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's been a very short time since</v>

38
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.430
<v Speaker 1>that's been.</v>
