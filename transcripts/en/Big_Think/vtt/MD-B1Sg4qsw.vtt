1
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.170
<v Speaker 1>It's clear that in terms of optimistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>positivity is a predictor of mortality.</v>

2
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.390
<v Speaker 1>It does predict mortality and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>predicts mortality when you control for</v>

3
00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:15.020
<v Speaker 1>lots of different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.170
<v Speaker 1>self reported health problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression scales that have been</v>

5
00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:22.520
<v Speaker 1>validated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self reported health.</v>

6
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.910
<v Speaker 1>If you're interested in predicting</v>
<v Speaker 1>things from optimism or optimistic</v>

7
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.640
<v Speaker 1>positivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to look at what predicts it.</v>

8
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I was focusing on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that first paper.</v>

9
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.280
<v Speaker 1>So we have three papers already started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically we're looking at,</v>

10
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explicit measures of optimism as well as</v>

11
00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:47.140
<v Speaker 1>these were using wording effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.940
<v Speaker 1>to measure what we calling him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Implicit measures of,</v>

13
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close to perceptual optimism and</v>

14
00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:57.410
<v Speaker 1>pessimism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That positive wording bias is a form of</v>

15
00:00:57.411 --> 00:00:59.420
<v Speaker 1>optimism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're looking at the world in</v>

16
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:02.690
<v Speaker 1>more positive ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taking information in and you're</v>

17
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:06.470
<v Speaker 1>framing it in positive ways and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing it so you're reacting to it and</v>

18
00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:08.030
<v Speaker 1>positive ways sometimes in the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

19
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:09.650
<v Speaker 1>you don't even know that you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

20
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.690
<v Speaker 1>It's so subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a wording effect that you</v>

21
00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:13.040
<v Speaker 1>couldn't say that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.220
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I'm asking you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you responding this way to these</v>

23
00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 1>words of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ways,</v>

24
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:19.490
<v Speaker 1>that words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can detect it statistically over</v>

25
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.280
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're asking people to say</v>

26
00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:24.890
<v Speaker 1>things about themselves on a survey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

27
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.690
<v Speaker 1>you're asking them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:30.020
<v Speaker 1>are you a good person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you a competent person?</v>

29
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole series of questions you</v>

30
00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:33.590
<v Speaker 1>can ask them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them will,</v>

31
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>already positively some of them and</v>

32
00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:38.480
<v Speaker 1>negatively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And usually those wording,</v>

33
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those survey questions are,</v>

34
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to,</v>

35
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create scales of things like self</v>

36
00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:50.930
<v Speaker 1>esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self efficacy mastery.</v>

37
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.260
<v Speaker 1>There's a latent variable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that there's something out</v>

38
00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:57.290
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's latent and it explained some</v>

39
00:01:57.291 --> 00:01:59.720
<v Speaker 1>variance in how people answer these</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

40
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.490
<v Speaker 1>And we're putting that together with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some measures that acts.</v>

41
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask people about how optimistic they are</v>

42
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.290
<v Speaker 1>using language explicitly and saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that together those things create this</v>

43
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're saying that the phenomenon</v>

44
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.330
<v Speaker 1>goes deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.220
<v Speaker 1>to level of perception is itself a form</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

46
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of stratification.</v>

47
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.620
<v Speaker 1>If is there something about optimism</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

48
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a resource that we can understand</v>

49
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.960
<v Speaker 1>as a psychological good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like happiness,</v>

50
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if it's stratified in the</v>

51
00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:38.540
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it an associated with other kinds</v>

52
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:40.460
<v Speaker 1>of stratification in column and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

53
00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:41.780
<v Speaker 1>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Education.</v>

54
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.920
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:43.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saying,</v>

56
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:45.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>

57
00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:46.670
<v Speaker 1>the real interesting one is class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

58
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.040
<v Speaker 1>or</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull yourself up by your bootstraps.</v>

60
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:53.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think positively.</v>

61
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 1>You'll be successful if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic,</v>

62
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:55.760
<v Speaker 1>you will be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

63
00:02:55.761 --> 00:02:56.720
<v Speaker 1>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's successful,</v>

64
00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna be optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the reverse thing.</v>

65
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:03.090
<v Speaker 1>And so taking a class and looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>classes,</v>

66
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>really the really interesting part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I want to get to,</v>

67
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's an interesting</v>

68
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>question because there's a lot of theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>around sociology and emotions around,</v>

69
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

70
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>the idea that expectations are created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to meet expectations</v>

71
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>generates energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That energy is what allows people to do</v>

72
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:24.394
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

73
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.960
<v Speaker 1>It's something that emotional energy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

74
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it replicates itself.</v>

75
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>So people are convinced to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic,</v>

77
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 1>especially in the middle classes.</v>

78
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

79
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 1>And if they're not able to achieve those</v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations,</v>

80
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.500
<v Speaker 1>then that energy goes down and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>become dissatisfied.</v>

81
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 1>There's some difference with cohorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now I see with race difference,</v>

82
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>I see cohort differences when you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>born.</v>

83
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>And that makes sense in terms of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like civil rights movement and what you</v>

84
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 1>experienced in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

85
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.131
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

86
00:04:02.131 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your hopes and dreams and,</v>

87
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

88
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question I'm looking at now first,</v>

89
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

90
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't change,</v>

91
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not many.</v>

92
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>There's not much way that your optimism</v>
<v Speaker 1>or pessimism going to change your gender</v>

93
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:17.140
<v Speaker 1>in a statistically significant way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

94
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 1>night change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can change their gender,</v>

95
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's not gonna Change your age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not gonna Change your birth cohort</v>

96
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.300
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very small effects.</v>

98
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 1>So I'm looking at those things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>

99
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.950
<v Speaker 1>that can be understood as causes of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can't be reversed causality</v>

100
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:33.784
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

101
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

102
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ran these models and what do we see?</v>

103
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Well we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw that when you look at all these</v>

104
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

105
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.171
<v Speaker 1>birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cohort,</v>

106
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:48.460
<v Speaker 1>age and gender together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's these curves and the curves</v>

107
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 1>are interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start off with men being more</v>

108
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:55.120
<v Speaker 1>optimistic than women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a convergence in midlife and</v>

109
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:55.931
<v Speaker 1>then a divergence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

110
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 1>we're metamor optimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic,</v>

111
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:00.070
<v Speaker 1>positivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher optimistic positivity than women,</v>

112
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see your race trends.</v>

113
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

114
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.070
<v Speaker 1>and those vary by cohort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People born before 1932 whites.</v>

115
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm more optimistic than blacks for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these people.</v>

116
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimism,</v>

117
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 1>optimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positivity declines with age,</v>

118
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're seeing these trends over time,</v>

119
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:23.140
<v Speaker 1>declining with age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whites and more optimistic than</v>

120
00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:27.370
<v Speaker 1>blocks and it's declining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for people born after 1932,</v>

121
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 1>we see blacks having higher levels of</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimists.</v>

122
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Dick Putz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these Americans,</v>

123
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

124
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>All US data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

125
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 1>high higher levels of optimistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>positivity than whites over the over age</v>

126
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are still declining.</v>

127
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.040
<v Speaker 1>That's optimistic positivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about a pessimistic negativity,</v>

128
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:47.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

129
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.110
<v Speaker 1>blacks consistently higher than whites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

130
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this past pessimistic negativity</v>

131
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.760
<v Speaker 1>across cohorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can look at those things and say,</v>

132
00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who got more schooling past high</v>

133
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 1>they were optimistic when we first</v>
<v Speaker 1>measured them and,</v>

135
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were more likely to get some</v>

136
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>schooling and we can try to control for</v>
<v Speaker 1>other things and say it's,</v>

137
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>it's really the optimism that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>influencing the schooling.</v>

138
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 1>We could also try to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.210
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their class background is influencing</v>

140
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 1>their optimism and pessimism and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

141
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 1>we have run better position to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about that.</v>

142
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>We can look at them over 25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have what you were born with.</v>

143
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have,</v>

144
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 1>when you started off with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

145
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 1>we do have what your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what income your parents made,</v>

146
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what school you,</v>

147
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much schooling you got and so forth.</v>

148
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about this was that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>really came of age.</v>

149
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I graduated high school in 1976 as the</v>

150
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.260
<v Speaker 1>great society programs were in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was really opportunity for people</v>

151
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 1>who base,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to some of the high,</v>

152
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that time it was called</v>

153
00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Slummerville.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leno wasn't very,</v>

154
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.040
<v Speaker 1>it's a place now that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

155
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 1>houses worth millions of dollars and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

156
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 1>But at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a working class neighborhood.</v>

157
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't a great students.</v>

158
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.530
<v Speaker 1>I got into university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did well in university because when we</v>

159
00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:15.650
<v Speaker 1>option I saw was joining the air force</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the Army and,</v>

160
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:16.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonprofit.</v>

161
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

162
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:23.111
<v Speaker 1>So I was thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>my career in the con and in terms of,</v>

163
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:27.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this project and the opportunities I've</v>

164
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:28.334
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>

165
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.140
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

166
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pessimistic person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I took advantage of the</v>

167
00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 1>opportunities because I saw that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were doors.</v>

168
00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:39.410
<v Speaker 1>The Way Society is structured is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's doors and if you can jump</v>

169
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:42.680
<v Speaker 1>through them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter what your skill</v>

170
00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that much,</v>

171
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.880
<v Speaker 1>their divisions are fine grained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can get through that door and</v>

172
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.330
<v Speaker 1>you get all sorts of resources and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna get to the next level.</v>

173
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.210
<v Speaker 1>So I became an optimistic about</v>
<v Speaker 1>academia,</v>

174
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:58.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that allowed me to continue to</v>

175
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:02.300
<v Speaker 1>put my nose to the grindstone and not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think too much about it because the</v>

176
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:03.800
<v Speaker 1>resources were there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

177
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.090
<v Speaker 1>I made the decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

178
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.670
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really the point I wanted to make</v>

179
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 1>was these policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these programs,</v>

180
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:14.831
<v Speaker 1>kids don't have them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now I teach and uh,</v>

181
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.190
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids see that the middle is getting</v>

182
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:19.910
<v Speaker 1>hollowed out.</v>

183
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're anxious.</v>

184
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Mental health problems and university</v>
<v Speaker 1>have gone through the roof,</v>

185
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.150
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

186
00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>university don't know how to do with it.</v>

187
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

188
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.920
<v Speaker 1>and I can see why they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the opportunities aren't there</v>

189
00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:38.870
<v Speaker 1>and the kids realize that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bifurcation,</v>

190
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:40.310
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a make it a break.</v>

191
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

192
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at myself,</v>

193
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:49.380
<v Speaker 1>I look at my own history and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

194
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.710
<v Speaker 1>I was the intel end of the baby boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

195
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 1>I profited economically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

196
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.770
<v Speaker 1>in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially in some ways,</v>

197
00:08:58.771 --> 00:08:59.670
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other ways,</v>

198
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:01.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

199
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.780
<v Speaker 1>and so I look at these generational</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences now and I can understand now</v>

200
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back to business,</v>

201
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:09.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going in,</v>

202
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.840
<v Speaker 1>somebody gets a job in the GIG economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

203
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.160
<v Speaker 1>What's their mentality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's another gig down the road.</v>

204
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 1>I'll make it work to the extent I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

205
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 1>or has it become like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this has to really work?</v>

206
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:24.450
<v Speaker 1>And if this doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm screwed.</v>

207
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My career,</v>

208
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody really knows</v>

209
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:31.020
<v Speaker 1>what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these areas that you're interested</v>

210
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 1>in terms of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

211
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.010
<v Speaker 1>and what the possibilities are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there,</v>

212
00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:37.260
<v Speaker 1>there's some interesting questions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to ask.</v>
