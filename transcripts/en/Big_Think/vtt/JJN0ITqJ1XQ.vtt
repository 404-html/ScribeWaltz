1
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.140
<v Speaker 1>We should not exaggerate at over Sweden</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are also and more and more</v>

2
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.460
<v Speaker 1>heterogeneous society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

3
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.070
<v Speaker 1>if American economists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>

4
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.960
<v Speaker 1>once you look around to see how how</v>
<v Speaker 1>other countries have fared and they've</v>

5
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>met the same global environment as</v>
<v Speaker 1>America has met,</v>

6
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.040
<v Speaker 1>then there might be some things to pick</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

7
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.950
<v Speaker 1>And we have been subject not to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>

8
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.960
<v Speaker 1>but to more intense competitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressures from new emerging economies.</v>

9
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.780
<v Speaker 1>We have not done your China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam,</v>

10
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.840
<v Speaker 1>India as new competitors compared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was there 15 or 20 years ago.</v>

11
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.380
<v Speaker 1>We also have next door Poland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Baltic republics,</v>

12
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Russia with a highly educated workforce</v>
<v Speaker 1>with very,</v>

13
00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>very low wages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps 10% of the wages paid in my</v>

14
00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:06.620
<v Speaker 1>country and the Rsa one hour away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

15
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.160
<v Speaker 1>So we have faced more intense</v>
<v Speaker 1>globalization</v>

16
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.290
<v Speaker 1>then the American economy and facing</v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less the same pressures.</v>

17
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.040
<v Speaker 1>We have increased employment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increased rate wages,</v>

18
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 1>also for blue collar workers were</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintained strong support for open</v>

19
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:29.480
<v Speaker 1>borders and we've been able to develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>our society.</v>

20
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are afraid of foreign</v>

21
00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:36.770
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real wages have declined.</v>

22
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Employment has not risen very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think to blame technological</v>

23
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:47.711
<v Speaker 1>change and globalization in the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States cannot be true if the same</v>

24
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>elements have led to a completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>different outcome in a country like</v>

25
00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:54.830
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my country is a small open economy</v>

26
00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.110
<v Speaker 1>with a very high level of education and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sophisticated social model.</v>

27
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I do not say that what we do can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed into an new American</v>

28
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.870
<v Speaker 1>modeling in 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

29
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:10.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please have a look and see what there is</v>

30
00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>the pickup of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.800
<v Speaker 1>of inspiration from a model that isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different but has stood the test of</v>

32
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:21.350
<v Speaker 1>globalization much better than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American model.</v>

33
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.860
<v Speaker 1>We continue to intensify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will affect more areas.</v>

34
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.200
<v Speaker 1>It will include more countries and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>each country it will include more and</v>

35
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:35.860
<v Speaker 1>more sectors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

36
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.460
<v Speaker 1>together with technological change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I believe is an underestimated</v>

37
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.870
<v Speaker 1>force behind the changes we have seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we are seeing together,</v>

38
00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:49.871
<v Speaker 1>they will continue to transform our</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries and the global economy.</v>

39
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.690
<v Speaker 1>Globalization to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means not only financial markets,</v>

40
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>not only trade in products like cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also means culture,</v>

41
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perception of the world,</v>

42
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should call it under the label</v>

44
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>that the world is shrinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Borders mean less.</v>

45
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>The Internet means that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate more and more people speak a</v>

46
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:20.970
<v Speaker 1>language where they can communicate with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in other parts of the,</v>

47
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the planet.</v>

48
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.960
<v Speaker 1>All these things together work to shrink</v>
<v Speaker 1>distances.</v>

49
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>And that is a much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much larger,</v>

50
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much wider concept and only interest</v>

51
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:38.160
<v Speaker 1>rates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shares and uh,</v>

52
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.500
<v Speaker 1>and physical goods moving around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
