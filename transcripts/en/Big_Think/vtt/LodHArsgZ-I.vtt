1
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about two years ago,</v>

2
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.160
<v Speaker 1>I stumbled on a piece of neuroscience</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just stunned me,</v>

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a psychologist,</v>

4
00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I wish somebody had told me more about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

5
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.160
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I learned is that there appears to</v>

6
00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:20.920
<v Speaker 1>be a part of our brain called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ventral striatum.</v>

7
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the technical term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you also could call it the seeking</v>

8
00:00:24.581 --> 00:00:29.581
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this system is urging us to explore</v>

9
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.570
<v Speaker 1>the boundaries of what we know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's urging us to be curious.</v>

10
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.670
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean innately,</v>

11
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean children's six months old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three months old,</v>

12
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.290
<v Speaker 1>if you give them some toy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love it for a little while is they</v>

13
00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:47.560
<v Speaker 1>get used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your car keys become more interesting.</v>

14
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.490
<v Speaker 1>It's the new and it's the desire to</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>

15
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.220
<v Speaker 1>And evolutionarily this system was</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed to help us to keep us</v>

16
00:00:57.221 --> 00:00:59.860
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I learned about this seeking</v>

17
00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:02.800
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really turned me on because it</v>

18
00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:07.801
<v Speaker 1>started to give me an insight into why</v>
<v Speaker 1>disengagement from boring work.</v>

19
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 1>That may not be a bug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be a feature on the 2015,</v>

20
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.690
<v Speaker 1>2016 Gallup polls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The evidence is that about 70 percent of</v>

21
00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:21.691
<v Speaker 1>people are not engaged in what they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>all day long and about 18 percent of</v>

22
00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:26.020
<v Speaker 1>people aren't repulsed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actively disengaged from what they</v>

23
00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:30.250
<v Speaker 1>do and I think that the reason why I say</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a problem and it could even be</v>

24
00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:35.251
<v Speaker 1>called an epidemic is because work is</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly what we do.</v>

25
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we spend so much more time at work than</v>

26
00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:41.740
<v Speaker 1>with our families and then those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>called hobbies and so I think that the</v>

27
00:01:41.741 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>pervasiveness of people feeling like</v>
<v Speaker 1>workers,</v>

28
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>a thing that we have to shut off from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that we can't be our best selves,</v>

29
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.870
<v Speaker 1>a thing that we have to get through on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to the weekend.</v>

30
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.050
<v Speaker 1>I think that that is a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanistic sickness and while it is bad</v>

31
00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:03.940
<v Speaker 1>for people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the humanistic bit.</v>

32
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.110
<v Speaker 1>It also is really bad for organizations</v>
<v Speaker 1>who get lackluster performance.</v>

33
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.680
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's interesting to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about when this all started happening</v>

34
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.860
<v Speaker 1>and you know I didn't live back in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 fifties,</v>

35
00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:19.861
<v Speaker 1>but all the records suggest that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could buy shoes and those shoes would be</v>

36
00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:22.990
<v Speaker 1>sold by some store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some cobbler,</v>

37
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.150
<v Speaker 1>and maybe there'll be three people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>work there.</v>

38
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Rarely would there be five people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>work there and while that probably</v>

39
00:02:29.771 --> 00:02:33.130
<v Speaker 1>wasn't the best work in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of the people in the store would</v>

40
00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:37.630
<v Speaker 1>watch the customer walk in and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd make a shoe for that customer and</v>

41
00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:42.310
<v Speaker 1>they take leather and they'd sew it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they give it in around $18 90.</v>

42
00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:46.780
<v Speaker 1>We got this different idea as a species</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we should not sell two pairs of</v>

43
00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:50.830
<v Speaker 1>shoes each day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 2 million and this idea of scaling</v>

44
00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:55.831
<v Speaker 1>up has certain implications for how work</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt and part of that was because it was</v>

45
00:02:56.501 --> 00:03:01.501
<v Speaker 1>decided that the way to do this but have</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme efficiency by breaking the work</v>

46
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>and a really small tasks were most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people don't meet the customer.</v>

47
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Most of the people don't invent the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoe.</v>

48
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Most of the people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually see the shoe made from</v>

49
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:17.521
<v Speaker 1>beginning to end and this idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>removing the meaning from the work</v>

50
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.040
<v Speaker 1>wasn't intentional and the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>removing the curiosity from the job was</v>

51
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>intentional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Henry Ford.</v>

52
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.480
<v Speaker 1>A curiosity was a bug that was a problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you needed to stamp it out in the</v>

53
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>name of reliability and quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not saying we're still acting</v>

54
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 1>just like the 19 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am saying that that's when we cut</v>

55
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 1>our teeth on management practices and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we use control systems and</v>

56
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:51.421
<v Speaker 1>punishments and extrinsic rewards to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of call people out into doing</v>

57
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.190
<v Speaker 1>really repeated and sometimes tedious</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasks again and again and again without</v>

58
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 1>having a sense of the bigger picture or</v>
<v Speaker 1>who uses the final product.</v>

59
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's part of where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>came from.</v>

60
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.130
<v Speaker 1>So a small organization in any industry</v>
<v Speaker 1>selling toner cartridges,</v>

61
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 1>selling fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>selling shoes.</v>

62
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 1>If you're just starting up and you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>only got 30 or 50 people working there,</v>

63
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 1>everybody is curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's doing everything.</v>

64
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 1>There aren't really tight role</v>
<v Speaker 1>descriptions.</v>

65
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 1>The job titles are not burned into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>flesh.</v>

66
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.310
<v Speaker 1>The frame of your job is not sacred and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you could be a delivery person,</v>

67
00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:37.600
<v Speaker 1>but then if you see the competitors or</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something,</v>

68
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 1>then you can be corporate espionage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take back information and then</v>

69
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:45.520
<v Speaker 1>you can get into strategy and help</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinvent a response to what you saw and</v>

70
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:48.940
<v Speaker 1>that's actually not only acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's desirable.</v>

71
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.010
<v Speaker 1>The CEO loves you for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get to have 50,000 people in an</v>

72
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to stay in your lane.</v>

73
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the expectation is there are a set of</v>

74
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Kpis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>key performance indices,</v>

75
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>and this is the way that we measure you</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your job and yeah,</v>

76
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:10.480
<v Speaker 1>it might be that you have ideas about</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive advantage and what the</v>

77
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 1>competitors are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no time for that because we</v>

78
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:15.730
<v Speaker 1>need you to do these things that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>already set aside for you.</v>

79
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think it's in my own opinion,</v>

80
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 1>a lot less about which industry and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot more about the culture and the</v>

81
00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 1>expectations for what different</v>
<v Speaker 1>employees can bring to the party.</v>
