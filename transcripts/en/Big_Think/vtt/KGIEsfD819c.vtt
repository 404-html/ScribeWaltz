00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>certain extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we have enp Islam and Martin</v>

<v Speaker 1>Mcguinness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool,</v>

18
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.230
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

19
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 1>managing</v>
<v Speaker 1>partners and a power sharing</v>

20
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>arrangement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

21
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 1>we used to have the USSR,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer there.</v>

22
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.970
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>W we,</v>

23
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.790
<v Speaker 1>we used to have a cold war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer there.</v>

24
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there aren't any certainties once,</v>

25
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>once shifts appear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm the things that I've learned and</v>

26
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

27
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>with grid conviction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people who respond to the</v>

28
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:50.751
<v Speaker 1>political conditions in which they live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to change our people to</v>

29
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>respond or think changed their</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>

30
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>don't try to attack their core values</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

31
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can obviously have your own view of</v>

32
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:01.860
<v Speaker 1>it and you can argue the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

33
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalism from whatever position I</v>

34
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>think is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a sensory wrong EPA and somebody has</v>

35
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>to inflect repression or injustice upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

37
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to change our human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>

38
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 1>respond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then changed the political conditions in</v>

39
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.060
<v Speaker 1>which they live.</v>
