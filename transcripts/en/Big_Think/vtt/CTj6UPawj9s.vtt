00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Can you go out in the streets in New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York and ask that question?</v>

2
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Younger people were pretty fired up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3
00:00:15.471 --> 00:00:16.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.470
<v Speaker 1>I've never been a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:18.471 --> 00:00:19.970
<v Speaker 1>bushes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the devil Kinda guy.</v>

6
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I really take offense at sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

7
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comparisons to totalitarianism.</v>

8
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Somebody sent me an email recently and</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared,</v>

9
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.780
<v Speaker 1>this administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was doing to what had been done</v>

11
00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:37.520
<v Speaker 1>in sort of communist the early years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the communist Soviet Union.</v>

12
00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:39.140
<v Speaker 1>And there was some comparison and I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote,</v>

13
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.260
<v Speaker 1>I write this people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I consider it my personal responsibility</v>

14
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:45.350
<v Speaker 1>as a journalist to write people back</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when they're praising me and being</v>

15
00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:46.990
<v Speaker 1>nice and I don't need the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.290
<v Speaker 1>to write people back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

17
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:50.390
<v Speaker 1>I have to reject this premise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not good.</v>

18
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Like there's nothing about this country</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

19
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.910
<v Speaker 1>That was true in the early years of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>communist Soviet Union.</v>

20
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say what you want about George W dot</v>

21
00:00:58.251 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is not stolen.</v>

22
00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:00.560
<v Speaker 1>So let's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>be ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having said that,</v>

24
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I think his legacy will be treated</v>
<v Speaker 1>harshly.</v>

25
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

26
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:08.900
<v Speaker 1>that's the majority of your book</v>
<v Speaker 1>reminded my reason if for no other</v>

27
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:10.550
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you took all the policies out of it,</v>

28
00:01:10.551 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>so you just took a rock out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say,</v>

29
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.270
<v Speaker 1>let's say a rock is not the defining a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing of his in a defining issue.</v>

30
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:19.520
<v Speaker 1>We think it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or let's say it's not foreign policy,</v>

31
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.460
<v Speaker 1>if for no other reason than he entered</v>
<v Speaker 1>office at a time of,</v>

32
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.800
<v Speaker 1>of incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paralyzing division in the country that</v>

33
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>he promised to amend it and that he made</v>
<v Speaker 1>it infinitely worse.</v>

34
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is his greatest disservice as a</v>

35
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That alone makes him a failed president,</v>

36
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.110
<v Speaker 1>if nothing else did in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.420
<v Speaker 1>because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he retarded the dialogue and the</v>

38
00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:44.210
<v Speaker 1>conversation in a country that</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperately needed to advance it.</v>

39
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>And for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think history will judge them harshly</v>

40
00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:48.200
<v Speaker 1>and whatever else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever else comes out of his</v>

42
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:51.680
<v Speaker 1>presidency will be judged beyond this.</v>
