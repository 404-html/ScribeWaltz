1
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.520
<v Speaker 1>We are the most self centered generation</v>
<v Speaker 1>in history,</v>

2
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>not just the the generation that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the baby boom generation before it</v>

3
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.570
<v Speaker 1>was brought up in the me generation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in society teaches.</v>

4
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.940
<v Speaker 1>It's all about me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every commercial says,</v>

5
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.580
<v Speaker 1>it's all about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do it all for you.</v>

6
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Have it your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You deserve it.</v>

7
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>I got to think of me first and we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught selfishness and that's why when I</v>

8
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>wrote purpose driven life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really a countercultural book</v>

9
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>because the very first sentence is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>exact opposite of our culture.</v>

10
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.860
<v Speaker 1>It says it's not about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's almost like a slap in the</v>

11
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

12
00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about you.</v>

13
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of things bigger in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world that simply your own happiness,</v>

14
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 1>your own fulfillment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a your own little selfish.</v>

15
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Claude have a life as George Bernard</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernard Shaw called it,</v>

16
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.400
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

17
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

18
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably high divorces.</v>

19
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.770
<v Speaker 1>People don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't been given good models.</v>

20
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Their parents often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're a good model of unselfishness.</v>

21
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it takes three to make a</v>

22
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>marriage work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it takes you,</v>

23
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it takes your spouse and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes God.</v>

24
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like a three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have a two legged stool,</v>

25
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Speaker 1>will fall over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One legged stool,</v>

26
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 1>will fall over two legged stool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you have you,</v>

27
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.490
<v Speaker 1>yourself and and your partner and God in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing,</v>

28
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.010
<v Speaker 1>it makes a triangle and as you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing closer to God and your spouse</v>

29
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>was growing closer to God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it automatically brings you together.</v>

30
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 1>My wife and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

31
00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 1>are extremely different from each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>in practically every single way,</v>

32
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>but as we grow closer to God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we grow closer to each other and it is</v>

33
00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:01.560
<v Speaker 1>the glue that has held us together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When every bone in my body wanted to</v>

34
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>give up on her body.</v>

35
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Now we actually made a commitment when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was till death do us part,</v>

36
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 1>and so we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to lock this gay patch,</v>

37
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>close it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and throw away the key.</v>

38
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those first two years when it was</v>

39
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:17.420
<v Speaker 1>hell on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really at.</v>

40
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>We started fighting on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the honeymoon,</v>

41
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 1>and we're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

42
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>I saved myself for this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a disappointment,</v>

43
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

44
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:27.421
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>we were fighting from the first day on</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we were immature and we didn't</v>

46
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:37.131
<v Speaker 1>know how to share and how adults learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as you grow through life,</v>

47
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you stay with a commitment,</v>

48
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>it really will get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

49
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>it's being willing to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being willing to reconcile a work.</v>

50
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Don't fix the blame fixtures.</v>
