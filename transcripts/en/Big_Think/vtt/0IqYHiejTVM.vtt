1
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Studies of children that we are born </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2
00:00:09.851 --> 00:00:14.200
<v Speaker 1>this instinct for what's called </v>
<v Speaker 1>substance dualism.</v>

3
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.400
<v Speaker 1>The idea that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body and the mind or soul,</v>

4
00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:21.940
<v Speaker 1>however you want to think of the psyche </v>
<v Speaker 1>are separate.</v>

5
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.553
<v Speaker 1>Children who are as young as three or </v>
<v Speaker 1>four years old who have not grown up </v>

6
00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:32.341
<v Speaker 1>with any kind of religious instruction </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally assume that they have a soul,</v>

7
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>and so I think a lot of theorists </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that this is this belief in the</v>

8
00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:44.011
<v Speaker 1>soul is universal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it can be traced back deep into our</v>

9
00:00:44.171 --> 00:00:45.550
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

10
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.490
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole host of reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

11
00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:51.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that if you're an unbeliever,</v>

12
00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 1>you think that it's just some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary accident.</v>

13
00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:58.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a trick of the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if as it were,</v>

14
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>that makes you think that you are an </v>
<v Speaker 1>immaterial being inside a material body.</v>

15
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.063
<v Speaker 1>If you're a believer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that it's probably because </v>

16
00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:09.154
<v Speaker 1>there is a soul and maybe perhaps that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were intentionally created in such a </v>

17
00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:19.321
<v Speaker 1>way as to think that there is more to us</v>
<v Speaker 1>than just the material realm.</v>

18
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.280
<v Speaker 1>It's really a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what cannot be denied is that belief</v>

19
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.173
<v Speaker 1>in the soul is a belief that all peoples</v>
<v Speaker 1>share regardless of their culture or </v>

20
00:01:31.151 --> 00:01:31.984
<v Speaker 1>their religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a belief that goes back as far </v>

21
00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:38.380
<v Speaker 1>back in time as we can possibly a trace </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

22
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.570
<v Speaker 1>And if these psychological studies that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about are right,</v>

23
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.780
<v Speaker 1>it's a belief that we're born with over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last couple of hundred years,</v>

24
00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:51.781
<v Speaker 1>there's been an enormous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that's gone into the question of</v>

25
00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:54.940
<v Speaker 1>why religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

26
00:01:54.941 --> 00:01:55.774
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that we all agree on is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that religion has been a part of the </v>

27
00:02:01.181 --> 00:02:04.090
<v Speaker 1>human experience from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

28
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>we can trace the origin of religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience to before homo sapiens.</v>

29
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.953
<v Speaker 1>We can check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can trace it with some measure of </v>

30
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:13.924
<v Speaker 1>confidence to neanderthals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can measure it with a little less </v>

31
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.340
<v Speaker 1>confidence all the way to homo erectus.</v>

32
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.173
<v Speaker 1>So we're talking hundreds of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years before our species even </v>

33
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.020
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is why?</v>

34
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if religion is a universal phenomenon or</v>

35
00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:36.610
<v Speaker 1>rather I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious experience.</v>

36
00:02:36.611 --> 00:02:40.060
<v Speaker 1>If religious experience is a universal </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon,</v>

37
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.200
<v Speaker 1>if it can be traced in all peoples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all cultures,</v>

38
00:02:44.201 --> 00:02:45.034
<v Speaker 1>and throughout all time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there must be some evolutionary </v>

39
00:02:48.611 --> 00:02:50.830
<v Speaker 1>reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There must be a reason,</v>

40
00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:51.664
<v Speaker 1>some adaptive advantage to having </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious experience or or faith </v>

41
00:02:57.641 --> 00:02:59.360
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.423
<v Speaker 1>otherwise it wouldn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there have been over the last </v>

43
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.883
<v Speaker 1>couple of centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>numerous attempts to figure out exactly </v>

44
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:12.571
<v Speaker 1>what that adaptive advantage would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most popular explanation of course,</v>

45
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.893
<v Speaker 1>is the sociological one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that religion creates a sense of </v>

46
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.140
<v Speaker 1>cohesion amongst a group and that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of cohesion,</v>

47
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.973
<v Speaker 1>the idea that we could come together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>create a collective identity based on </v>

48
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.463
<v Speaker 1>shared symbols or shared metaphors gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>an adaptive advantage to believing </v>

49
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>communities that nonbelievers </v>
<v Speaker 1>communities did not have.</v>

50
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.713
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty good answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that religion is as much </v>

51
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>a divisive issue as it is a cohesive </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

52
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 1>It says a good at creating outgroups as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is in groups,</v>

53
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 1>and more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that,</v>

54
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.303
<v Speaker 1>the social cohesion theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a kinship was a much more </v>

55
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:07.741
<v Speaker 1>powerful and much more dominant form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>social cohesion than religion was.</v>

56
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Our ancestors lived in small communities</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were bound together by,</v>

57
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.410
<v Speaker 1>by blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by relationship,</v>

58
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:18.580
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by kinship,</v>

59
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.880
<v Speaker 1>a long before they created symbols and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythologies in order to unify them.</v>

60
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 1>So it's a pretty good answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really,</v>

61
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.060
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really explain what adaptive </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage religion would have had.</v>

62
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Others have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

63
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:38.590
<v Speaker 1>it's about giving us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.453
<v Speaker 1>answers to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unanswerable questions of the world </v>

65
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:47.150
<v Speaker 1>that what it did was create a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

66
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.343
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge about the universe that </v>

67
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 1>lessened anxiety in some way.</v>

68
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was an adaptive advantage.</v>

69
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if that were true and there's truly</v>

70
00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 1>no reason scientifically to think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

71
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.423
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to make an argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>about why that would necessarily be an </v>

72
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:06.604
<v Speaker 1>adaptive advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly because religion actually </v>

73
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>causes far more anxiety than it lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

74
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.903
<v Speaker 1>to put it in evolutionary terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cost of religious expression is </v>

75
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 1>enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's enormous in terms of time.</v>

76
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 1>It's enormous in terms of the cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>processes that are involved in it.</v>

77
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

78
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.443
<v Speaker 1>it sort of creates greater anxiety when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel as though your actions have </v>

79
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:41.611
<v Speaker 1>cosmic significance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this is to say that the countless</v>

80
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:47.341
<v Speaker 1>different answers that have been given </v>
<v Speaker 1>for why religion fail,</v>

81
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.993
<v Speaker 1>primarily because they're functionalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>answers what they primarily say is what </v>

82
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:57.220
<v Speaker 1>religion does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not why religion exists,</v>

83
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.053
<v Speaker 1>and so a group of cognitive scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly cognitive scientists who </v>

84
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:07.931
<v Speaker 1>focus on religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have tried to look to a different way of</v>

85
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:09.794
<v Speaker 1>answering this question of why religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they've discovered is that </v>

86
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is in the end,</v>

87
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 1>no adaptive advantage to religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith.</v>

88
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>And number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the reason that religion exists,</v>

89
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 1>it's big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because it is an accidental byproduct</v>

90
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.333
<v Speaker 1>of some other adaptive advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here we get into very complicated </v>

91
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:41.411
<v Speaker 1>conversations about cognitive theory and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the development of our frontal lobes and</v>

92
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to put it in its simplest way,</v>

93
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.050
<v Speaker 1>religious thinking is embedded in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive processes.</v>

94
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.460
<v Speaker 1>It is a mode of knowing we're born with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

95
00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.890
<v Speaker 1>It's part of our DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question then becomes why.</v>

96
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 1>One answer is that there is no why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just simply an accident of other,</v>

97
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:08.300
<v Speaker 1>much more important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more necessary,</v>

98
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive,</v>

99
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptions,</v>

100
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptations I should say.</v>

101
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if you're a believer,</v>

102
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.893
<v Speaker 1>you would say because we were made that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way because we are designed to believe </v>

103
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:28.160
<v Speaker 1>that there is more to this world than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the material realm,</v>

104
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.090
<v Speaker 1>that that mode of knowing that exists in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our brain is there for a reason.</v>

105
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Either answer is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some people who say,</v>

106
00:07:35.931 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what religion really does and the reason</v>

107
00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 1>that it exists is that it creates some </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality,</v>

108
00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:42.464
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

109
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we,</v>

110
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Speaker 1>if we imagine that there's this absolute</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral law giver,</v>

111
00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:49.760
<v Speaker 1>then we're less likely to kill our </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbor.</v>

112
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:52.640
<v Speaker 1>And that creates some sort of adaptive </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>

113
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that theory of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the concept of a moral law giver</v>

114
00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:58.933
<v Speaker 1>is barely 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old and religious expression goes </v>

115
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.130
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

116
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 1>if you even think about the Mesopotamian</v>
<v Speaker 1>gods or the Egyptian gods,</v>

117
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:11.150
<v Speaker 1>and this is against seven or 8,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

118
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.390
<v Speaker 1>these were not moral beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the contrary,</v>

119
00:08:14.391 --> 00:08:19.030
<v Speaker 1>they were amoral and often immoral </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

120
00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:24.031
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that religion is about </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality is a very new idea.</v>

121
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Others say that religion is about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>

122
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:29.714
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a way of maintaining control and </v>

123
00:08:31.251 --> 00:08:32.084
<v Speaker 1>power over a group and perhaps those </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups that were religiously inclined </v>

124
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.450
<v Speaker 1>had an adaptive advantage because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion of an authority structure allowed</v>

125
00:08:44.221 --> 00:08:45.440
<v Speaker 1>them to survive better.</v>

126
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty good answer.</v>

127
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:47.923
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you're talking about </v>

128
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:54.460
<v Speaker 1>institutionalized religious expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which maybe maybe it's 12 to 14,000</v>

129
00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:58.680
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

130
00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.573
<v Speaker 1>that's as far back as we can trace </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that looks like an </v>

131
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 1>institutional religious authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

132
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:08.363
<v Speaker 1>that does not explain why religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed hundreds of thousands of years </v>

133
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:15.660
<v Speaker 1>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth of the matter is we just don't</v>

134
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.673
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is a fact is that there is </v>

135
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:21.024
<v Speaker 1>something in the way that our brains </v>
<v Speaker 1>work that compel us to believe that we </v>

136
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:31.890
<v Speaker 1>are more than just the sum of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>material parts.</v>

137
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.383
<v Speaker 1>That thing is either an echo or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>accident or it's deliberate and </v>

138
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:39.354
<v Speaker 1>purposeful and which you decide is </v>
<v Speaker 1>purely a matter of choice because there </v>

139
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:47.610
<v Speaker 1>is no proof either way.</v>
