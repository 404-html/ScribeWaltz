1
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.780
<v Speaker 1>That's hard for me to predict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that this is a topic that to</v>

2
00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Michael Claire and other people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>promoted as the idea that we're going to</v>

3
00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:16.180
<v Speaker 1>fight over water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil,</v>

4
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.780
<v Speaker 1>a timber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you name it.</v>

5
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I see is a,</v>

6
00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:23.390
<v Speaker 1>is a world becoming more interdependent</v>
<v Speaker 1>in everything.</v>

7
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.000
<v Speaker 1>My book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thesis of my book Gusher of lies is</v>

8
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.510
<v Speaker 1>really that the world is interdependent</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any number of commodities,</v>

9
00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:32.480
<v Speaker 1>whether it's ipods or beer or fresh</v>
<v Speaker 1>flowers,</v>

10
00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.820
<v Speaker 1>tennis shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that interdependence is going to</v>

11
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:39.710
<v Speaker 1>strengthen actually in the coming years</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we have no choice as different</v>

12
00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:40.760
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

13
00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Countries become better at producing</v>

14
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:46.400
<v Speaker 1>certain commodities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will assert their influence in the</v>

15
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.270
<v Speaker 1>marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my book debunks the idea that energy</v>

16
00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:53.960
<v Speaker 1>independence as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's doable or even desirable for</v>

17
00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:55.850
<v Speaker 1>the US.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we really need to be looking at is</v>

18
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.900
<v Speaker 1>interdependence.</v>

19
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is in fact what the market and</v>

20
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>energy and other commodities has had</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

21
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.870
<v Speaker 1>for decades and will continue to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

22
00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:04.460
<v Speaker 1>There clearly is a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.060
<v Speaker 1>of rhetoric about the issue of oil and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting over oil.</v>

24
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:11.990
<v Speaker 1>I think what I see in the future as</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural gas becomes a more critical</v>

25
00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:14.360
<v Speaker 1>player in the global economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a,</v>

26
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.300
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more of a bind necessity.</v>

27
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:22.301
<v Speaker 1>It is a much more cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Commercial enterprise pipelines require</v>

28
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 1>a stronger connections between</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

29
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and gas really is only effectively moved</v>

30
00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:29.720
<v Speaker 1>in at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 1>by gas pipeline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to see on an emerging gas</v>

32
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.340
<v Speaker 1>market that has global due to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing use of liquified natural gas</v>

33
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:40.430
<v Speaker 1>and I think compressed natural gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not in the market yet,</v>

34
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any significant degree,</v>

35
00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:43.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in the marine market.</v>

36
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.040
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

37
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.460
<v Speaker 1>I think I would argue the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I think as the world gets a more</v>

38
00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 1>integrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the market for energy gets more</v>

39
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:53.900
<v Speaker 1>integrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we're going to see a</v>

40
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.410
<v Speaker 1>further cooperation among countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it is in their commercial</v>

41
00:01:57.411 --> 00:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

42
00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:00.650
<v Speaker 1>if you look at what has happened with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

43
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your ran,</v>

44
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.880
<v Speaker 1>despite America's efforts to isolate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iranians,</v>

45
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.790
<v Speaker 1>what we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact seeing as the Iranians making</v>

46
00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:10.970
<v Speaker 1>multiple commercial deals with numerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries around the world,</v>

47
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the Brazilians,</v>

48
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.490
<v Speaker 1>the Turks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Austrians,</v>

49
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.450
<v Speaker 1>the Iranians are integrating their</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy and their energy commodities</v>

50
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.940
<v Speaker 1>into the global economy and doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>very effectively.</v>
