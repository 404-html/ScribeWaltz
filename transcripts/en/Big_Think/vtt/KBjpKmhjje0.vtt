1
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.610
<v Speaker 1>In order to transform a company into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable organization in terms of</v>

2
00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:18.500
<v Speaker 1>both commitment and performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leaders have to approach their job,</v>

3
00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 1>the CEO's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top management of key people,</v>

4
00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:24.590
<v Speaker 1>of business units and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to approach their job in a way</v>

5
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:25.790
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.350
<v Speaker 1>that engages the organization in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning process.</v>

7
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.791
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

8
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:36.680
<v Speaker 1>they see the problem of organization</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance as a problem of learning</v>

9
00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:39.440
<v Speaker 1>both for the work for themselves and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the organization.</v>

10
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these leaders,</v>

11
00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:45.170
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connect authentically with people.</v>

12
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.390
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do they connect authentically with</v>

13
00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:50.810
<v Speaker 1>people by being much more revealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>about themselves?</v>

14
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a CEO took over a company,</v>

15
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.433
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a restaurant company,</v>

18
00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>first management meeting spoke not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what the firm needed to do,</v>

20
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:08.330
<v Speaker 1>but about where he was coming from and</v>
<v Speaker 1>its own life experience had to do a lot</v>

21
00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:10.760
<v Speaker 1>with his father and the values that his</v>
<v Speaker 1>father had.</v>

22
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revealing those things about himself and</v>

23
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:18.101
<v Speaker 1>who he or she might be is a critical</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of engaging people in an authentic</v>

24
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:23.210
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second element of leadership is that</v>

25
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:28.211
<v Speaker 1>these leaders have to have the will to</v>
<v Speaker 1>an to essentially change the system,</v>

26
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.530
<v Speaker 1>change and transform the company around</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

27
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.710
<v Speaker 1>around the kind of philosophy and values</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about.</v>

28
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and around the business idea that's</v>

29
00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:42.620
<v Speaker 1>going to drive the business model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to drive the organization</v>

30
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>to better performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to have a clear vision of</v>

31
00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:47.510
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they develop that vision on their</v>

32
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:48.111
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

33
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

34
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.300
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bring it,</v>

35
00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:53.270
<v Speaker 1>bring a lot of that with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as far as the business aspects,</v>

36
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 1>they have to figure that out when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get into the firm.</v>

37
00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.220
<v Speaker 1>But they have to have the will to</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially articulated and push for it.</v>

38
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were to stop here,</v>

39
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.940
<v Speaker 1>you could also say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

40
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:08.660
<v Speaker 1>that can lead to autocratic management,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not what high commitment,</v>

41
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:09.980
<v Speaker 1>high performance firms are.</v>

42
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the next dimension of effective</v>

43
00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:15.290
<v Speaker 1>leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that high commitment,</v>

44
00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:18.920
<v Speaker 1>high performance leaders have is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>willingness to inquire,</v>

45
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.240
<v Speaker 1>the willingness to state boldly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want and what they think they need</v>

46
00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:24.950
<v Speaker 1>to do and what the firm ought to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

47
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.630
<v Speaker 1>And why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also the willingness to inquire from</v>

48
00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:33.470
<v Speaker 1>their own senior team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the organization as a whole,</v>

49
00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:37.370
<v Speaker 1>from people at various levels in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization about whether the direction</v>

50
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:41.010
<v Speaker 1>makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether what they see as what,</v>

51
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.000
<v Speaker 1>what people in the organization she as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they as the strengths of the</v>

52
00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:46.400
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also what they see as the barriers</v>

53
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.170
<v Speaker 1>to achieving sustainable performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

54
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.370
<v Speaker 1>and that enables them to learn the truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the character of the company and</v>

55
00:02:57.681 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>how it's functioning to the create</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainability.</v>

56
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn about yourself as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>leader and not necessarily you as a</v>

57
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>person only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also your ideas,</v>

58
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>your strategic ideas about what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do and whether in a business</v>

59
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>policies you promote that.</v>

60
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not able to up,</v>

61
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.730
<v Speaker 1>if you're not able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 1>obtain that feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are likely to not be able to get off</v>

63
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.240
<v Speaker 1>a path that you may have to get off of</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

64
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 1>to sustain the performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>over long periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability to inquire and obtain</v>

66
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>feedback and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be vulnerable to obtain feedback is</v>

67
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>a critical characteristic of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of high commitment,</v>

68
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 1>high performance leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

69
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:42.691
<v Speaker 1>this has been described in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the less operational way as people</v>

70
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 1>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These leaders are humble.</v>

71
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 1>They have humility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't assume they are doing it</v>

72
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They involve others.</v>

73
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 1>They ask questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to work on a problem solving.</v>

74
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>
