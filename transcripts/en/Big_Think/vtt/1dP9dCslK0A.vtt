1
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.870
<v Speaker 1>You'll have to acknowledge that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare was a little,</v>

2
00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>one of the primary inventors of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language we use today.</v>

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>He was a fountainhead of phrases and </v>
<v Speaker 1>words and so on.</v>

4
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Then we now take for granted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>of course the other great shaper of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>language languages,</v>

6
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.680
<v Speaker 1>the King James version of the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has a poultry vocabulary compared</v>

8
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:28.491
<v Speaker 1>with the Shakespeare's fountain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>explosive found in other words.</v>

9
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he did,</v>

10
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of,</v>

11
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just giving us the means to communicate.</v>

12
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a godfather.</v>

13
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he is acknowledged as one of the</v>

14
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:49.420
<v Speaker 1>greatest dramatists ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that the Russians claim him the</v>

15
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans or whatever,</v>

16
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not English or American.</v>

17
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>He is this universal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a playwright speaking,</v>

18
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>invoicing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary truths because he seems to</v>

19
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>have the finger on the pulse of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes people tick.</v>

20
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fascinated by the human condition.</v>

21
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet you have to put it back.</v>

22
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>He was also in a writing plays for </v>
<v Speaker 1>actors to perform.</v>

23
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.550
<v Speaker 1>And so the formula is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>he's extraordinary because he's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same play that he can,</v>

25
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people who are maybe a little more </v>

26
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 1>educated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the essays,</v>

27
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:36.804
<v Speaker 1>have bacon in the park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pocket's going to wash a shakespeare </v>

28
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will get this wonderful existential</v>

29
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:45.190
<v Speaker 1>examination of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>what is man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's the point,</v>

31
00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:48.690
<v Speaker 1>where are we going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

32
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.950
<v Speaker 1>what his death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>all these wonderful issues in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>play that an ignorant,</v>

35
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.563
<v Speaker 1>uneducated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a citizen can pay as penny stand in the </v>

36
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:01.194
<v Speaker 1>rain and watch a play about armies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>witches and poisonings and revenge and </v>

37
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He absolutely gets his money's worth.</v>

38
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>So he's has this wonderful ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to encompass all these interests.</v>

39
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.593
<v Speaker 1>I think for the actor also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is one of the most generous of </v>

40
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:21.070
<v Speaker 1>authors because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

41
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want you to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to,</v>

42
00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.453
<v Speaker 1>what the author intended because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>never quite sure with shakespeare what </v>

44
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>he intends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sort of supplies great situations,</v>

45
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wants your collaboration.</v>

46
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>He wants your input.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

47
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.090
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

48
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

49
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.410
<v Speaker 1>it's always a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 1>teamwork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

51
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:46.494
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a definitive thing that you </v>

52
00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:52.170
<v Speaker 1>have to do that makes it a shakespeare </v>
<v Speaker 1>in performance or Shakespeare and hamlet</v>

53
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 1>and it's not what he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

54
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:55.014
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason why he's endured for </v>
<v Speaker 1>so long and why every country sees him </v>

55
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:07.021
<v Speaker 1>as the playwright and Whitefield go on </v>
<v Speaker 1>being performed because he's,</v>

56
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

57
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:09.334
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's language has changed over the </v>

58
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

59
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he's all his,</v>

60
00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:16.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.090
<v Speaker 1>the phrases that you use or they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretentious and highfaluting and poetic,</v>

62
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.660
<v Speaker 1>that the imagery is all from chairs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tables and glasses and whatever.</v>

63
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>The things that can people relate to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't talk in a self conscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>poetic terms.</v>

65
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Because he was being made an academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject which he would have hated.</v>

67
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.373
<v Speaker 1>But once you get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the class was made to perform a play </v>

68
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.240
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.560
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to actually,</v>

70
00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:53.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.270
<v Speaker 1>inhabit the roles and make them live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you get behind it,</v>

72
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.590
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And kids get Shakespeare.</v>

73
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

74
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very,</v>

75
00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:04.710
<v Speaker 1>very user friendly.</v>

76
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.130
<v Speaker 2>I think if you're a young person</v>

77
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>growing up a adolescent and you play </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hamlet,</v>

78
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.883
<v Speaker 1>I'm there all sorts of things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>relate to and it's all about </v>

79
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:23.590
<v Speaker 1>relationships with parents and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>loyalties and friends,</v>

80
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:24.800
<v Speaker 1>school friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it all about,</v>

82
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

83
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

84
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>in relationships with women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

85
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of things that relate to.</v>

86
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing about Shakespeare is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the language is very,</v>

87
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.130
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy to learn in a way because</v>

88
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.473
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare was a genius and he </v>

89
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.140
<v Speaker 1>constructs language in such a way that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>inhabits an actor's mind very </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortably.</v>

91
00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.793
<v Speaker 1>And by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to unlearn because </v>

92
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm rattles around and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it sort of fertilizers the language.</v>

93
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 1>You find yourself speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.210
<v Speaker 1>using shakespeare and phrases all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

95
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.760
<v Speaker 2>I come from a British group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a</v>

96
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.773
<v Speaker 1>tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think no British actor considers </v>

97
00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:27.900
<v Speaker 1>himself a true actor unless he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare under his belt.</v>

98
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Not just because it's a but because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a practical thing,</v>

99
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.500
<v Speaker 1>but he is the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

100
00:05:37.501 --> 00:05:38.550
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:05:38.551 --> 00:05:40.380
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you perform shakespeare,</v>

102
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.243
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn great things about breath </v>

103
00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:45.900
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

104
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.950
<v Speaker 1>and I think he is so often misunderstood</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country,</v>

105
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.043
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the method tradition is very </v>

106
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:55.740
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

107
00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>this especially in movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic for movies,</v>

108
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.000
<v Speaker 1>useless for Shakespeare because so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>actors feel that they are to a,</v>

109
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 1>instead of just playing the role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 1>the best acting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm less than is there.</v>

111
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>And Hamlet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

112
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.323
<v Speaker 1>at the mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather cheeky prince tells these </v>

113
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 1>professional actors how they should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they should perform this play.</v>

115
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.463
<v Speaker 1>And it's really behind hamlet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Shakespeare imploring actors for </v>

116
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 1>this new style.</v>

117
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.560
<v Speaker 1>But he's creating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

118
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 1>speak the speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pray you as I pronounced it to you,</v>

119
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:31.603
<v Speaker 1>trippingly on the tongue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you over it as many of your </v>

120
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:37.520
<v Speaker 1>players do I have this leaf.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's but use all gently be not to tame</v>

123
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:45.194
<v Speaker 1>neither,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let your own discretion be your </v>

124

<v Speaker 1>tutors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sued the reaction to the word,</v>

125
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 1>the word to the action with this special</v>
<v Speaker 1>observance,</v>

126
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 1>that step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the modesty of nature for anything.</v>

127
00:06:57.261 --> 00:06:57.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

128
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.543
<v Speaker 1>don is from the purpose of playing who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>an both of the fest and now was and is </v>

00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:13.160
<v Speaker 1>own image and the very age and body of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

131
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.640
<v Speaker 1>his form and pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes on a bit.</v>

132
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else do you need?</v>

133
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.063
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

134
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.680
<v Speaker 1>it's a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we better off if we know exactly who</v>

135
00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:30.514
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we to accept this stratfordian </v>

136
00:07:32.981 --> 00:07:36.190
<v Speaker 1>candidate who for my money is a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlikely?</v>

137
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.500
<v Speaker 1>There's a man who could barely write his</v>
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>

138
00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:40.240
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose wife was illiterate,</v>

139
00:07:40.241 --> 00:07:43.780
<v Speaker 1>who own notebooks and nothing was spoken</v>
<v Speaker 1>about him in his lifetime.</v>

140
00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:46.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems that William Shrugs,</v>

141
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.950
<v Speaker 1>pair of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

145
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.193
<v Speaker 1>I'm my own feeling as a candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earl of Oxford airport to veer is </v>

146
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.990
<v Speaker 1>highly plausible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the smoking gun that will link him,</v>

147
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:16.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas a lot of evidence but are way </v>
