1
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Peaceful rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is to say China's goal is to work</v>

2
00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:14.170
<v Speaker 1>out the enormous internal contradictions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the country,</v>

3
00:00:14.171 --> 00:00:17.290
<v Speaker 1>the growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous growth of wealth in urban</v>

4
00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:19.870
<v Speaker 1>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous impoverishment and immobility</v>

5
00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:23.560
<v Speaker 1>and rural areas and the fear of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>political explosion that could cause</v>

6
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.630
<v Speaker 1>China's goal was to work that stuff out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a quiet setting as possible.</v>

7
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to cause international</v>
<v Speaker 1>upset.</v>

8
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.530
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to get into public</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights with the United States or anybody</v>

9
00:00:35.531 --> 00:00:37.600
<v Speaker 1>else for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

10
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.560
<v Speaker 1>their political values are profoundly</v>
<v Speaker 1>different from ours.</v>

11
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we can have much</v>
<v Speaker 1>expectation of China changing China's</v>

12
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:48.190
<v Speaker 1>internal political culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I think is a really complicated</v>

13
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:50.590
<v Speaker 1>challenge though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that China,</v>

14
00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:54.220
<v Speaker 1>much more than Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a kind of exportable model.</v>

15
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.380
<v Speaker 1>That is to say they too have something</v>
<v Speaker 1>to promote,</v>

16
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's not democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's it's capitalist,</v>

17
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.770
<v Speaker 1>it's autocratic capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia doesn't feel that way because it</v>

18
00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.100
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to have a system.</v>

19
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Where they have is a lot of oil which</v>
<v Speaker 1>just keeps their coffers refilled.</v>

20
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.680
<v Speaker 1>China has no such an inherent advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China has figured out a means of</v>

21
00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:15.580
<v Speaker 1>economic and social and political</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization whereby they can be an</v>

22
00:01:15.581 --> 00:01:19.960
<v Speaker 1>incredible economic dynamo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but keep a lid on politically.</v>

23
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is of course a tremendously</v>

24
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.660
<v Speaker 1>appealing model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're an autocrat in some</v>

25
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.230
<v Speaker 1>impoverished third world country and</v>
<v Speaker 1>China goes around the world,</v>

26
00:01:29.231 --> 00:01:33.070
<v Speaker 1>especially to resource rich countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and offers to kind of deal,</v>

27
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.110
<v Speaker 1>you allow us to have a lock on your oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of your oil,</v>

28
00:01:38.111 --> 00:01:41.080
<v Speaker 1>so we have a guaranteed amount at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed price.</v>

29
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.640
<v Speaker 1>We in turn will give you concessional</v>
<v Speaker 1>loans and grants.</v>

30
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>You in turn will use those funds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn around and pay Chinese construction</v>

31
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:54.460
<v Speaker 1>and engineering companies to build your</v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure.</v>

32
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a great deal from the point of view</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the recipient countries.</v>

33
00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:03.181
<v Speaker 1>The only problem is that it cements in</v>
<v Speaker 1>place these authoritarian political</v>

34
00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:07.330
<v Speaker 1>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's a problem for the west,</v>

35
00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:10.570
<v Speaker 1>not just for the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for other donors,</v>

36
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.850
<v Speaker 1>for institutions like the World Bank and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the IMF.</v>

37
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.950
<v Speaker 1>How do we come up with a sufficiently</v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing,</v>

38
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.010
<v Speaker 2>countable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's an ongoing problem.</v>
