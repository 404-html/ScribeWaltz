00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.900
<v Speaker 1>I do think that behavior has improved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>at least on the margin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not more.</v>

3
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>So we haven't seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>it's funny for all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>financial destruction in the markets</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have taken place.</v>

6
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

7
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Speaker 1>this has been a period where we had not</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen people,</v>

8
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

9
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get taken away in handcuffs,</v>

10
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be on Wall Street or</v>

11
00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

12
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 1>occasionally you hear about an insider</v>
<v Speaker 1>trading ring or you know,</v>

13
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>a one off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually some mom and pop in</v>

14
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Czechoslovakia that seemed to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>taken out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken away,</v>

16
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.930
<v Speaker 1>but you haven't heard of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of big time CEO's and a lot of trouble.</v>

17
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do think that one of the,</v>

18
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.570
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that was going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the Enron period and why</v>

19
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:45.480
<v Speaker 1>prosecutors were as harsh as they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know a lot of people thought they</v>

20
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:47.170
<v Speaker 1>were too harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 1>was that they were really thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deterrence factor.</v>

22
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>And at least so far now we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>short memories on Wall Street,</v>

23
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.060
<v Speaker 1>at least so far it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.480
<v Speaker 1>as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything comes in cycles.</v>

25
00:00:57.481 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>And I can't imagine we won't do this all</v>
<v Speaker 1>again anyway.</v>
