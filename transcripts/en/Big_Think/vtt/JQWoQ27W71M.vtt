1
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 2>Noncommunicable diseases are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases that you and I are most</v>

3
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 2>familiar with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are things like diabetes and heart</v>

4
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:21.561
<v Speaker 2>disease and unfortunately I think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you run your hand over the planet,</v>

5
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 2>you'll see that in the poorest countries</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's extremely little that's being</v>

6
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 2>done across these dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These diseases are not getting the</v>

7
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:36.111
<v Speaker 2>attention that they deserve and yet they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are becoming a larger and larger piece</v>

8
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 2>of the puzzle of public health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in Rwanda and Kenya and Ethiopia and</v>

9
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 2>a number of countries where I've worked</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the years,</v>

10
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 2>we've seen large numbers of new type one</v>
<v Speaker 2>and type two diabetes coming through the</v>

11
00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:51.120
<v Speaker 2>door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a couple months ago,</v>

12
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:56.121
<v Speaker 2>I was out at a health center where a man</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was suffering with type one diabetes</v>

13
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.280
<v Speaker 2>was actually living at the health center</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he didn't have the authority to</v>

14
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 2>provide himself with daily injections of</v>
<v Speaker 2>insulin.</v>

15
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this would never happen in the u s or in</v>

16
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 2>a rich country.</v>

17
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 2>He'd get his needles and he'd get his</v>
<v Speaker 2>insulin and he'd be able to inject</v>

18
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 2>himself at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But where there is care that's given,</v>

19
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 2>it's given without very much instruction</v>
<v Speaker 2>or very much knowledge of these</v>

20
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 2>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the perhaps best interventions</v>

21
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 2>that we can make as a world today in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>area of public health is around these</v>

22
00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 2>noncommunicable diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've actually got to start taking a</v>

23
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 2>look at heart disease and poor</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>

24
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.920
<v Speaker 2>I know that in China for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart disease has become one of the top</v>

25
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:40.680
<v Speaker 2>killers in Rwanda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in sub Saharan Africa.</v>

26
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart disease is a major killer,</v>

27
00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 2>but it's a bit of a silent killer</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people haven't attracted over</v>

28
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 2>the years it hasn't been as interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor has it attracted as much donor</v>

29
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 2>dollars as something like aids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tuberculosis or malaria.</v>

30
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 2>And yet it's still claiming a huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of lives and a lot of</v>

31
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 2>productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though we don't have the best of</v>

32
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 2>baseline data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do know that the impact is enormous,</v>

33
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:08.100
<v Speaker 2>and we know that with changing diets and</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor countries with urbanization,</v>

34
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.220
<v Speaker 2>with increase in smoking and basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad rich country habits,</v>

35
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 2>people are going to be getting sicker</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sicker earlier and earlier,</v>

36
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 2>and now is the time to really prevent</v>
<v Speaker 2>this disease,</v>

37
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:24.570
<v Speaker 2>which is going to be the next wave of</v>
<v Speaker 2>pandemic that hits the way</v>

38
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.620
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
