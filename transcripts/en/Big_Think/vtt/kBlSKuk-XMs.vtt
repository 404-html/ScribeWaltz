1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I've read</v>

3
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 2>it sounds really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I was about 10 or 11,</v>

4
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.730
<v Speaker 2>I stumbled across the Elliot at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My father had bought the great books of</v>

5
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 2>the Western world and one of the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>books,</v>

6
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:28.410
<v Speaker 2>it was the Elian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what it was,</v>

7
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 2>but it was a very long thing and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought this is the beginning of</v>

8
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 2>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to read this and I</v>

9
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 2>understood probably about half of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was fascinating.</v>

10
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 2>It was an incredibly tense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an interesting story.</v>

11
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.020
<v Speaker 2>And once I got into the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>way that the,</v>

12
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.600
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

13
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 2>the poems worked it with like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a swash buckling mystery in a way.</v>

14
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 2>So that made me feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gosh,</v>

15
00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 2>this is exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to do that too.</v>

16
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 2>The one that I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote poems before this,</v>

17
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 2>but the one that I consider the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>real poem was about that time too.</v>

18
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 2>It was an Easter poem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

19
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 2>it's in school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were supposed to write,</v>

20
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.950
<v Speaker 2>write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or paint or do something artistic for</v>

21
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 2>Easter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wrote this poem called the rabbit</v>

22
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 2>with the droopy ear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember it because when I began</v>

23
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 2>writing the poem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea how it was going to end.</v>

24
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 2>I just had this idea of a rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Easter bunny,</v>

25
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 2>who had one ear that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drooped down and he was distressed.</v>

26
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 2>So I kept writing and it rhymed and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

27
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 2>And it was actually the rhyme itself</v>
<v Speaker 2>that helped me solve the problem of a</v>

28
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 2>rabbit with the droopy year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the end of the poem goes hip,</v>

29
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:47.221
<v Speaker 2>hip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurray,</v>

30
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 2>let's toast the cup for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both ears were hanging up.</v>

31
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 2>He hanged himself from a tree and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>ears hang straight and everybody's</v>

32
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 2>cheering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just,</v>

33
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very exciting to find that.</v>

34
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 2>And I actually had to read it aloud in</v>
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>

35
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was another thing.</v>

36
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 2>Castles were the days when you did these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things in class.</v>

37
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:11.240
<v Speaker 2>But now people showed their paintings if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had something from eastern.</v>

38
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 2>I had to read my poem aloud them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people liked it.</v>

39
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 2>The kids liked my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was an instant success story.</v>

40
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.900
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't totally changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's changed in the sense that,</v>

41
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 2>that it's to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

42
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.150
<v Speaker 2>let's say that the goal is not to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>to some kind of neat solution as that</v>

43
00:02:37.521 --> 00:02:38.950
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

44
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.410
<v Speaker 2>but it hasn't changed in the sense that</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some level I'm never quite sure how</v>

45
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:51.341
<v Speaker 2>the poem is going to resolve itself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm always in some way surprised.</v>

46
00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:57.320
<v Speaker 2>I make a discovery in a poem once I</v>
<v Speaker 2>write it a buy.</v>

47
00:02:57.321 --> 00:03:02.321
<v Speaker 2>Now that means more accessing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>subconscious and the fact that if I</v>

48
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 2>begin writing a poem on that means I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>intrigued in some way by whatever it's</v>

49
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:12.181
<v Speaker 2>about and that if I'm not trying to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>something new and pushing that envelope</v>

50
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 2>in the poem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't expect my reader to be</v>

51
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 2>particularly excited about it either.</v>
