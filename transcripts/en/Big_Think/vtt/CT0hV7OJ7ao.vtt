1
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.840
<v Speaker 1>Right now we would like to invite our</v>
<v Speaker 1>guest Avanto professor John seely Brown,</v>

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.010
<v Speaker 1>who was conferred and honorary doctor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>information systems degree in</v>

3
00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:13.070
<v Speaker 1>recognition of his outstanding record as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scientist,</v>

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.730
<v Speaker 1>scholar and innovator on the stage to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say a few words,</v>

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Professor Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

6
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.733
<v Speaker 2>Good afternoon.</v>

7
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 2>Soon as you've already seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can learn a tremendous amount,</v>

8
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.900
<v Speaker 2>but the ability to improvise is a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>good skill.</v>

9
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 2>If you want to be a dean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve</v>

10
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.040
<v Speaker 2>felt for you up here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a brief conversation with Steve</v>

11
00:00:55.531 --> 00:01:00.531
<v Speaker 2>coming over and you heard this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these magnificent things that I</v>

12
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 2>supposedly have done a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this wonderful award for it,</v>

13
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
<v Speaker 2>but he was surprised when I kind of came</v>
<v Speaker 2>up in a conversation.</v>

14
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 2>I cow did such a hardcore geek as I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>turning into such a softy into such a</v>

15
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 2>person that believes in the power of</v>
<v Speaker 2>social science.</v>

16
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve,</v>

17
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually quite simple.</v>

18
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 2>You didn't talk about my first job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My first job that happened to have been</v>

19
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 2>the youngest licensed bookie in New York</v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

20
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 2>I got that job 18 years old because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a geek.</v>

21
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 2>I could compute all kinds of amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>things in my head with blinding speed,</v>

22
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 2>but within the first day of my job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I discovered being able to be able to</v>

23
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 2>compute amazingly complex things in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>

24
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.290
<v Speaker 2>didn't really matter what really</v>
<v Speaker 2>mattered was being able to read the</v>

25
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:06.270
<v Speaker 2>people approaching me to make book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you could read them,</v>

26
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.870
<v Speaker 2>you suddenly realize which ones are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to teach you in which ones</v>

27
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:10.704
<v Speaker 2>weren't.</v>

28
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 2>And was kind of the first moment that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>began to realize that maybe it was more</v>

29
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 2>important to read context that just be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to compute the content.</v>

30
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where I kind of Steve started</v>

31
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:25.740
<v Speaker 2>down this path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not why I'm here today.</v>

32
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 2>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live in,</v>

33
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 2>in some ways a terrifying world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also an exciting world.</v>

34
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.610
<v Speaker 2>We've already heard left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

35
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 2>and sideways the amazing kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>disruptions that are happening.</v>

36
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.640
<v Speaker 2>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we here in this room have the unusual</v>

37
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 2>property that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are creating the tools that lead to</v>

38
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 2>radical disruption around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But simultaneously,</v>

39
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 2>we're creating the tools that let us to</v>
<v Speaker 2>build new ways to learn new ways to</v>

40
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new ways to innovate,</v>

41
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 2>new ways to create meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in some sense we're causing the</v>

42
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 2>disruptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're also creating the tools in</v>

43
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:14.521
<v Speaker 2>which to reinvent the industrial world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the corporate world,</v>

44
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 2>the learning world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world of actually making meaning</v>

45
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right and sideways.</v>

46
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 2>So of his call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This the big shift.</v>

47
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 2>We call it the big shift because perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first time in the history of</v>

48
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 2>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're moving from a world you might call</v>

49
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:35.371
<v Speaker 2>an s curve world where you have a moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>of radical punctuation with 50,</v>

50
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 2>60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 years or more or less stability in</v>

51
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 2>terms of the infrastructures that</v>
<v Speaker 2>defining how we work,</v>

52
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 2>learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interact,</v>

53
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:43.990
<v Speaker 2>socialize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc. Etc.</v>

54
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Speaker 2>That has bEen a history of the last 300</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

55
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:49.210
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't bore you with taking you through</v>

56
00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 2>300 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we now live and what we all in this</v>

57
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:57.841
<v Speaker 2>room would call the exponential world</v>
<v Speaker 2>where basically we no longer have these</v>

58
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 2>long periods of stability with which to</v>
<v Speaker 2>reinvent how we work,</v>

59
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.280
<v Speaker 2>how we learn and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we're entering as a world in which</v>

60
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:13.591
<v Speaker 2>in fact we can't even tell our students</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they should know five years from</v>

61
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:19.081
<v Speaker 2>now because in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're moving into a world in which the</v>

62
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:24.091
<v Speaker 2>average half life of a skill is moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>from about 30 years to about five years.</v>

63
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.520
<v Speaker 2>That means that we're going to have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do most of our learning after we leave</v>

64
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 2>here today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to have to do most of</v>

65
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 2>our learning in the workplace itself in</v>
<v Speaker 2>one form or another.</v>

66
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those of us that design corporate</v>

67
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 2>architectures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>institutional architectures,</v>

68
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 2>have to step back and realize that for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last hundred years,</v>

69
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 2>the west became powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The east became powerful because we</v>

70
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:57.991
<v Speaker 2>could actually build institutions that</v>
<v Speaker 2>understood how to leverage scalable</v>

71
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 2>efficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We knew how to scale things,</v>

72
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 2>but to make things scalable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to become predictable.</v>

73
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.600
<v Speaker 2>Predictability was the coin of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>realm,</v>

74
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 2>and virtually every single corporate</v>
<v Speaker 2>strategy I've ever looked at found new</v>

75
00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:18.910
<v Speaker 2>ways to leverage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you wish,</v>

76
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 2>scalable efficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the dirty secret.</v>

77
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.550
<v Speaker 2>Those very things that made her so</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful for the last 50 or 60 years</v>

78
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.670
<v Speaker 2>are the very things that stand in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>way now</v>

79
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.280
<v Speaker 2>because they no longer work because we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have predictability.</v>

80
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 2>We can't predict customer needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't preDict what object to build in</v>

81
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 2>massive quantities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>store up in warehouses and distributed</v>

82
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:50.710
<v Speaker 2>through superior transportation</v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructures and so on and so forth.</v>

83
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.170
<v Speaker 2>So some of us have been looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue of how do we actually move from</v>

84
00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.200
<v Speaker 2>basically an underlying strategic basis</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all our institutions of scalable</v>

85
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 2>efficiency to the notion of scalable</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning.</v>

86
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 2>How do we actually think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>reinventing corporations,</v>

87
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 2>public institutions and so on and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>forth,</v>

88
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 2>whose job it is to make sure that those</v>
<v Speaker 2>of us that work in those institutions</v>

89
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 2>learn faster than almost anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

90
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 2>why kids today go to google?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eat by the way,</v>

91
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 2>is not because of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe it or not,</v>

92
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 2>it's because at google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the bay area where I come from,</v>

93
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.600
<v Speaker 2>you will learn faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>

94
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.660
<v Speaker 2>you learn newer technologies there in</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually any other place in the country</v>

95
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.980
<v Speaker 2>and probably the world.</v>

96
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.260
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a very Interesting book out</v>

97
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.800
<v Speaker 2>called the race against the machine</v>
<v Speaker 2>written by two economists from mit that</v>

98
00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:02.261
<v Speaker 2>are trying to explain why in fact maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be so few jobs are</v>

99
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:05.290
<v Speaker 2>fewer jobs in the new normal protocol</v>
<v Speaker 2>call,</v>

100
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.350
<v Speaker 2>so to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

101
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because basically most of our jobs as</v>

102
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:15.371
<v Speaker 2>they claim can now be done by machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that probably is somewhat true,</v>

103
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.810
<v Speaker 2>but some of us are reframing the race</v>
<v Speaker 2>against the machine to be the race with</v>

104
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.210
<v Speaker 2>the machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we actually think about how do we</v>

105
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:36.761
<v Speaker 2>in the machine work together better than</v>
<v Speaker 2>either one by ourselves,</v>

106
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 2>by themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact,</v>

107
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:43.820
<v Speaker 2>that causes us to radically we frame</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we think about in terms of</v>

108
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.850
<v Speaker 2>augmented intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>augmented capabilities to innovate and</v>

109
00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:51.620
<v Speaker 2>so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

110
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 2>if you play chess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may be surprised to know that of</v>

111
00:07:57.141 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few years ago,</v>

112
00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:03.461
<v Speaker 2>ibm built this mega machine that</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually ended up building beating the</v>

113
00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:08.561
<v Speaker 2>world champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's what you might not know.</v>

114
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.940
<v Speaker 2>You take the world's best chess players.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take the world's best mega machines,</v>

115
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:22.290
<v Speaker 2>and guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>both can be easily beat by a moderately</v>

116
00:08:24.191 --> 00:08:29.191
<v Speaker 2>good chest team playing with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>moderately good machine.</v>

117
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Well these kids have figured out is how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use the machine to augment what they</v>

118
00:08:36.311 --> 00:08:39.430
<v Speaker 2>do so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pair of those things working</v>

119
00:08:39.431 --> 00:08:44.431
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man in machine now beats the hell out of</v>

120
00:08:44.561 --> 00:08:49.561
<v Speaker 2>the world's best chess machine and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world's best chess players.</v>

121
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 2>So I want to suggest that we go forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to be very creative in how we</v>

122
00:08:56.371 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 2>think better about augmenting human</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and how we can work more</v>

123
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 2>effectively with machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I want to suggest equally</v>

124
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:09.510
<v Speaker 2>challenging because some of you here are</v>
<v Speaker 2>also going to be architecting</v>

125
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 2>organizations of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We ought to be thinking about how do we</v>

126
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:19.190
<v Speaker 2>reinvent institutional architectures to</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually lead to scalable learning in</v>

127
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:26.931
<v Speaker 2>the workplace and in our governments and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is a new type of design</v>

128
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:32.901
<v Speaker 2>challenge and we add to that what we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>now capable of doing with cloud</v>

129
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:38.190
<v Speaker 2>computing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now how we can actually rethink</v>

130
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.280
<v Speaker 2>learning on demand as well so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime we get stuck we can pull</v>

131
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:49.581
<v Speaker 2>information tours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that pulling content that's not</v>

132
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:51.450
<v Speaker 2>pulling context.</v>

133
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.180
<v Speaker 2>That's not pointing dispositions and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

134
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.930
<v Speaker 2>so we gotta kind of be careful to keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>in mind the difference between</v>

135
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:01.950
<v Speaker 2>character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between dispositions and the</v>

136
00:10:01.951 --> 00:10:06.570
<v Speaker 2>difference between knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fond of using the term,</v>

137
00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 2>the entrepreneurial learner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because I'm concerned about how to</v>

138
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:14.160
<v Speaker 2>train entrepreneurs per se,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm very interested in the</v>

139
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:19.140
<v Speaker 2>disposition that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every moment of the day I personally</v>

140
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.560
<v Speaker 2>have a chance to learn something new and</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can actually do something,</v>

141
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:30.050
<v Speaker 2>put yourself out in the edge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often get stuck and then what you do.</v>

142
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.890
<v Speaker 2>You pull information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're moving from an education based on</v>

143
00:10:34.891 --> 00:10:39.891
<v Speaker 2>push to learning on demand pull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now I pull the information into a</v>

144
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:43.530
<v Speaker 2>context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a situation that's personally</v>

145
00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:47.610
<v Speaker 2>meaningful to me because it stuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to go to use that information</v>

146
00:10:47.611 --> 00:10:51.990
<v Speaker 2>as fast as can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a to see if I can get myself unstuck.</v>

147
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.500
<v Speaker 2>So that's how suddenly all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning becomes so real and I can make</v>

148
00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 2>it so personal that whatever you do this</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

149
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.830
<v Speaker 2>you basically never forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I do want to suggest that a couple of</v>

150
00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:09.660
<v Speaker 2>things we should be thinking about as we</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave today.</v>

151
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I think one is to make sure we ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get stuck in ruts.</v>

152
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:22.610
<v Speaker 2>My single biggest advice to most</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporate ceos is what are you doing to</v>

153
00:11:23.461 --> 00:11:28.461
<v Speaker 2>make sure you aren't stuck in a rut?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if this game is changing every five</v>

154
00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:30.960
<v Speaker 2>years as opposed to every 35 or 40</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

155
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.650
<v Speaker 2>that means the things that made us</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful yesterday,</v>

156
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.650
<v Speaker 2>maybe exactly the things that blind us</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

157
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.490
<v Speaker 2>So how do we keep from being stuck in</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruts?</v>

158
00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to suggest the second thing as</v>
<v Speaker 2>we move in increasingly from thinking</v>

159
00:11:46.141 --> 00:11:51.141
<v Speaker 2>about machines is we can take apart like</v>
<v Speaker 2>clocks to we now living in a world where</v>

160
00:11:52.531 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 2>everything is interconnected.</v>

161
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.490
<v Speaker 2>The smallest moves can now propagate</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world.</v>

162
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we may have to shift from thinking about</v>

163
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:05.761
<v Speaker 2>machines and mechanisms to thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about biology as a fundamental metaphor.</v>

164
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:11.560
<v Speaker 2>How do we think about emerging systems?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we begin to understand sometimes</v>

165
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.070
<v Speaker 2>certain moves seem so positive on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>surface,</v>

166
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.310
<v Speaker 2>but ended up having all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>secondary consequences,</v>

167
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.580
<v Speaker 2>which is always a way that many complex</v>
<v Speaker 2>ecological systems actually work,</v>

168
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 2>so I think we're actually going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving if you wish,</v>

169
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.800
<v Speaker 2>as coral poppers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>head on the world of clocks,</v>

170
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:36.720
<v Speaker 2>mechanical systems that can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>deconstructed and tinkered with here,</v>

171
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.500
<v Speaker 2>buy gear to a world of clouds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as a pun,</v>

172
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.710
<v Speaker 2>not as cloud computing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they could talk forever about cloud</v>

173
00:12:44.711 --> 00:12:46.810
<v Speaker 2>computing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as clowns,</v>

174
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:49.890
<v Speaker 2>as these things in the sky that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>emergent,</v>

175
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.180
<v Speaker 2>how do we start designing emerging</v>
<v Speaker 2>systems because clouds are complex</v>

176
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:57.510
<v Speaker 2>adaptive systems and as soon as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>touch it,</v>

177
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.840
<v Speaker 2>something changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the challenges we face</v>

178
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.800
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck and helping us all figure out</v>

179
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.080
<v Speaker 2>how to live in the new world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

180
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.260
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>
