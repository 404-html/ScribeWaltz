00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I would define compassion in a nutshell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a natural sense of concern that</v>

2
00:00:11.291 --> 00:00:16.291
<v Speaker 1>arises in us in the face of someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a need or someone who's in pain and</v>

3
00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:21.361
<v Speaker 1>accompanied by a kind of a wishing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the relief or end of that situation</v>

4
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.640
<v Speaker 1>and wanted to do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's compassionate.</v>

5
00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:29.641
<v Speaker 1>It's not just an emotional reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is also a more motivational kind</v>

6
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:34.000
<v Speaker 1>of element which makes us want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about the situation.</v>

7
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.550
<v Speaker 1>One of the interesting thing about our</v>
<v Speaker 1>contemporary modern society is that I'm</v>

8
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>given the highly competitive nature of</v>
<v Speaker 1>society and also the way in which we're</v>

9
00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:48.430
<v Speaker 1>bringing up our children and the way in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we ourselves grew up,</v>

10
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>which involved huge amount of evaluation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and judgment and comparison across with</v>

11
00:00:53.951 --> 00:00:56.920
<v Speaker 1>others from a very early age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>we have kind of internalized a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of way of being in the world and</v>

13
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.320
<v Speaker 1>perceiving our relationship with others.</v>

14
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.390
<v Speaker 1>And that dynamic has created a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

15
00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:13.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhibitions against our natural</v>

16
00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:15.700
<v Speaker 1>compassionate instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

17
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:19.420
<v Speaker 1>and these inhibitions really take</v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily in the form of fear.</v>

18
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.130
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people worry and I'm afraid that if</v>

19
00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:28.810
<v Speaker 1>they are too kind and compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that other people will take advantage of</v>

20
00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:31.970
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will see them as pushover or weak</v>

21
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.160
<v Speaker 1>or losers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one type of fear that we</v>

22
00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:39.130
<v Speaker 1>bring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the type of fear that we bring</v>

23
00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in popular understanding of</v>

25
00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:46.780
<v Speaker 1>compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so dominated by compassion as an</v>

26
00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a soft heart and tender heart</v>

27
00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:53.470
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people worry that if they allow their</v>

28
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Speaker 1>compassionate and kinder instinct to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become more dominant in their way of</v>

29
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.030
<v Speaker 1>interacting with the world and others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.540
<v Speaker 1>somehow it might undermine their more</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational,</v>

31
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 1>tougher aside so that they may not be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to succeed in the life and compete.</v>

32
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 1>That's another type of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then sometimes,</v>

33
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in intimate relations that particularly</v>

34
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.220
<v Speaker 1>between parents and children on the part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the parents,</v>

35
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.570
<v Speaker 1>sometimes we also worry that if we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind to our children,</v>

36
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might be spoiling them,</v>

37
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

38
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.160
<v Speaker 1>they might become overdependent up on us</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then somehow we will end up having</v>

39
00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:34.900
<v Speaker 1>to do everything for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are various types of fear that</v>

40
00:02:34.901 --> 00:02:39.070
<v Speaker 1>we bring into our expression of natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate instinct.</v>

41
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.120
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of these are subconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>biases that we bring.</v>

42
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:45.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people may not necessarily sit down and</v>

43
00:02:45.491 --> 00:02:49.180
<v Speaker 1>think that's what I'm going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these are culturally acquired</v>

44
00:02:49.181 --> 00:02:54.181
<v Speaker 1>sensibilities and biases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also makes us suspicious when</v>

45
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:57.010
<v Speaker 1>someone has been kind to us</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate towards us,</v>

46
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>we start one wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there must be hidden agenda,</v>

47
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that person must want something</v>

48
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:03.800
<v Speaker 1>from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

49
00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm very unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are various forms of culturally</v>

50
00:03:07.891 --> 00:03:12.891
<v Speaker 1>acquired fear that really undermines the</v>
<v Speaker 1>expression of what is really natural to</v>

51
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>our human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the ability to connect with</v>

52
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>someone and the ability to relate to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person at a deeper level and have a</v>

53
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>much more open heart hearted kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>
