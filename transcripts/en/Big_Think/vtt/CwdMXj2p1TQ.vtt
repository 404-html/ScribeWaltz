1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Rita dove</v>
<v Speaker 2>title,</v>

3
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 2>professor of English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess</v>

4
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I read</v>

5
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.490
<v Speaker 2>this sounds really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I was about 10 or 11,</v>

6
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.330
<v Speaker 2>I stumbled across the Elliot at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My father had bought the great books of</v>

7
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:35.120
<v Speaker 2>the Western world and one of the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>books there was the elliot.</v>

8
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a very long thing and I</v>

9
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.870
<v Speaker 2>thought this is the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 2>literature,</v>

10
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:46.871
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to read this and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>understood probably about half of it,</v>

11
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.040
<v Speaker 2>but it was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an incredibly tense and</v>

12
00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:54.830
<v Speaker 2>interesting story and once I got into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole</v>

13
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 2>way that the poems worked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it were like a,</v>

14
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.450
<v Speaker 2>like a swash buckling mystery in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that made me feel like,</v>

15
00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:06.680
<v Speaker 2>gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is exciting.</v>

16
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:07.670
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to do that too.</v>

17
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.240
<v Speaker 2>The one that I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote posts before this,</v>

18
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:17.900
<v Speaker 2>but the one that I consider first real</v>
<v Speaker 2>poem was about that time too,</v>

19
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 2>but it was an easter poem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

20
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.520
<v Speaker 2>in school we were supposed to write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write,</v>

21
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.030
<v Speaker 2>or paint or do something artistic for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Easter.</v>

22
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.570
<v Speaker 2>So I wrote this poem called the rabbit</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the droopy ear and I remember it</v>

23
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.920
<v Speaker 2>because when I began writing the poem I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had no idea how it was going to end.</v>

24
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:41.390
<v Speaker 2>I just had this idea of a rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Easter bunny who had one ear that</v>

25
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>droop down and he was distressed.</v>

26
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 2>So I kept writing and it rhymed and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

27
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 2>and it was actually the rhyme itself</v>
<v Speaker 2>that helped me solve the problem of a</v>

28
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:55.220
<v Speaker 2>rabbit with the droopy year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the end of the poem that goes hip,</v>

29
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:55.851
<v Speaker 2>hip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hooray,</v>

30
00:01:55.851 --> 00:01:59.420
<v Speaker 2>let's toast the cup for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both ears were hanging up,</v>

31
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.350
<v Speaker 2>he hanged himself from a tree and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>ears hang straight and everybody's</v>

32
00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 2>cheering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just,</v>

33
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very exciting to find that.</v>

34
00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:10.880
<v Speaker 2>Indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually had to read it aloud in</v>

35
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

36
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.050
<v Speaker 2>that was another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were the days when you did these</v>

37
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:18.140
<v Speaker 2>things in class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now people showed their paintings if</v>

38
00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:21.670
<v Speaker 2>they had something from eastern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to read my poem aloud and,</v>

39
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.890
<v Speaker 2>and people liked it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids liked it,</v>

40
00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:26.780
<v Speaker 2>my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was an instant success story.</v>

41
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.500
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't totally changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

42
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.640
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's changed in the sense that,</v>

43
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.950
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

44
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.090
<v Speaker 2>to some extent I know let's say that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>goal is not to come to some kind of neat</v>

45
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:47.310
<v Speaker 2>solution as that did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

46
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it hasn't changed in the sense that</v>

47
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.330
<v Speaker 2>at some level I'm never quite sure how</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poem is going to resolve itself and</v>

48
00:02:58.381 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 2>that I'm always in some way surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make a discovery in a poem once I</v>

49
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:07.981
<v Speaker 2>write it a buy now that means more</v>
<v Speaker 2>accessing the subconscious and the fact</v>

50
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 2>that if I begin writing a poem on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>means I'm intrigued in some way by</v>

51
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:20.131
<v Speaker 2>whatever it's about and that if I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to find something new and pushing</v>

52
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 2>that envelope in the poem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't expect my reader to be</v>

53
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 2>particularly excited about it either.</v>

54
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different every time.</v>

55
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago there was an,</v>

56
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 2>I did do something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

57
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.540
<v Speaker 2>for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a magazine.</v>

58
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're a,</v>

59
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 2>we're a journalist actually followed me</v>
<v Speaker 2>around and we tried to.</v>

60
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm frightened different every time.</v>

61
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.050
<v Speaker 2>My inspiration comes from everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

62
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 2>just walking down the street just and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>never know where it's going to come</v>

63
00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:57.850
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I keep a notebook with me at all</v>

64
00:03:57.851 --> 00:03:58.710
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

65
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 2>and the only criteria for anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>making it into that notebook is if it</v>

66
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 2>stops me in my tracks for even an</v>
<v Speaker 2>instant,</v>

67
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.490
<v Speaker 2>if it catches my eye or my ear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

68
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just write it down.</v>

69
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 2>That means that there are recipes in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

70
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are words and sometimes there's a</v>

71
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 2>character description or sometimes it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>aligned.</v>

72
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.630
<v Speaker 2>And after that point though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is kind of odd.</v>

73
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend to,</v>

74
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 2>I work in fragments in the sense that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to sit down and say,</v>

75
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 2>first line is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now I'm going to just write my way</v>

76
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:40.420
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I let the poem,</v>

77
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 2>it's like piecing it together like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pot.</v>

78
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 2>So I might have a line that I might</v>
<v Speaker 2>write down on the middle of a page and I</v>

79
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 2>still write things down with a pen on</v>
<v Speaker 2>paper.</v>

80
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.820
<v Speaker 2>I go to the computer when it gets too</v>
<v Speaker 2>messy and use it like an elaborate</v>

81
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.430
<v Speaker 2>typewriter because I've printed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I mess it up again,</v>

82
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.020
<v Speaker 2>but when I do get down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit down to write in my room with my</v>

83
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 2>study and I try to write it a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>time every night.</v>

84
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm a night person at best times or</v>
<v Speaker 2>midnight to six,</v>

85
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:14.701
<v Speaker 2>actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll leave you my notebooks and if</v>

86
00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:19.380
<v Speaker 2>something catches my eye and I feel like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to transfer it from the notebook</v>

87
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.260
<v Speaker 2>to the page I do.</v>

88
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 2>And then comes this very strange</v>
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>

89
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:28.280
<v Speaker 2>which is difficult to describe and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

90
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 2>right until I get stuck or I can't go</v>
<v Speaker 2>any further,</v>

91
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm boring myself or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I might go to another poem.</v>

92
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might go to another folder where there</v>

93
00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 2>are other drafts of poems and various</v>
<v Speaker 2>stages of completion.</v>

94
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.360
<v Speaker 2>And the only way I have for keeping</v>
<v Speaker 2>track of all this fragment tarry stuff</v>

95
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.410
<v Speaker 2>is by color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have different colored folders,</v>

96
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 2>red folders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue,</v>

97
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 2>yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I might go into my study,</v>

98
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 2>let's say one evening and say I feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the blue folder today</v>

99
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 2>and I'll pick up the blue folder and see</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's in there.</v>

100
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 2>So it's something that I've kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked out over the years,</v>

101
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:14.440
<v Speaker 2>but the colors are only because I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to put anything.</v>

102
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to file anything in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a straight.</v>

103
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you put something in a file</v>

104
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:26.291
<v Speaker 2>that says war poems or love pumps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you already restrict the way in</v>

105
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 2>which the pole might move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I put it in blue,</v>

106
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.220
<v Speaker 2>it could be sad blue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be happy blue,</v>

107
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:39.221
<v Speaker 2>it can be peaceful blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my mood at the moment when I'm about</v>

108
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:42.690
<v Speaker 2>to work on that poem wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

109
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 2>will tell me where I want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's an odd process,</v>

110
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.880
<v Speaker 2>but I do do lots of revisions and I love</v>
<v Speaker 2>to revise.</v>

111
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.820
<v Speaker 2>So 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 revisions is not unusual at this</v>

112
00:06:55.821 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do most of my revisions by myself</v>

113
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:05.081
<v Speaker 2>until I reach a point where I either</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to give it lots of time because</v>

114
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 2>time is a great reviser to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

115
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.120
<v Speaker 2>just months of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>

116
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.000
<v Speaker 2>putting it aside or I will show it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times I'll show it to my</v>

117
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 2>husband who is a novelist and as a prose</v>
<v Speaker 2>writer,</v>

118
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.290
<v Speaker 2>he has a totally different take on</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

119
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.290
<v Speaker 2>So he comes at it a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

120
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I yearned for those old days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

121
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.410
<v Speaker 2>from graduate school and you go into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>workshop and people would give you all</v>

122
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.920
<v Speaker 2>these ideas and you take it away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

123
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.070
<v Speaker 2>But at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

124
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 2>that just doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not in the current.</v>

125
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:43.361
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's both.</v>

126
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.410
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you certainly don't have to be aged</v>

127
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:50.530
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

128
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.710
<v Speaker 2>and travel the world to write a poem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact sometimes traveling the world</v>

129
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:55.310
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

130
00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:00.310
<v Speaker 2>is a way of not writing a poem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the quality of experiences</v>

131
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.300
<v Speaker 2>being able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to experience something.</v>

132
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 2>And</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you begin to write about it,</v>

133
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.950
<v Speaker 2>be able to apply the tools that you need</v>
<v Speaker 2>for writing,</v>

134
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mastery of the language in a way of,</v>

135
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:17.131
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

136
00:08:17.131 --> 00:08:19.700
<v Speaker 2>of piecing together the language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess</v>

137
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 2>that those two factors have to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

138
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:29.290
<v Speaker 2>So you do need to be to work at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also have to be able to know</v>

139
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:33.860
<v Speaker 2>when to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when to take the experience as it</v>

140
00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when to tweak it a little bit,</v>

141
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.190
<v Speaker 2>what part of the experience is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>move somebody else or what part is</v>

142
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:45.460
<v Speaker 2>really your own private moment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've,</v>

143
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:51.380
<v Speaker 2>I've seen poems written by very young</v>
<v Speaker 2>people which are absolutely stunning and</v>

144
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:55.010
<v Speaker 2>of course we have examples of bod layer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wrote.</v>

145
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.540
<v Speaker 2>He was in his teens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These were amazing poem.</v>

146
00:08:57.541 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 2>So he obviously didn't have a wealth of</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience or age or anything like that.</v>

147
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen pumps which of course</v>
<v Speaker 2>could only have been written by someone</v>

148
00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:10.371
<v Speaker 2>who was older and had lived a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>stages of life,</v>

149
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 2>have gone through certain stages of</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

150
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.220
<v Speaker 2>But it's a combination of the two really</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

151
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

152
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.890
<v Speaker 2>I've always felt that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poems I've written,</v>

153
00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:30.891
<v Speaker 2>which have historical contexts</v>
<v Speaker 2>are hopefully not just simply plucking</v>

154
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:35.910
<v Speaker 2>something out of history and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh great,</v>

155
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:36.840
<v Speaker 2>let's write about that.</v>

156
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:41.160
<v Speaker 2>In every case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what has happened is that I've become</v>

157
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:46.490
<v Speaker 2>fascinated or haunted by something and</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't shake it as an African</v>

158
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:48.090
<v Speaker 2>American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a woman,</v>

159
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I think that I've been sensitized to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way of which history of privileges of</v>

160
00:09:56.401 --> 00:10:01.200
<v Speaker 2>white male and the way in which certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects of history,</v>

161
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.400
<v Speaker 2>the things that we are taught in school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that are handed down,</v>

162
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.340
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never entered the picture,</v>

163
00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.940
<v Speaker 2>but they might've been very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone can tell you that,</v>

164
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the risk of over simplification,</v>

165
00:10:15.121 --> 00:10:16.860
<v Speaker 2>let me say that anyone can tell you</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

166
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.023
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

167
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.180
<v Speaker 2>how you're raised as a child has a great</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal to do with how you behave as an</v>

168
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:25.050
<v Speaker 2>adult and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

169
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.910
<v Speaker 2>whether you have complexes or whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to prove yourself or all that</v>

170
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:29.880
<v Speaker 2>kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet</v>

171
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.800
<v Speaker 2>the mother in a traditional family who</v>
<v Speaker 2>has raised chuck never makes it in the</v>

172
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:38.070
<v Speaker 2>history books.</v>

173
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

174
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.590
<v Speaker 2>so those kinds of things have always</v>
<v Speaker 2>irritated me.</v>

175
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>

176
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.440
<v Speaker 2>and I'm always reminded when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I see someone,</v>

177
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.370
<v Speaker 2>Napoleon's stocks through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>battlefields.</v>

178
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.570
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

179
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.000
<v Speaker 2>but how do you get that way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How this guy become who he was.</v>

180
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.480
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the predisposition I have.</v>

181
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.600
<v Speaker 2>I think us as a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a person</v>

182
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.240
<v Speaker 2>who wanted to create poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that has always</v>

183
00:11:09.241 --> 00:11:13.830
<v Speaker 2>been one of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>things I carry along with me</v>

184
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.890
<v Speaker 2>each time is different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

185
00:11:16.891 --> 00:11:21.070
<v Speaker 2>in this new book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a tells the story of a,</v>

186
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.480
<v Speaker 2>of a black mixed race violin is George</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bridgetown who grew up in 18th and 19th</v>

187
00:11:29.071 --> 00:11:33.780
<v Speaker 2>century Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came upon him because I was watching a</v>

188
00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:37.500
<v Speaker 2>movie immortal beloved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was a scene in which Beethoven</v>

189
00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:42.120
<v Speaker 2>walks by a group of musicians and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this black violence on my,</v>

190
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:47.310
<v Speaker 2>what I've heard of color of my casting</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a bit strange.</v>

191
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:52.700
<v Speaker 2>And so I looked him up and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't intend to write poems.</v>

192
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:55.280
<v Speaker 2>I above it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

193
00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:00.130
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to know more about it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept reading and the more I read,</v>

194
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:05.700
<v Speaker 2>the more I realized the only way I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get him out of my head was to</v>

195
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.700
<v Speaker 2>get into his start writing down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in each case it's,</v>

196
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.160
<v Speaker 2>it's been something like that.</v>

197
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.770
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to be a mix of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

198
00:12:19.771 --> 00:12:21.720
<v Speaker 2>What I find very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well first of all,</v>

199
00:12:21.721 --> 00:12:26.721
<v Speaker 2>poetry of all the forms of literature I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think is the most suited for the digital</v>

200
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.220
<v Speaker 2>age and for the shorter attention spans</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of that.</v>

201
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.391
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

202
00:12:33.391 --> 00:12:37.550
<v Speaker 2>twitter's very easily some lyric pumps</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

203
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.730
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to zip up home to</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>

204
00:12:41.731 --> 00:12:44.960
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things I think</v>

205
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:50.040
<v Speaker 2>wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 2>about poetry in the digital age.</v>

206
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:55.520
<v Speaker 2>I think that is going to be a mix</v>
<v Speaker 2>between people who will really only need</v>

207
00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:00.880
<v Speaker 2>to see a book on a page and those who</v>
<v Speaker 2>will only want to hear on the stage.</v>

208
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.900
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear the hear the oral word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting about the digital age</v>

209
00:13:07.711 --> 00:13:12.711
<v Speaker 2>is because of all of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways in which we have of transporting</v>

210
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.240
<v Speaker 2>moving images now and making it very</v>
<v Speaker 2>portable.</v>

211
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.700
<v Speaker 2>The oral aspect of portraits coming back</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the portrait began as an oral</v>

212
00:13:23.701 --> 00:13:28.350
<v Speaker 2>discipline and we had the printing press</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it became gradually something</v>

213
00:13:28.351 --> 00:13:29.370
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

214
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.360
<v Speaker 2>began to lose a little bit of its</v>
<v Speaker 2>musicality because now we could read it.</v>

215
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.910
<v Speaker 2>So all of the rhymed pumps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

216
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the formal homes,</v>

217
00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:41.580
<v Speaker 2>which certainly began as a way of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

218
00:13:41.581 --> 00:13:45.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>helping us remember a poem as an aid to</v>

219
00:13:45.841 --> 00:13:48.590
<v Speaker 2>memory it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't necessary anymore.</v>

220
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.240
<v Speaker 2>We moved away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we have spoken word,</v>

221
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.770
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's coming back in.</v>

222
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.320
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely fascinating to me.</v>

223
00:13:55.321 --> 00:13:59.190
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to change a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit more,</v>

224
00:13:59.191 --> 00:14:04.170
<v Speaker 2>become a little bit more musical and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll have a whole range of things.</v>

225
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:09.230
<v Speaker 2>But it's an exciting time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My first advice would be to read,</v>

226
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:12.711
<v Speaker 2>read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read it,</v>

227
00:14:12.711 --> 00:14:14.770
<v Speaker 2>which sounds interesting coming in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>digital age,</v>

228
00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:19.771
<v Speaker 2>but it's so much easier to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 2>upon it is to sit down and actually read</v>

229
00:14:22.271 --> 00:14:25.120
<v Speaker 2>it and to hear it in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that,</v>

230
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:30.630
<v Speaker 2>that every poet or aspiring poet needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to do anything to hear it in</v>

231
00:14:30.641 --> 00:14:33.910
<v Speaker 2>their head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I wish someone had told me,</v>

232
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:35.460
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>

233
00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:42.340
<v Speaker 2>I wish someone had told me that</v>

234
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:50.150
<v Speaker 2>my stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>are really mine to tell another with</v>

235
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:55.250
<v Speaker 2>anything that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is important or that that has</v>

236
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 2>moved me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has the ability to move somebody else.</v>

237
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:05.120
<v Speaker 2>It was a long process too for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think for many young poets to be</v>

238
00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:12.860
<v Speaker 2>able to realize that even the smallest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most domestic,</v>

239
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience can move someone else.</v>

240
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:20.710
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

241
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.720
<v Speaker 2>the Trojan war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

242
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.730
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have to be the Elliot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

243
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to be something that,</v>

244
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:29.541
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

245
00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:32.510
<v Speaker 2>we'll get to history that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes it to the front page of the</v>

246
00:15:32.511 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 2>news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we live our lives in detail.</v>

247
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.540
<v Speaker 2>All of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we walked down the street,</v>

248
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.720
<v Speaker 2>we breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we hear things,</v>

249
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:45.970
<v Speaker 2>we try to transcribe it in generalities</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the details are what make us come</v>

250
00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:50.870
<v Speaker 2>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wish someone had said that just at</v>

251
00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:53.030
<v Speaker 2>the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wouldn't have felt so discouraged</v>

252
00:15:53.031 --> 00:15:57.200
<v Speaker 2>when I began writing and thinking who</v>
<v Speaker 2>would want to hear the stories of a</v>

253
00:15:57.201 --> 00:15:59.250
<v Speaker 2>young black girl?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

254
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.170
<v Speaker 2>growing up in the Midwest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

255
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.230
<v Speaker 2>that's not interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to live in Paris.</v>

256
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:04.363
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

257
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm not thinking of my audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which does not mean that I'm doing it</v>

258
00:16:11.511 --> 00:16:13.320
<v Speaker 2>for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

259
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:17.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking at the very beginning when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I begin writing a poem,</v>

260
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:22.570
<v Speaker 2>I try not to think of the audience or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone at all except for trying to get</v>

261
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:30.850
<v Speaker 2>at the very center of what's driving</v>
<v Speaker 2>that poem.</v>

262
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:31.850
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

263
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:37.600
<v Speaker 2>In a way it's like analyzing myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did I even sit down to write this?</v>

264
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Why is it even interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it that drives this thing that</v>

265
00:16:42.261 --> 00:16:47.261
<v Speaker 2>means excess assets in the that means</v>
<v Speaker 2>going down into the very deepest</v>

266
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:52.730
<v Speaker 2>psychological moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things that can frightened and scare you</v>

267
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:57.750
<v Speaker 2>and I think that to think of an audience</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that point would actually drive those</v>

268
00:16:58.491 --> 00:17:03.460
<v Speaker 2>thoughts away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But during the process of revision and</v>

269
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.500
<v Speaker 2>what happens is that I'm thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the language and how I can use the</v>

270
00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:14.030
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is my tool to convey whatever this</v>

271
00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:19.570
<v Speaker 2>experience slash emotion is so that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone else sits down to read it,</v>

272
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.000
<v Speaker 2>they can also feel it.</v>

273
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:28.300
<v Speaker 2>So it's beyond just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about describing something is</v>

274
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:33.580
<v Speaker 2>also using words would help to shape the</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion so that if it's supposed to be</v>

275
00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:38.240
<v Speaker 2>something very hectic</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a frantic moment,</v>

276
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.410
<v Speaker 2>then the words probably would be shorter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and clipped and</v>

277
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.600
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>During that revision process it becomes</v>

278
00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:50.590
<v Speaker 2>less and less a private matter and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore,</v>

279
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.880
<v Speaker 2>something for an anonymous audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't try to imagine a an audience in</v>

280
00:17:58.681 --> 00:18:02.850
<v Speaker 2>the sense of at that stage I don't try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to imagine the audience in the sense of,</v>

281
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.910
<v Speaker 2>well these are all educated people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

282
00:18:05.911 --> 00:18:10.911
<v Speaker 2>from the ages of 18 to 45.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think of there is someone out</v>

283
00:18:13.351 --> 00:18:17.790
<v Speaker 2>there who might want to read this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they read this little bit.</v>

284
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.410
<v Speaker 2>I want to get them to feel the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that I'm feeling and that's my</v>

285
00:18:22.411 --> 00:18:25.860
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that in the end I'm thinking only of</v>

286
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:27.360
<v Speaker 2>them and I'm not there.</v>

287
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:36.950
<v Speaker 2>It would be wonderful if we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>striving for toward a post racial</v>

288
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:42.000
<v Speaker 2>literature and certainly the election of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama is a big step on the way.</v>

289
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.180
<v Speaker 2>I think that we shouldn't get complacent</v>
<v Speaker 2>and think,</v>

290
00:18:45.181 --> 00:18:46.920
<v Speaker 2>oh gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we're post racial.</v>

291
00:18:46.921 --> 00:18:51.150
<v Speaker 2>We are not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't had the conversations we need</v>

292
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:56.151
<v Speaker 2>to have about race and privilege and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that stuff up.</v>

293
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.240
<v Speaker 2>We're starting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're on our way,</v>

294
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:05.100
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that I've always</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreamed of is to have a post racial</v>

295
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:10.130
<v Speaker 2>literature at you waste so much energy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and good a talent.</v>

296
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:15.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm either trying to insist upon your</v>
<v Speaker 2>presence,</v>

297
00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:20.421
<v Speaker 2>which is certainly what happened in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>black arts movement in the sixties for</v>

298
00:19:22.531 --> 00:19:23.920
<v Speaker 2>instance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

299
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.070
<v Speaker 2>and you also waste a lot of energy then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

300
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:31.570
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost my thought.</v>

301
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wasted a lot of energy insisting</v>

302
00:19:40.511 --> 00:19:42.940
<v Speaker 2>upon your presence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you also can waste a lot of</v>

303
00:19:42.941 --> 00:19:46.990
<v Speaker 2>energy explaining things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining things which are specific to</v>

304
00:19:46.991 --> 00:19:50.680
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a certain racial culture,</v>

305
00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:55.060
<v Speaker 2>which if you think about it in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mainstream,</v>

306
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:59.080
<v Speaker 2>we don't mind looking things up if we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand them,</v>

307
00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:04.530
<v Speaker 2>but we kind of expect to be clued in on</v>
<v Speaker 2>various things that happened in,</v>

308
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:10.210
<v Speaker 2>in the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I've always found</v>

309
00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:17.350
<v Speaker 2>frustrating are the little reference</v>
<v Speaker 2>points that</v>

310
00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.900
<v Speaker 2>I might have to explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a poem that I wouldn't have to explain</v>

311
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.790
<v Speaker 2>if it were in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

312
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.520
<v Speaker 2>if it were a mainstream detail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

313
00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly how a white woman would</v>
<v Speaker 2>do her hair every morning.</v>

314
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.760
<v Speaker 2>I know the washing and the blow drying</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of that kinds of stuff.</v>

315
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.170
<v Speaker 2>But so that if I see that in a poem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it were to occur in a poem,</v>

316
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:47.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I would have problem with it.</v>

317
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:53.010
<v Speaker 2>Whereas for me to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to even to get up and explain getting up</v>

318
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:59.011
<v Speaker 2>and rushing in and how to do my hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would require all sorts of glosses.</v>

319
00:20:59.081 --> 00:20:59.741
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to say,</v>

320
00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:00.251
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

321
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:02.710
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the hair pomade and there's the</v>

322
00:21:02.711 --> 00:21:04.170
<v Speaker 2>visit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

323
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:08.170
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so my hope is that in a,</v>

324
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.690
<v Speaker 2>in a post racial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural,</v>

325
00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:15.040
<v Speaker 2>all these kinds of details,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will just assume that we can figure</v>

326
00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:17.020
<v Speaker 2>them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we will assume that that is</v>

327
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.230
<v Speaker 2>something as we read them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will,</v>

328
00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:22.960
<v Speaker 2>we'll have to look up instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>demanding that our writers,</v>

329
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give us a gloss right in the middle of</v>

330
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:28.060
<v Speaker 2>the palm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're on our way.</v>

331
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:34.870
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was poet laureate,</v>

332
00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.390
<v Speaker 2>when I be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was named poet laureate and went</v>

333
00:21:37.391 --> 00:21:40.660
<v Speaker 2>down to Washington a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>beforehand to meet,</v>

334
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

335
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assistant and meet the Librarian of</v>

336
00:21:44.291 --> 00:21:47.470
<v Speaker 2>Congress and all that into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of acclimate myself.</v>

337
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:52.471
<v Speaker 2>And I did ask what my duties were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only official duties are to a</v>

338
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.980
<v Speaker 2>sponsor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reading series at the library of</v>

339
00:21:56.981 --> 00:22:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Congress twice a month and make sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

340
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.210
<v Speaker 2>So that was fun too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to invite poets from all over</v>

341
00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:09.130
<v Speaker 2>the world actually to come to read and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to read for the archives.</v>

342
00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.640
<v Speaker 2>That was wonderful fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dory.</v>

343
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:15.190
<v Speaker 2>The other duty was to advise the library</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Congress,</v>

344
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.640
<v Speaker 2>the Librarian of Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also,</v>

345
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:24.300
<v Speaker 2>and this was the funny one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to promote poetry in any way that I see</v>

346
00:22:26.051 --> 00:22:27.280
<v Speaker 2>fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

347
00:22:27.281 --> 00:22:29.950
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean to promote poetry?</v>

348
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.230
<v Speaker 2>And</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

349
00:22:32.231 --> 00:22:34.450
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the budget because you're going</v>

350
00:22:34.451 --> 00:22:35.284
<v Speaker 2>to promote you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

351
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.870
<v Speaker 2>and I got to kind of a blank stare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>

352
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.660
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this means that you make it up as you go</v>

353
00:22:40.661 --> 00:22:41.494
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>

354
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.400
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

355
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an artist I could create and I</v>

356
00:22:45.551 --> 00:22:47.230
<v Speaker 2>decided to just do things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

357
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:51.340
<v Speaker 2>and fear they would stop me if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have enough money,</v>

358
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.060
<v Speaker 2>which was probably a good way to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it because they did find money</v>

359
00:22:57.641 --> 00:22:58.750
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for various things.</v>

360
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.760
<v Speaker 2>But what was interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a,</v>

361
00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:04.360
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like being Miss America for</v>
<v Speaker 2>poetry.</v>

362
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.330
<v Speaker 2>And that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the poet laureate,</v>

363
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.170
<v Speaker 2>you have an immediate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

364
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.130
<v Speaker 2>cache and you have some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have stairs,</v>

365
00:23:15.131 --> 00:23:17.260
<v Speaker 2>people see you have some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>publicity,</v>

366
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:22.770
<v Speaker 2>some kind of a public stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought of myself as being more</v>

367
00:23:24.851 --> 00:23:25.900
<v Speaker 2>like a lightning rod.</v>

368
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.400
<v Speaker 2>People would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

369
00:23:27.401 --> 00:23:30.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a poet laureate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's ask her or</v>

370
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.100
<v Speaker 2>tell her what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got so many letters right from the</v>

371
00:23:36.101 --> 00:23:39.500
<v Speaker 2>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from people all over this country.</v>

372
00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:44.501
<v Speaker 2>He's telling me what I should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of them were really good ideas,</v>

373
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.260
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I couldn't implement all of them and</v>

374
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.250
<v Speaker 2>the time I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two years I was there,</v>

375
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:54.700
<v Speaker 2>the one thing that I found very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very helpful was to remember that many</v>

376
00:23:56.751 --> 00:23:59.660
<v Speaker 2>people are very frightened of poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as poet laureate,</v>

377
00:23:59.661 --> 00:24:04.661
<v Speaker 2>I had a chance to travel around to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>inject poetry in to everyday life</v>

378
00:24:05.601 --> 00:24:10.430
<v Speaker 2>whenever I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I visited grade school kids or</v>

379
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:13.220
<v Speaker 2>the naval academy and with all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>places where,</v>

380
00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:15.780
<v Speaker 2>where you thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

381
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.030
<v Speaker 2>didn't know they liked poetry or poetry</v>
<v Speaker 2>was absolutely necessary.</v>

382
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.260
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

383
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:26.350
<v Speaker 2>each poet laureate decide kind of what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they want to use that public arena.</v>

384
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:32.200
<v Speaker 2>And I decided to to try to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>be there and people's faces whenever the</v>

385
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.610
<v Speaker 2>they turned around to make poetry</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that was all around us.</v>

386
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.760
<v Speaker 2>I went on Sesame Street for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

387
00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:41.841
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

388
00:24:41.841 --> 00:24:43.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

389
00:24:43.641 --> 00:24:45.880
<v Speaker 2>it was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that happens with poet,</v>

390
00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:50.000
<v Speaker 2>the poet Laureateship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that when you are.</v>

391
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:55.720
<v Speaker 2>When I was in Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an opportunity to inject</v>

392
00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:01.960
<v Speaker 2>poetry into the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other lawyer does not have to</v>

393
00:25:01.971 --> 00:25:06.800
<v Speaker 2>write official poems or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were many occasions when I would</v>

394
00:25:06.801 --> 00:25:11.150
<v Speaker 2>be asked to say a few words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is of course a kind of a euphemism</v>

395
00:25:11.151 --> 00:25:11.481
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

396
00:25:11.481 --> 00:25:13.550
<v Speaker 2>you have a poem was there's always a</v>
<v Speaker 2>poem.</v>

397
00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:16.730
<v Speaker 2>You can always find a poem for almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>any human situation.</v>

398
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.360
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't write poems or for specific</v>
<v Speaker 2>events,</v>

399
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:21.860
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

400
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:27.370
<v Speaker 2>I could look and see if I had a poem</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would fit in that because I think</v>

401
00:25:29.211 --> 00:25:30.380
<v Speaker 2>that it's always important.</v>

402
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:35.380
<v Speaker 2>It's important if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a celebration for some bill</v>

403
00:25:36.951 --> 00:25:40.220
<v Speaker 2>being passed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nice to have a poem there to remind</v>

404
00:25:40.221 --> 00:25:43.880
<v Speaker 2>us all of the human element and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>human effort that went behind it.</v>

405
00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:46.580
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was important to,</v>

406
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:51.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

407
00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:56.180
<v Speaker 2>the Penguin Anthology of 20th century</v>
<v Speaker 2>American poetry</v>

408
00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.340
<v Speaker 2>is a Gargantuan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gargantuan project.</v>

409
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:03.080
<v Speaker 2>And basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

410
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to make sense poetically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the 20th century in America.</v>

411
00:26:09.321 --> 00:26:14.321
<v Speaker 2>So it starts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really right there with 'em</v>

412
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:22.630
<v Speaker 2>at Arlington Robinson and it goes up</v>
<v Speaker 2>until anything published in the year</v>

413
00:26:25.731 --> 00:26:27.440
<v Speaker 2>2000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying.</v>

414
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:32.470
<v Speaker 2>So what the difference in the center</v>
<v Speaker 2>algae is instead of just a poem here</v>

415
00:26:32.871 --> 00:26:37.871
<v Speaker 2>upon their two pubs where this person</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to give a sense of of major</v>

416
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 2>poets who then influenced other poets as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

417
00:26:44.251 --> 00:26:49.251
<v Speaker 2>so that we may be quite a few poems by</v>
<v Speaker 2>say let's choose someone William Carlos</v>

418
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Williams and then show how he influenced</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of other poets who may have a</v>

419
00:26:57.601 --> 00:27:00.870
<v Speaker 2>few other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as many poems in the oncology.</v>

420
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:06.200
<v Speaker 2>What makes a classic poem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that when a poem can move</v>

421
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:20.230
<v Speaker 2>readers across</v>
<v Speaker 2>generations and across its specific</v>

422
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.890
<v Speaker 2>class or race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it becomes truly classic.</v>

423
00:27:27.891 --> 00:27:28.581
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>

424
00:27:28.581 --> 00:27:33.581
<v Speaker 2>if the poem is so moving that even if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have no experience in that</v>

425
00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.470
<v Speaker 2>particular setting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be it 19 twenties,</v>

426
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:44.500
<v Speaker 2>Harlem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you still are so moved that,</v>

427
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:48.050
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can put yourself in that</v>

428
00:27:48.051 --> 00:27:52.010
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that the writer has managed</v>

429
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.790
<v Speaker 2>to go beyond the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

430
00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:59.930
<v Speaker 2>the personal and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and touch the humanity in all of us.</v>

431
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:05.720
<v Speaker 2>And it's been really a blast to read it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I realized how,</v>

432
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this does hold true for the truly</v>

433
00:28:08.961 --> 00:28:13.961
<v Speaker 2>great poems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Gosh,</v>

434
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:16.100
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a specific poem.</v>

435
00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.010
<v Speaker 2>There they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it changes,</v>

436
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.820
<v Speaker 2>changes depending on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

437
00:28:19.821 --> 00:28:22.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm working with,</v>

438
00:28:22.311 --> 00:28:24.770
<v Speaker 2>where I'm at at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

439
00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.260
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

440
00:28:27.261 --> 00:28:29.810
<v Speaker 2>they're just poems that are just so</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing to me.</v>

441
00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

442
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.220
<v Speaker 2>and if I named one that I course lose</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

443
00:28:34.221 --> 00:28:35.540
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

444
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.030
<v Speaker 2>it goes in and out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that.</v>

445
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.380
<v Speaker 3>Hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me think.</v>

446
00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:48.760
<v Speaker 2>I can't name a specific one lines flow</v>
<v Speaker 2>through my head.</v>

447
00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.133
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

448
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.960
<v Speaker 2>a very beautiful German poem by Gerta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I often say to myself because it's</v>

449
00:29:01.681 --> 00:29:05.610
<v Speaker 2>like a little prayer and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also totally untranslatable</v>

450
00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:09.690
<v Speaker 2>I've never been able to translate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

451
00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:14.250
<v Speaker 2>it's humbling because you realize the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need translators.</v>

452
00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:15.121
<v Speaker 2>Please,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please,</v>

453
00:29:15.121 --> 00:29:16.500
<v Speaker 2>please,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need our translators.</v>

454
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.050
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise we'll never have any of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>posts,</v>

455
00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:23.670
<v Speaker 2>would never know who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how bottom layer moves us or anything</v>

456
00:29:23.671 --> 00:29:27.100
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you also realize how much gets lost,</v>

457
00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:33.160
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how necessarily poetry is so bonded to</v>

458
00:29:34.021 --> 00:29:37.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the language in which it is composed</v>

459
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.930
<v Speaker 2>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

460
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.730
<v Speaker 2>you're always going to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I find that very humbling.</v>

461
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

462
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a wonderful woman that rhymes,</v>

463
00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:52.210
<v Speaker 2>but it rhymes in odd ways about other</v>
<v Speaker 2>gifts</v>

464
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.580
<v Speaker 2>and I live vip spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His Stu calm.</v>

465
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:04.100
<v Speaker 2>I'd how Baltimore binder who was out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

466
00:30:07.371 --> 00:30:10.290
<v Speaker 2>And you can hear the rhymes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically transfer it.</v>

467
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:15.310
<v Speaker 2>It says overall the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tranquility</v>

468
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:22.210
<v Speaker 2>rests</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all of the tips of the trees and</v>

469
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:23.950
<v Speaker 2>that's VIP for which is a great little</v>
<v Speaker 2>winter.</v>

470
00:30:23.951 --> 00:30:28.951
<v Speaker 2>All the tops of the trees you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can hardly feel a breath.</v>

471
00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.320
<v Speaker 2>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just wait.</v>

472
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube will rest.</v>

473
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.920
<v Speaker 2>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because of the minds that make this</v>

474
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:48.970
<v Speaker 2>such a calm and it's just in certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>words that totally untranslatable like</v>

475
00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:53.770
<v Speaker 2>vip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which does mean tips of the trees,</v>

476
00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.900
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't sound very good in</v>
<v Speaker 2>English,</v>

477
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:57.063
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

478
00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:02.130
<v Speaker 2>it's almost rocks you to sleep and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just find it incredibly amazing poem</v>

479
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.960
<v Speaker 2>tightness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet tranquility</v>

480
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:14.180
<v Speaker 2>could let me think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What could I do a longterm?</v>

481
00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:19.560
<v Speaker 2>I'll read one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll read a short one and a,</v>

482
00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:28.200
<v Speaker 2>but I have to give you a little gloss</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

483
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

484
00:31:35.141 --> 00:31:39.010
<v Speaker 2>This poem is from my new Book Sonata</v>
<v Speaker 2>Melodica,</v>

485
00:31:39.011 --> 00:31:41.110
<v Speaker 2>which tells the story of George Bridge</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tower,</v>

486
00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:45.610
<v Speaker 2>a Mulatto violinist from the 18th and</v>
<v Speaker 2>19th centuries.</v>

487
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.000
<v Speaker 2>In this poem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a prodigy.</v>

488
00:31:49.001 --> 00:31:53.590
<v Speaker 2>He's a little boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years old in England playing his</v>

489
00:31:53.591 --> 00:31:58.591
<v Speaker 2>violin in front of all of the music</v>
<v Speaker 2>lovers of London,</v>

490
00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:03.550
<v Speaker 2>and his father is sent back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sent away from London.</v>

491
00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.900
<v Speaker 2>The Prince of Wales says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take care of the little boy,</v>

492
00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:13.420
<v Speaker 2>and so you have this little boy who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>has the best job in the world for a</v>

493
00:32:13.421 --> 00:32:15.550
<v Speaker 2>musician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time he has no family,</v>

494
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:21.330
<v Speaker 2>and in this poem the prince has ordered</v>
<v Speaker 2>him to go into as women to change into</v>

495
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:28.120

<v Speaker 2>try to hook the tasseled tips into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>emerald sales of my set and pantaloons</v>

<v Speaker 2>Let me touch goodbye.</v>
