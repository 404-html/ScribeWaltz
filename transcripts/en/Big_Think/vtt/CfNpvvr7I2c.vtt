WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.870
<v Speaker 1>We all experience emotionally charged</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflicts,</v>

2
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>whether it's in the workplace with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleague,</v>

3
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 1>whether it's at home with a spouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's even in our country,</v>

4
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>dealing with political issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the challenges,</v>

5
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>how do we deal with them most</v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively.</v>

6
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my sense is that most people come in</v>

7
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>with like the quick fix answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>the rational approaches just listen a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit more,</v>

9
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>talk a little bit less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's useful,</v>

10
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:36.090
<v Speaker 1>but that's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beneath rationality is this other layer</v>

11
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>to the conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the emotional layer.</v>

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 1>You're starting to get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're colleague is starting to get</v>

13
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>angry and things start to fester,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even that is not the fundamental</v>

14
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:49.890
<v Speaker 1>force driving us in conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the core?</v>

15
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>It's identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>

16
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>what tends to fuel our emotions in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict is a threat.</v>

17
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Who we are and what we stand for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the moment I threaten what you</v>

18
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>deeply care about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden now we have a real</v>

19
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 1>emotionally charged conflict.</v>

20
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>So the moment your identity feels</v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened,</v>

21
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.640
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you fall prey to a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous mindset that I call the tribes</v>

22
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an US versus them mindset.</v>

23
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>You could be in a conflict with somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>you love your mother,</v>

24
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>your kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the moment you get into this</v>

25
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes me versus you,</v>

26
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>US versus them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about a conflict in your own life.</v>

27
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>There are three basic characteristics to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tribal mentality.</v>

28
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.140
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's adversarial.</v>

29
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.650
<v Speaker 1>It is me versus you to it's self</v>
<v Speaker 1>righteous.</v>

30
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I believe I am right and legitimate in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my perspective and I believe you are</v>

31
00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>wrong and crazy and element number</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

32
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>this tribes effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a closed system,</v>

33
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.590
<v Speaker 1>so I will argue and defend my</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective to no ends,</v>

34
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 1>but I am going to close my ears to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

35
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>This is the tribes effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fall into it in the family dynamic</v>

36
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>and unfortunately just as true national</v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamics,</v>

37
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>international dynamics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see the polarizations there.</v>

38
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Once you attach to a tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something strange happens.</v>

39
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Speaker 1>No longer is content as important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The substance of the arguments,</v>

40
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.140
<v Speaker 1>the the policies that is important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>

41
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.530
<v Speaker 1>the most important element in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a part of a tribe is loyalty,</v>

42
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>loyalty to the tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the most serious offense that you</v>

43
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:52.221
<v Speaker 1>can commit against your own tribe is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>betray that tribe's trust.</v>

44
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>It's loyalty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's essence.</v>

45
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>It's to go against the tribe in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

46
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>You look at the United States now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're these huge political divides.</v>

47
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>You see the democratic tribe or tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the Republican tribes as well,</v>

48
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>and it's very difficult for either side</v>
<v Speaker 1>to even say,</v>

49
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>I understand what you're saying because</v>
<v Speaker 1>some on the inside of each side are</v>

50
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 1>going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

51
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're betraying our tribe,</v>

52
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>and the moment betraying the tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a taboo.</v>

53
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.370
<v Speaker 1>If I break a taboo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can suffer social punishments.</v>

54
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be excommunicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be ridiculed or worse.</v>

55
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the challenge of our tribalistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>world that we're in right now.</v>

56
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>So you can have somebody in Trumpville</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Clintonville who,</v>

57
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.433
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>totally is getting hammered by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

59
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:45.310
<v Speaker 1>let's say in the trump world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because totally going to get hammered by</v>

60
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>the by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes to healthcare,</v>

61
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>but they're still in that camp because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're part of the tribe.</v>

62
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Recognizing that identity is critical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sort of opens our eyes to what might</v>

63
00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:59.140
<v Speaker 1>be going on in the world around us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>our communities around us.</v>

64
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Think about some of let's think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the issues that are in the</v>

65
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 1>public sphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abortion,</v>

66
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes,</v>

67
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 1>security of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these issues hit right to the</v>

68
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>core of our identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who we are and what we stand for.</v>

69
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.460
<v Speaker 1>And the moment I feel that any of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>elements is threatened now I moved</v>

70
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:26.140
<v Speaker 1>toward the tribes effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to move toward being with a</v>

71
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 1>group of people like myself who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to protect me and my interests</v>

72
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.180
<v Speaker 1>from becoming trampled on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a powerful tool you can do is to</v>

73
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.420
<v Speaker 1>emphasize the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two of us,</v>

74
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving from ego to we go,</v>

75
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 1>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a big difference watching</v>

76
00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:51.700
<v Speaker 1>conflict situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed something interesting,</v>

77
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at first people are battling it out,</v>

78
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:59.701
<v Speaker 1>my perspective versus yours and all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the energy is moving toward my ego and</v>

79
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:02.860
<v Speaker 1>my perspective versus your ego and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives.</v>

80
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>When you start to see the transition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what starts to happen is that each side</v>

81
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>recognizes there's also an us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's me and there's you,</v>

82
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:17.221
<v Speaker 1>but there's also the space between us</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are creating together and the</v>

83
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:21.880
<v Speaker 1>more you can emphasize the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you can move toward real</v>

84
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:26.260
<v Speaker 1>reconciliation or the two of you moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>together towards some cooperative and</v>

85
00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:29.060
<v Speaker 1>sustainable outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

86
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 1>looking at the rhetoric in the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States right now,</v>

87
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.080
<v Speaker 1>there's so much divisive rhetoric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are the voices of us,</v>

88
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>the United States of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the more you get those kinds of</v>

89
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:43.930
<v Speaker 1>voices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you can start to,</v>

90
00:05:43.931 --> 00:05:47.200
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overpower the US versus them thinking.</v>

91
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 1>We're not trying to overpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that the people have behind</v>

92
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.110
<v Speaker 1>their us versus them thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to overpower that</v>

93
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.610
<v Speaker 1>adversarial mindset.</v>

94
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.390
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
