1
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Well in the sense that I think we</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly understand that uh,</v>

2
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.150
<v Speaker 1>we cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.570
<v Speaker 1>we cannot continue to rely on petroleum</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a major source of energy.</v>

4
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Now there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two dimensions to our</v>

5
00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:28.940
<v Speaker 1>addiction to petroleum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

6
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.590
<v Speaker 1>let's start by saying that petroleum is</v>
<v Speaker 1>our largest single source of energy.</v>

7
00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:37.400
<v Speaker 1>About 40% of our energy comes from</v>
<v Speaker 1>petroleum.</v>

8
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.900
<v Speaker 1>This is higher than almost any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>major economic power.</v>

9
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Most of the countries rely on other</v>
<v Speaker 1>sources of energy or a,</v>

10
00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:50.300
<v Speaker 1>a bigger spread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a greater spectrum of energy.</v>

11
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:55.301
<v Speaker 1>We are very petroleum dependent and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is partly because we were once</v>

12
00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:59.600
<v Speaker 1>a major petroleum producer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was once abundant and cheap.</v>

13
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.700
<v Speaker 1>it was natural to rely on oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

15
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>but that ended in 1970 when we became a</v>
<v Speaker 1>net wet.</v>

16
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when our energy,</v>

17
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.010
<v Speaker 1>domestic energy production peaked and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>started relying on imports.</v>

18
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.570
<v Speaker 1>So we have a problem that we're very</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on petroleum.</v>

19
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Now there are two problems with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our dependence on petroleum.</v>

20
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.860
<v Speaker 1>One of one is that we have to get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

21
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.890
<v Speaker 1>from foreign countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that ties our foreign policy very</v>

22
00:01:33.021 --> 00:01:35.110
<v Speaker 1>much to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

23
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.540
<v Speaker 1>to obtaining more and more oil from</v>
<v Speaker 1>other countries,</v>

24
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 1>many of which are unfriendly or</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous or hostile.</v>

25
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.860
<v Speaker 1>And that has led to the militarization</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our foreign energy policy.</v>

26
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.490
<v Speaker 1>I have spoken a little bit about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.160
<v Speaker 1>on one hand and there's a high cost</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in that.</v>

28
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very big economic cost in the</v>

29
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:05.621
<v Speaker 1>sense that we are exporting more and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more dollars to pay for imported oil.</v>

30
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.300
<v Speaker 1>And those dollars that we spend our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the maybe the,</v>

31
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:17.301
<v Speaker 1>the largest single factor in our balance</v>
<v Speaker 1>of payments deficit and that's</v>

32
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:21.890
<v Speaker 1>contributing to the weakening of the US</v>
<v Speaker 1>style or with respect to other</v>

33
00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:25.310
<v Speaker 1>currencies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is contributing to the economic</v>

34
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>slowdown we're seeing in this country.</v>

35
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.860
<v Speaker 1>So our dependence on foreign oil is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

36
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other side of the coin or the</v>

37
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:39.101
<v Speaker 1>other dimension of this is that oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like other fossil fuels produces carbon</v>

38
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:43.820
<v Speaker 1>dioxide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And insofar as we continue to rely on</v>

39
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:46.580
<v Speaker 1>petroleum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to continue to emit carbon</v>

40
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:51.581
<v Speaker 1>dioxide into the atmosphere and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have a problem reducing our</v>

41
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 1>greenhouse gas emissions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have a double problem.</v>

42
00:02:56.361 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Now we want to cut back on carbon</v>
<v Speaker 1>dioxide emissions and we want to cut</v>

43
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 1>back on our reliance on imported</v>
<v Speaker 1>petroleum.</v>

44
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>And the only way to do that is to cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>back on our use of petroleum period.</v>

45
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.130
<v Speaker 1>And at this stage in the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really have no plan in place to do</v>

46
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I say,</v>

47
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these efforts,</v>

48
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for energy independence that rely on</v>

49
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 1>domestic sources of petroleum or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous delusion,</v>

50
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leading us to think there's a petroleum</v>

51
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no petroleum solution.</v>

52
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>There's only non-petroleum sooner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

53
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.530
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
