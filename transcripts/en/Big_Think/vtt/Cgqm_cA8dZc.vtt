1
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up,</v>

2
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I was born nearly 60 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was a child of the 60s,</v>

3
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:19.690
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sort of a rough blank.</v>

4
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really started growing up,</v>

5
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I think in the 70s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to lab rock kid,</v>

6
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.280
<v Speaker 1>but Dublin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland in them days,</v>

7
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.200
<v Speaker 1>it was a very dark place as in it was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very poor almost toward the world.</v>

8
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are going through economically,</v>

9
00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:43.210
<v Speaker 1>the whole world is going through a</v>
<v Speaker 1>recession at the moment while baby,</v>

10
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.260
<v Speaker 1>the 60s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 70s and the 80s in Ireland was a</v>

11
00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:50.350
<v Speaker 1>real recession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a pleasant place,</v>

12
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.060
<v Speaker 1>was massive unemployment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had huge political problems with the</v>

13
00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>north.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.570
<v Speaker 1>it was dull and gray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I formed a band and tried to</v>

15
00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:05.140
<v Speaker 1>escape it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a great country,</v>

16
00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:06.970
<v Speaker 1>a really beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great country,</v>

17
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>but it's had its troubles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the last 15 years we had one of the</v>

18
00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:15.130
<v Speaker 1>biggest economic booms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

19
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.080
<v Speaker 1>we became overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We became almost the wealthiest country</v>

20
00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:24.850
<v Speaker 1>in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And last year the bubble burst.</v>

21
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.180
<v Speaker 1>But I think a few bubbles of Burston a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few countries.</v>

22
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.430
<v Speaker 1>So we're all going through the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

23
00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:35.431
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's say Ireland in the 70s and the</v>

24
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.880
<v Speaker 1>80s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was tough.</v>

25
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.750
<v Speaker 1>But if you grow up with a tough</v>
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>

26
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.280
<v Speaker 1>like she's strong.</v>

27
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.810
<v Speaker 1>One of the biggest problems I find</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Irish politics and the economic</v>

28
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>thing was after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the war,</v>

29
00:01:56.061 --> 00:02:00.920
<v Speaker 1>after World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the European countries started</v>

30
00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:05.270
<v Speaker 1>to develop economically and socially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But whatever way,</v>

31
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:08.980
<v Speaker 1>the Catholic church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took a grip and they almost go over</v>

32
00:02:08.981 --> 00:02:10.610
<v Speaker 1>into the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

33
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:15.611
<v Speaker 1>we were almost like a dictatorship at</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's good and bad and,</v>

34
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.450
<v Speaker 1>but we experienced an awful lot of bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Speaker 1>especially from the institutions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught children to Christian brothers</v>

36
00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:28.640
<v Speaker 1>and Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all those stories are all coming out</v>

37
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.190
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just in Ireland and in Canada,</v>

38
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:35.360
<v Speaker 1>all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was pretty intense.</v>

39
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.570
<v Speaker 1>It was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Catholic church,</v>

40
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:41.780
<v Speaker 1>we're almost there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like our Edgar j hoover,</v>

41
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.000
<v Speaker 1>if you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ruled the roost,</v>

42
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.680
<v Speaker 1>but it had a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>profound influence on me in that as you</v>

43
00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:54.380
<v Speaker 1>get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize that you can't blame</v>

44
00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's good and bad and things get</v>

45
00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>missed directed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would call myself a black Catholic.</v>

46
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still have this attraction to it</v>

47
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.560
<v Speaker 1>because all religions I'm not a fan of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of sort of belief and</v>

48
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>spirituality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would be,</v>

49
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>I would be into Christ rather than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholics.</v>

50
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I was a very shy child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

51
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like the usual stuff that was</v>

52
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 1>shoved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sports were always shoved down yet.</v>

53
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.690
<v Speaker 1>And the Gaelic language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've actually disliked as a kid.</v>

54
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.623
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

55
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>as I grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I quite like it.</v>

56
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:44.551
<v Speaker 1>My real name isn't Gavin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was given Gavin Friday by my friends.</v>

57
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:47.220
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Christen phenomena and the V,</v>

58
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.560
<v Speaker 1>which is Gaelic and there's no actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>English translation and I hated it as a</v>

59
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:54.480
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as I,</v>

60
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 1>as I grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

61
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

62
00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My main influences were I loved,</v>

63
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:02.950
<v Speaker 1>I loved art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

64
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 1>it sounds a little pretentious to say I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was into art,</v>

65
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>but I like drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked music.</v>

66
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Music was my outlet from day one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

67
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I was giving you an image of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Ireland being this dull,</v>

68
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.710
<v Speaker 1>gray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive unemployment.</v>

69
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>And not much going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the future was the Dole Q,</v>

70
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

71
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me the window of hope was music and</v>

72
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:37.720
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I fell in love with sort of t rex and</v>

73
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 1>David Bowie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very young.</v>

74
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>And they sort of said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

75
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to live in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>north side of Dublin.</v>

76
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>That's all gray and depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be a spider and go to Mars.</v>

77
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.963
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.240
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

79
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm books too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read avidly as a kid.</v>

80
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the beautiful thing about</v>

81
00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 1>books and music and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even movies is that you can actually</v>

82
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:04.930
<v Speaker 1>escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

83
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 1>you can go into other worlds.</v>

84
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.970
<v Speaker 1>It's village was an imaginary place</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

85
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>It was the group of young guys that grew</v>
<v Speaker 1>up around the same area.</v>

86
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.910
<v Speaker 1>I grew up on a street called Cedar Wood</v>
<v Speaker 1>Road.</v>

87
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by coincidence,</v>

88
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.810
<v Speaker 1>my best friends that around the age of</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 became at a guide called Bano.</v>

89
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.490
<v Speaker 1>And another guy called Googie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

90
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 1>and we just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was music again,</v>

91
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>if I thought that that pulled us</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

92
00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>I lived in at the bottom end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street and they lived at the top end and</v>

93
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:50.800
<v Speaker 1>I was quite shy as a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

94
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.550
<v Speaker 1>but they find me quite interesting cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the right albums underneath my</v>

95
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:55.510
<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

96
00:05:55.511 --> 00:06:00.511
<v Speaker 1>those days where you carry the latest</v>
<v Speaker 1>bowie album or roxy music album as you</v>

97
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:03.340
<v Speaker 1>go to school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

98
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 1>you can't play an album at school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you were being cool just showing,</v>

99
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>look what I got and I'm not into</v>
<v Speaker 1>meatloaf.</v>

100
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm into Bowie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

101
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.250
<v Speaker 1>And so I attracted their attention and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had long hair and earrings when it was</v>

102
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 1>quite a risky thing to do in Dublin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we didn't have the liberation</v>

103
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:27.450
<v Speaker 1>that America and Britain had in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

104
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 1>in the 60s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did always look to England and</v>

105
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:35.300
<v Speaker 1>America mainly because of the music that</v>
<v Speaker 1>came from that.</v>

106
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.180
<v Speaker 1>But we became friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true music.</v>

107
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 1>And we had real names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

108
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:46.800
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon via Derek Roan on a dreadful</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine.</v>

109
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.550
<v Speaker 1>And Paul Hewson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

110
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 1>we gave each other nicknames just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way most kids do,</v>

111
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the nicknames,</v>

112
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:02.290
<v Speaker 1>I had more to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we physically looked or our essence.</v>

113
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.890
<v Speaker 1>And I had quite square features as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a young kid,</v>

114
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

115
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.790
<v Speaker 1>almost like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was the surge was add on,</v>

116
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.690
<v Speaker 1>on the TV is search pipe called</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

117
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.240
<v Speaker 1>And that used to just come wyvern piping</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this big square pipe would come.</v>

118
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can be full on at moments.</v>

119
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.880
<v Speaker 1>So I was called [inaudible] for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a bit sauce softer and a little</v>

120
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 1>softer than a [inaudible] search pipes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they changed that to Gavin?</v>

121
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't choose it as bundling.</v>

122
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Gogi you gave it to me and then Friday</v>
<v Speaker 1>was added because</v>

123
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.610
<v Speaker 1>I have a talent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting home at most people.</v>

124
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a bit of a man Friday thing and</v>

125
00:07:57.261 --> 00:07:59.900
<v Speaker 1>we gave each of these nicknames and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we,</v>

126
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.330
<v Speaker 1>we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had similar interests.</v>

127
00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:05.450
<v Speaker 1>We were into sounds really pretentious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 12,</v>

128
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.930
<v Speaker 1>13 year old kids were like into art and</v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry,</v>

129
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.840
<v Speaker 1>but we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we weren't into football,</v>

130
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 1>we weren't into making music or being</v>
<v Speaker 1>into music and painting and stuff like</v>

131
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:20.150
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we call this sort of little gang,</v>

132
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Lipton village and we made up imaginary</v>
<v Speaker 1>games and it's just one day we form</v>

133
00:08:25.201 --> 00:08:29.060
<v Speaker 1>bands and when they would make movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when they will do this and one day</v>

134
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:32.810
<v Speaker 1>we'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think a lot of kids do this in</v>

135
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:37.520
<v Speaker 1>their own way except 25,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years later,</v>

136
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.880
<v Speaker 1>legends happens because some of us have</v>
<v Speaker 1>become quite well known.</v>

137
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.660
<v Speaker 1>So the myth becomes magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that I tend to sort of see it very</v>

138
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:55.241
<v Speaker 1>practical for me when I go out for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink bottle combined the pints cause he</v>

139
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:59.010
<v Speaker 1>has more money than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're the same guys.</v>

140
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.990
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

141
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I've always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always done,</v>

142
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.003
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

143
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.053
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

144
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:14.090
<v Speaker 1>as a performer on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tend to sort of troll myself into the</v>

145
00:09:14.091 --> 00:09:16.000
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever I've written about.</v>

146
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 1>So it depends on how I'm writing or when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing about</v>

147
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.633
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

148
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.650
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of singers don't really know who</v>

149
00:09:24.651 --> 00:09:26.750
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sort of,</v>

150
00:09:26.751 --> 00:09:30.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this massive insecurity and</v>

151
00:09:30.891 --> 00:09:31.850
<v Speaker 1>there's massive</v>

152
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.123
<v Speaker 2>ego</v>

153
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.620
<v Speaker 1>and then sort of pulled the between</v>
<v Speaker 1>both.</v>

154
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you want a lot of the people to</v>

155
00:09:39.051 --> 00:09:43.070
<v Speaker 1>look at you all the time and listen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you something going on there.</v>

156
00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.630
<v Speaker 1>There's this sort of need to express and</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

157
00:09:47.631 --> 00:09:49.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not just ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

158
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:53.000
<v Speaker 1>it's some sort of complex thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you know,</v>

159
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.960
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you create characters to say something</v>

160
00:09:56.961 --> 00:10:00.770
<v Speaker 1>you want to say and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you just throw yourself into</v>

161
00:10:00.771 --> 00:10:03.500
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the last couple of years I've been</v>

162
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.970
<v Speaker 1>acting a lot more of the one or two</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

163
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.010
<v Speaker 1>I've done a lot of work with the Royal</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare Company.</v>

164
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Well that's been an intense baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that.</v>

165
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.090
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the way an Irish man that can</v>

166
00:10:17.091 --> 00:10:20.060
<v Speaker 1>hardly speak proper English is doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare.</v>

167
00:10:20.061 --> 00:10:22.640
<v Speaker 1>So I find that extraordinary as I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>older.</v>

168
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:27.590
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always see music,</v>

169
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.360
<v Speaker 1>live shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>performances as moments.</v>

170
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.620
<v Speaker 1>And to really get there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just got to actually get into the</v>

171
00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:38.270
<v Speaker 1>essence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flushing the blood.</v>

172
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Maurice Caesar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

173
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.880
<v Speaker 1>I worked with for a round from around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 87 till around 2004.</v>

174
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.270
<v Speaker 1>How long is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a long time.</v>

175
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:58.850
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started working in a club called the</v>

176
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Blue Jays as I started this club called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Blue Jays in,</v>

177
00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:01.994
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

178
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:07.180
<v Speaker 1>post and prunes and I painted for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years and then I needed that</v>

179
00:11:08.631 --> 00:11:12.620
<v Speaker 1>light I was telling you about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed that attention or I needed</v>

180
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.240
<v Speaker 1>to open up and show people what's inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

181
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

182
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.740
<v Speaker 1>so I wanted to perform again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a low key way.</v>

183
00:11:21.741 --> 00:11:25.850
<v Speaker 1>So I did this speakeasy sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vaudeville club called the Blue Jesus,</v>

184
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.240
<v Speaker 1>where I met up with Maurice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

185
00:11:28.241 --> 00:11:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I'd come from a sort of a punk rock</v>
<v Speaker 1>avant garde background.</v>

186
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.090
<v Speaker 1>But as I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I sort of ended the band,</v>

187
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:40.390
<v Speaker 1>I started like getting into more two</v>
<v Speaker 1>more sort of structured music and even</v>

188
00:11:40.431 --> 00:11:41.900
<v Speaker 1>classical and jazz.</v>

189
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started realizing,</v>

190
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:48.350
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before 1960 the was good music,</v>

191
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:49.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

192
00:11:49.891 --> 00:11:52.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided I wanted to work with somebody</v>

193
00:11:52.581 --> 00:11:56.020
<v Speaker 1>that was trained and Morris was</v>
<v Speaker 1>classically trained.</v>

194
00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.310
<v Speaker 1>So that journey we made three albums and</v>
<v Speaker 1>numerous,</v>

195
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:05.311
<v Speaker 1>numerous sidetrack and score and played</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 10 years of shows.</v>

196
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:09.610
<v Speaker 1>But it just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it w w you know,</v>

197
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Mara says playing with me this weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

198
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:18.120
<v Speaker 1>we're still friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just think the relationship came</v>

199
00:12:18.161 --> 00:12:23.110
<v Speaker 1>to an end spontaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to move to West Cork and plant</v>

200
00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:26.350
<v Speaker 1>trees with his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't</v>

201
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.930
<v Speaker 1>certain things kick in when you hit your</v>
<v Speaker 1>late forties and shit,</v>

202
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing really to do with me.</v>

203
00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.890
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going back years.</v>

204
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it was on some TV situation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archie and</v>

205
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.860
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people think a file.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's he out now?</v>

206
00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:51.940
<v Speaker 1>He's doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing,</v>

207
00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.290
<v Speaker 1>so what are you going to do next?</v>

208
00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:54.123
<v Speaker 1>And I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

209
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.610
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And honestly,</v>

210
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to get better.</v>

211
00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who do you want to work?</v>

212
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

213
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:01.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where would you play?</v>

214
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:02.830
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

216
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Legendary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place where music was when music was a</v>

217
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Carnegie Hall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just set it like that.</v>

218
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.510
<v Speaker 1>So became this sort of between my</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and different people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

235
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Once I'm with my friends and loved ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>and whatever.</v>

236
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.120
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're doing for your 50th.</v>

237
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

238
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:09.701
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

239
00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:12.610
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be working and you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta be making a show,</v>

240
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.570
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be working for red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

241
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.080
<v Speaker 1>when I have a few drinks on me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can talk,</v>

242
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:25.510
<v Speaker 1>but I shut up for the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was a little taken aback and it was</v>

243
00:14:25.511 --> 00:14:27.550
<v Speaker 1>sort of out of my control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

244
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.940
<v Speaker 1>what's this about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the guy who's putting the show</v>

245
00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:34.510
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how wilner I've worked with since 1988</v>

246
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.260
<v Speaker 1>and he's a little bit of a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

247
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.410
<v Speaker 1>that's an understatement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is a genius in my mind.</v>

248
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:47.310
<v Speaker 1>And I've done many of us collaborations</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shows and he gets it.</v>

249
00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Let's just see who wants to play with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

250
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dice up in the air and see what</v>

251
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:56.410
<v Speaker 1>comes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

252
00:14:56.411 --> 00:15:00.070
<v Speaker 1>you've seen the cost.</v>

<v Speaker 1>from Joe Grades,</v>

<v Speaker 1>chloe.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Laurie Anderson and I,</v>

263
00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.790
<v Speaker 1>after I leave this interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go to rehearse with Anthony</v>

264
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Haggerty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

265
00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.420
<v Speaker 1>for a few songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

266
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.920
<v Speaker 1>so what I'm most excited about is a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of music today is so over rehearsed,</v>

267
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:57.080
<v Speaker 1>so worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So unspontaneous these events,</v>

268
00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.310
<v Speaker 1>we've got three days of rehearsal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just putting in a lot of people</v>

269
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.900
<v Speaker 1>abduction and thoughts and emails and</v>
<v Speaker 1>letters and conversations.</v>

270
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:10.530
<v Speaker 1>But you're getting a group of musicians</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like a workshop that loved music</v>

271
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:15.700
<v Speaker 1>that are like pushing it out there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously doing something.</v>

272
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's a rare thing these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

273
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going to happen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that because in these days and</v>

274
00:16:25.631 --> 00:16:30.550
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is so ordered an anal and</v>

275
00:16:30.551 --> 00:16:35.551
<v Speaker 1>music is about spirits and spontaneity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we're going to do on</v>

276
00:16:35.621 --> 00:16:36.454
<v Speaker 1>Sunday night.</v>

277
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you think are going to live to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred?</v>

278
00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.040
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe bono can arrange that.</v>

279
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.660
<v Speaker 1>That would be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>bondo.</v>

283
00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.020
<v Speaker 1>honor that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know what's so great is that</v>

284
00:16:58.021 --> 00:17:01.220
<v Speaker 1>we're making money for AIDS and Africa</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

285
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.200
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot of love and spontaneity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing something creative.</v>

286
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.240
<v Speaker 1>That's what I love about Rad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

287
00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a charity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give us money,</v>

288
00:17:09.091 --> 00:17:11.160
<v Speaker 1>give us money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's being innovative.</v>

289

<v Speaker 1>here's a show,</v>

290
00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:18.090
<v Speaker 1>but you won't see anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can come and whatever you pay</v>

291
00:17:18.091 --> 00:17:20.010
<v Speaker 1>for your ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going somewhere.</v>

292
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.140
<v Speaker 1>You can go and buy a pair of our manny</v>
<v Speaker 1>shades like Bono,</v>

293
00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.500
<v Speaker 1>but the money goes to Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

294
00:17:28.501 --> 00:17:30.320
<v Speaker 1>it's quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

295
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually quite modest.</v>

296
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.410
<v Speaker 1>All of us as a nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all one is,</v>
