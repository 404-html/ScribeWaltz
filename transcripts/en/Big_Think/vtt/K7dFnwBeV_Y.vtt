00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.440
<v Speaker 1>I've got lots of things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that alarm me [inaudible] worry me and</v>

2
00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.700
<v Speaker 1>concerned me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I am,</v>

3
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm a rabid optimist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.550
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just keep seeing so many people doing</v>

6
00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:29.570
<v Speaker 1>cool things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.050
<v Speaker 1>I met a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have no idea whether this,</v>

8
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.050
<v Speaker 1>whether this technology is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>prove out.</v>

9
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I met a guy last summer who's</v>

10
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>working on a kind of concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.050
<v Speaker 1>cement portland cement is the basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>cement.</v>

12
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Portland cement is a real greenhouse gas</v>
<v Speaker 1>emitter.</v>

13
00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:49.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean construction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

14
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

15
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these numbers are going to be wrong,</v>

16
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:57.511
<v Speaker 1>but construction is 25% of greenhouse</v>
<v Speaker 1>gases and submit is 40% of construction,</v>

17
00:00:57.521 --> 00:00:59.680
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a big deal.</v>

18
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.000
<v Speaker 1>And he is invented this cement that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

19
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I think he's calling in California</v>
<v Speaker 1>summit that has</v>

20
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.390
<v Speaker 1>one 10th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

21
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>order of magnitude number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.350
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greenhouse gas emissions of this.</v>

23
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.000
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

24
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.720

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

25
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.510
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you hear Urbano speak,</v>

26
00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:23.170
<v Speaker 1>and I've heard Bano speak to 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people at my daughter's college</v>

27
00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:25.030
<v Speaker 1>graduation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've heard Bano speak to a group of</v>

28
00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:28.580
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 something managers in a small room</v>

29
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:33.010
<v Speaker 1>and you think this is the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>charismatic man I've ever met.</v>

30
00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:36.860
<v Speaker 1>And you think this is quite,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

35
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.580
<v Speaker 1>and then you meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.380
<v Speaker 1>people involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

37
00:01:47.381 --> 00:01:52.381
<v Speaker 1>in healthcare who are not getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in sort of sterile debates</v>

38
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.550
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

39
00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:55.870
<v Speaker 1>they're not out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not sterile,</v>

40
00:01:55.871 --> 00:01:56.531
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

41
00:01:56.531 --> 00:02:01.531
<v Speaker 1>but highly politicized debates about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the healthcare policy in the United</v>

42
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.091
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But her saying,</v>

43
00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:09.091
<v Speaker 1>if we go and apply the principles of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toyota production system to the</v>

44
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:14.740
<v Speaker 1>management of hospitals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can reduce by 90% the number of</v>

45
00:02:14.741 --> 00:02:19.741
<v Speaker 1>infections from introducing a central</v>
<v Speaker 1>line and we can improve by 50% the</v>

46
00:02:20.231 --> 00:02:23.530
<v Speaker 1>outcomes for people who have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who come into emergency rooms with heart</v>

47
00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:25.180
<v Speaker 1>attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think if we just do this,</v>

48
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.780
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

52
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.140
<v Speaker 1>when you see this kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
