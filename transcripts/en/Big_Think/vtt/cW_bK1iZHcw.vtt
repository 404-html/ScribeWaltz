00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>In 2014 I announced one of my boldest</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

2
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:05.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a company called Human Longevity</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inc.</v>

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Co founded it with Craig Venter,</v>

4
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:10.500
<v Speaker 1>the first guy sequenced the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>genome.</v>

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Bob Hariri,</v>

6
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>one of the top stem cell scientists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>businessmen in the world.</v>

7
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.830
<v Speaker 1>And we founded human longevity</v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporated as a means to extend the</v>

8
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:25.350
<v Speaker 1>healthy human lifespan to make a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

9
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:28.020
<v Speaker 1>And you're 60.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the first year of operations,</v>

10
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>we built the largest genome sequencing</v>
<v Speaker 1>facility in the world.</v>

11
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that genome sequencing facility</v>

12
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 1>besides your genome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>the 3.2 billion letters from your father</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the 3.2 billion letters from your</v>

14
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:43.770
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are also sequencing your microbiome.</v>

15
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>You are a collection of 10 trillion</v>
<v Speaker 1>human cells and a hundred trillion</v>

16
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>bacterial cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But besides that,</v>

17
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>you're full phenotype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

18
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Mri,</v>

19
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:57.530
<v Speaker 1>the full imaging of your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Metabolome,</v>

20
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>the 2,400 chemicals in your bloodstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this data is being collected.</v>

21
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.400
<v Speaker 1>And then we're using machine learning to</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine that data for the secrets of what</v>

22
00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>drives cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what drives heart disease,</v>

23
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 1>what drives neurodegenerative disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With a mission of making sure that when</v>

24
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>you're a hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look good,</v>

25
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>you move good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think good,</v>

26
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 1>you feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

27
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.520
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where we're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our ability to rapidly sequence a</v>

28
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 1>genome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take what was $100 million and nine</v>

29
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 1>months down to 1000 bucks in a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

30
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.900
<v Speaker 1>is going to unlock the secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are the product of our genome.</v>

31
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 1>How you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you sound,</v>

32
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.580
<v Speaker 1>the structures of your brain are all</v>
<v Speaker 1>coded for in our genes.</v>

33
00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:45.450
<v Speaker 1>So as we unlock this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to create tremendous</v>

34
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>breakthroughs in the healthy human</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifespan.</v>

35
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Inventing new drugs that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>personalized to you.</v>

36
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>It's going to reinvent health on an epic</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>
