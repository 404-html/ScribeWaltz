00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.263
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.700
<v Speaker 1>even the extravagant</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending proposals,</v>

3
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:17.610
<v Speaker 1>which is what I'm calling for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about on the order of four</v>

4
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>percent of GDP now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have debt.</v>

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.340
<v Speaker 1>I should check that number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe we have a debt GDP ratio and</v>

6
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>then 50 percent ish range right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

7
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>It's been rising in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

8
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>in the absence of a major war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not supposed to happen,</v>

9
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>but I look at other advanced countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've managed to have or ourselves.</v>

10
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>We had a debt to GDP ratio of 125</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent at the end of World War Two and</v>

11
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>paid it down and never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was never a question about the</v>

12
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>good faith and credit of the US</v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

13
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Even advanced countries with fairly weak</v>
<v Speaker 1>governments,</v>

14
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Belgium,</v>

15
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Italy have managed to have a debt debt</v>
<v Speaker 1>equal to or greater than GDP.</v>

16
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>So we have a lot of running room as long</v>
<v Speaker 1>as there's a reasonable presumption that</v>

17
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>we will in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do what's necessary to bring our</v>

18
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>finances under control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that we can't afford to spend</v>

19
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>this much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.010
<v Speaker 1>it's and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

21
00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:16.910
<v Speaker 1>the alternative not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not providing the stimulus is just to</v>

22
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>run the risk of a truly frightening.</v>
