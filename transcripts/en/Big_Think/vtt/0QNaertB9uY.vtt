1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.243
<v Speaker 2>I write every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get up around five or so and get two </v>

3
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:15.594
<v Speaker 2>little kids off to school and then I go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to work around nine and work until four </v>

4
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 2>o'clock or so and then do it pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

5
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.361
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish.</v>

6
00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get easier.</v>

7
00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:31.630
<v Speaker 2>It gets harder in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>

8
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.930
<v Speaker 2>you can't write the same book and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

9
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 2>that's always tempting to making a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentences is hard work.</v>

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.480
<v Speaker 2>You can't copy your own sentences and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't copy those of others.</v>

11
00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:47.314
<v Speaker 2>And so you're searching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're searching for a certain grace in </v>

12
00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:51.244
<v Speaker 2>a certain rhythm and melody that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath the pros that carries the </v>

13
00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:56.974
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

14
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 2>Great question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first answer that pops in my head is</v>

15
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:03.564
<v Speaker 2>absolutism certainty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm certain about very little in this </v>

16
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:11.110
<v Speaker 2>world and I just trust those who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a,</v>

17
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 2>I feel a stinker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The smell of,</v>

18
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.490
<v Speaker 2>of a blinders and of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>

19
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 2>compacity and pretentiousness that for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

20
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:23.600
<v Speaker 2>a companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

21
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.483
<v Speaker 2>certainty or a little bit of hype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hypocrisy also weaves its way through </v>

22
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:29.754
<v Speaker 2>absolutism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's so much of it around us on </v>

23
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every talk show seems to have it.</v>

24
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:35.334
<v Speaker 2>And in the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always encountering people who </v>

25
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.070
<v Speaker 2>declare things about the world I live in</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the certainty that I just don't,</v>

26
00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:48.080
<v Speaker 2>don't see around me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in my writing that shows.</v>

27
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.090
<v Speaker 2>That's why the issue of truth appears so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much throughout all of my books that I'm</v>

28
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.730
<v Speaker 2>skeptical of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

29
00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:57.390
<v Speaker 2>what's declared to be true?</v>

30
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't think pride is the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look,</v>

31
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.573
<v Speaker 2>I look at the book now 20 years after </v>
<v Speaker 2>having written it with a sense of </v>

32
00:02:06.491 --> 00:02:07.324
<v Speaker 2>dissociation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find it hard to believe that those </v>

33
00:02:11.051 --> 00:02:13.300
<v Speaker 2>stories are mine and those sentences are</v>
<v Speaker 2>mine.</v>

34
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.090
<v Speaker 2>And in a way they aren't any longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're part of a world of literature.</v>

35
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:24.091
<v Speaker 2>A book goes out and it takes on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it someone life,</v>

36
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:25.144
<v Speaker 2>but it's the own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the about illness and identity that is </v>

37
00:02:29.141 --> 00:02:31.090
<v Speaker 2>divorced from the person who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who made it.</v>

38
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.620
<v Speaker 2>And I feel sometimes even now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like a fraud that I know I wrote the</v>

39
00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:38.800
<v Speaker 2>book and intellectually I know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

40
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to read,</v>

41
00:02:41.681 --> 00:02:42.514
<v Speaker 2>it surprises me at times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>phrasal surprise me or an event will </v>

42
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:51.061
<v Speaker 2>surprise me and come at me a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit as a stranger's voice does.</v>

43
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 2>And in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am a stranger.</v>

44
00:02:54.851 --> 00:02:58.780
<v Speaker 2>The person who wrote that book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 20 years older and I've had 20 years</v>

45
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of new experiences,</v>

46
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.810
<v Speaker 2>children and things I never had before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that make that old voice seem old.</v>

47
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>

48
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:14.104
<v Speaker 2>It's life is eerily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uncannily echoed that final chapter </v>

49
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:19.234
<v Speaker 2>of the block where the timmy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little kid at the end of that book </v>

50
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.840
<v Speaker 2>was a forerunner to the author who wrote</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book.</v>

51
00:03:26.841 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 2>It's an effort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

52
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 2>as the story says at the end of say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little timmy is life.</v>

53
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.200
<v Speaker 2>I A little boy who grew up in a small </v>
<v Speaker 2>cow town in southern Minnesota and found</v>

54
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:38.644
<v Speaker 2>himself in a entangled and in Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not just in Vietnam and in hard </v>

55
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:49.051
<v Speaker 2>moral choices that it never had occurred</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me I'd ever faced in my life.</v>

56
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.093
<v Speaker 2>And the little naive lone ranger playing</v>
<v Speaker 2>timmy that became that soldier in </v>

57
00:03:57.641 --> 00:04:02.641
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam was a kind of stranger to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who wrote that book,</v>

58
00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:04.114
<v Speaker 2>the the middle aged me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just as now the author of the book </v>

59
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 2>seems a bit of a stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

60
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.360
<v Speaker 2>by bid off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

61
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking mysticism.</v>

62
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:17.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm simply saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

63
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 2>20 years is a long time to pass and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

64
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:22.543
<v Speaker 2>well when a sense of self changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of myself now primarily as a </v>

65
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:28.864
<v Speaker 2>father and secondarily as a writer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard those words come out of my </v>

66
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:34.474
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years ago it would have been </v>

67
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't want,</v>

68
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 2>kids didn't think it would be very much </v>
<v Speaker 2>fun,</v>

69
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 2>didn't think it would challenge me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it'd be kind of bored by it.</v>

70
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.930
<v Speaker 2>And now that is more of my life then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then a writing.</v>

71
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing intelligent behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

72
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a rationally planned </v>
<v Speaker 2>operation,</v>

73
00:04:57.161 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 2>but rather it's how the world comes at </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

74
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.513
<v Speaker 2>He comes at me and a mix of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination coming over here to do this </v>

75
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:05.854
<v Speaker 2>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm imagining will I meet and what will </v>

76
00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:08.664
<v Speaker 2>it be like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've never done a video interview </v>

77
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:11.284
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what will the physicality of the </v>

78
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 2>place be and all these and partly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>real world.</v>

79
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.830
<v Speaker 2>And I think that I'm not all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncommon in that.</v>

80
00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 2>I think we all live partly in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>daydreams.</v>

81
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:24.934
<v Speaker 2>And daydreams is the wrong word because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes it sound syrupy and mystically </v>

82
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I'd met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I partly mean daydreams and I partly</v>

83
00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:37.120
<v Speaker 2>mean just thought or anticipation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>event that hasn't yet occurred.</v>

84
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Speaker 2>And I think we all live there and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly live there in a situation such</v>

85
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 2>as a war where you're partly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

86
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 2>the reality of the world is in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

87
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.113
<v Speaker 2>But partly there's the wistful call of </v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriends and home and all the things </v>

88
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:55.510
<v Speaker 2>you don't have yearned for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're living,</v>

89
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 2>partly your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in a war.</v>

90
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.180
<v Speaker 2>And you'll flow in and out of these two </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you would maybe in a cancer ward</v>

91
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:10.090
<v Speaker 2>or if your marriage is collapsing or </v>
<v Speaker 2>your father has died or you're partly,</v>

92
00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:10.924
<v Speaker 2>he had the stark reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that corpse in that coffin and you have </v>

93
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:14.594
<v Speaker 2>partly remembering your dad's face as he</v>
<v Speaker 2>threw you a baseball or were even more </v>

94
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 2>poignantly to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my case,</v>

95
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 2>the wished that he were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm throwing you a baseball.</v>

96
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Kind of the invented throwing of a what </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't.</v>

97
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.640
<v Speaker 2>So I guess what I'm saying is that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't like,</v>

98
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 2>like everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

99
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:36.590
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

100
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.760
<v Speaker 2>didn't plan in a cerebral way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The form of the things they carried,</v>

101
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 2>it took advantage of what was natural to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

102
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean intentionally knew what I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

103
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 2>but I was taking advantage of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>really is pretty natural to me.</v>

104
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:55.511
<v Speaker 2>I live in at least those two worlds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination and a world we all live in.</v>

105
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.493
<v Speaker 2>Well through story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially what you hope is that when </v>

106
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:08.981
<v Speaker 2>you do what I do and you write novels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hoping for for a sense of feeling</v>

107
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:12.434
<v Speaker 2>to come through in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that through nonfiction the brain is </v>

108
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 2>engaged and the head is engaged </v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily not always just that,</v>

109
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:25.541
<v Speaker 2>but primarily and with fiction telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>invented stories.</v>

110
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.713
<v Speaker 2>The hope is that through the story or </v>
<v Speaker 2>read her lying in bed at night or you </v>

111
00:07:32.231 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading a book on the subway or the boss</v>

112
00:07:34.581 --> 00:07:39.581
<v Speaker 2>will sort of leave the bus and leave the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad and be transported to Madame Bovary,</v>

113
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:45.761
<v Speaker 2>his bedroom and you're kind of as there </v>
<v Speaker 2>half a witness and half a participant in</v>

114
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:47.924
<v Speaker 2>a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my hope is that those who read the </v>

115
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:51.620
<v Speaker 2>things they carried in my other books </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

116
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.933
<v Speaker 2>you hope that they'll feel sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That identification thing that happens </v>

117
00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 2>in a story where you're rooting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are,</v>

118
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:00.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoping the villain is cod or whatever </v>

119
00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 2>your emotional take on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in it.</v>

120
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:05.594
<v Speaker 2>And not just observing it the way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>observe CNN or you observed the Fox </v>

121
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:13.370
<v Speaker 2>channel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's discussed.</v>

122
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've ever tried to resolve</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

123
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:19.484
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one of those things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of resolves itself when I speak </v>

124
00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:28.391
<v Speaker 2>about Vietnam or when I write about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not my own,</v>

125
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>selfhood kind of evaporates.</v>

126
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.013
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in what's occurring on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the page and I'm interested in what's </v>

127
00:08:39.141 --> 00:08:39.974
<v Speaker 2>going to become of these characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm interested in the moral </v>

128
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.850
<v Speaker 2>struggles they're going through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't,</v>

129
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like my attention is on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>making of a,</v>

130
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:53.623
<v Speaker 2>of an object in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an artifact the way a sculptor may look </v>

131
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:57.270
<v Speaker 2>it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use of stone,</v>

132
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 2>and you may have a vision for what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want that stone to become,</v>

133
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:02.394
<v Speaker 2>but part of what you do is it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stolen kind of lead you to what it's </v>

134
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.193
<v Speaker 2>going to become.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vain of minerals may run through it and </v>

135
00:09:12.011 --> 00:09:12.601
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

136
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:14.700
<v Speaker 2>that's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could become this.</v>

137
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.533
<v Speaker 2>And that's been like writing fiction and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit of dialogue may pop out of the </v>

138
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:23.931
<v Speaker 2>character's mouth that's unplanned and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unintentional on my part,</v>

139
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:26.010
<v Speaker 2>I have no volition over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to,</v>

140
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:26.943
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter,</v>

141
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.103
<v Speaker 2>well I know that I'm coming from </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere inside my head and my history </v>

142
00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:34.690
<v Speaker 2>and my imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't affect,</v>

143
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.050
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't feel as if I'm willing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm making it happen by volition.</v>

144
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.160
<v Speaker 2>It's appearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

145
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.760
<v Speaker 2>stories have a way of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of pulling you along,</v>

146
00:09:44.761 --> 00:09:48.030
<v Speaker 2>kind of chasing the story as you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing it.</v>

147
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:49.790
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

148
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:50.773
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't feel as if I'm playing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>old childhood game of connecting dots </v>

149
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.890
<v Speaker 2>that they've all been planned and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>just going to write sentences to connect</v>

150
00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:01.560
<v Speaker 2>it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels more as if I'm on a,</v>

151
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:07.030
<v Speaker 2>on a riverboat and watching people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>scenery go by and a novel or a story has</v>

152
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:11.214
<v Speaker 2>that feel of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a voyage in which I'm partly a </v>

153
00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:16.200
<v Speaker 2>participant in partly a witness.</v>

154
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.190
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could say yes cause it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much big thinking,</v>

155
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.623
<v Speaker 2>but it is the act of writing for me is </v>
<v Speaker 2>largely the act of following sentences </v>

156
00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:31.854
<v Speaker 2>and making sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for most people that probably is a </v>

157
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.580
<v Speaker 2>time to click off and look at something </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

158
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:43.581
<v Speaker 2>But unfortunately for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories grow out of a sentence.</v>

159
00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sentence,</v>

160
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:46.230
<v Speaker 2>this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

161
00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:50.490
<v Speaker 2>one of my stories I wrote the sentence </v>
<v Speaker 2>was I had no idea of what,</v>

162
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.440
<v Speaker 2>what was true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

163
00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:53.910
<v Speaker 2>In what sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>

164
00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:56.460
<v Speaker 2>And I wrote another sentence to follow </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

165
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.620
<v Speaker 2>But a buddy in Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he and Bob Kiley,</v>

166
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:04.610
<v Speaker 2>well I'm discovering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably discovering and a partly just</v>

167
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.970
<v Speaker 2>curious about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are fascinated about issues of what,</v>

168
00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:12.804
<v Speaker 2>what could be true and what does this </v>
<v Speaker 2>character going to say is true and does </v>

169
00:11:16.891 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 2>this character really mean it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it really mean it's true?</v>

170
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.840
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what degree does this character think</v>

171
00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:29.370
<v Speaker 2>it's true and how could anybody say this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is true and real without a little tongue</v>

172
00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:32.220
<v Speaker 2>in cheek action going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>

173
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.263
<v Speaker 2>it's a discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I think was one of my better </v>

174
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:38.910
<v Speaker 2>stories grew out holy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the unplanned,</v>

175
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 2>out of a scrap of language is forgotten </v>
<v Speaker 2>by readers.</v>

176
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:43.554
<v Speaker 2>I think that are largely forgotten that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are 26 letters in the alphabet and </v>

177
00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.170
<v Speaker 2>some punctuation marks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's all we've got.</v>

178
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:57.640
<v Speaker 2>And that is what I work with fitting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my underwear day after day,</v>

179
00:11:57.641 --> 00:11:59.860
<v Speaker 2>year after year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 26 letters.</v>

180
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.753
<v Speaker 2>He's punctuation marks and out of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>character is calm and moral quandaries </v>

181
00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:11.761
<v Speaker 2>are explored but in the end the work of </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing and fortunately I was really the</v>

182
00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:13.114
<v Speaker 2>battling with Abcd and that's comma that</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in calcitrant there are those and it </v>

183
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:21.514
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a function of age and it </v>

184
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:26.170
<v Speaker 2>probably wasn't even a function entirely</v>
<v Speaker 2>of of uh,</v>

185
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.600
<v Speaker 2>education or political leanings.</v>

186
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.200
<v Speaker 2>But there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a temper in probably America,</v>

187
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:38.140
<v Speaker 2>but for sure I know in America and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>worldwide for the literal,</v>

188
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:39.563
<v Speaker 2>a literal take on everything that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality TV is taken advantage of and </v>

189
00:12:43.961 --> 00:12:48.961
<v Speaker 2>incorporated as part of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the literal take on things is a take</v>

190
00:12:52.361 --> 00:12:54.760
<v Speaker 2>without irony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without edge and without,</v>

191
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:59.080
<v Speaker 2>it's usually a fairly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a certitude to it.</v>

192
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:00.483
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you write a book that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with war is that that's a </v>

193
00:13:03.161 --> 00:13:03.994
<v Speaker 2>certain possibility and you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly try to do it as a way of </v>

194
00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:10.120
<v Speaker 2>recovering from the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you want to say a number of things.</v>

195
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:14.590
<v Speaker 2>This is not just a book about war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you idiot.</v>

196
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.760
<v Speaker 2>And it's a book about love and a book </v>
<v Speaker 2>about storytelling.</v>

197
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.493
<v Speaker 2>But you also feel overwhelmed by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the knowledge that you're not going </v>

198
00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:27.244
<v Speaker 2>to get through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the literal minded are going to </v>

199
00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:32.500
<v Speaker 2>remain literal minded and maybe someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else can help them,</v>

200
00:13:32.501 --> 00:13:34.660
<v Speaker 2>but that someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

201
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.153
<v Speaker 2>not this guy.</v>

202
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:41.410
<v Speaker 2>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a wave of anger or bitterness.</v>

203
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.073
<v Speaker 2>It has to do with Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to do with a kind of mindset of the </v>

204
00:13:48.941 --> 00:13:53.941
<v Speaker 2>literal all around me that doesn't fit </v>
<v Speaker 2>my take on the world.</v>

205
00:13:54.611 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my experience in the world where it's</v>

206
00:13:59.321 --> 00:14:02.380
<v Speaker 2>hard for me to take anything very </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally boards.</v>

207
00:14:02.381 --> 00:14:04.540
<v Speaker 2>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have there as soon as they're uttered,</v>

208
00:14:04.541 --> 00:14:08.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much and when will you stop and will</v>

209
00:14:08.801 --> 00:14:09.730
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

210
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.170
<v Speaker 2>in what way do you love me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what is love to you,</v>

211
00:14:14.171 --> 00:14:16.970
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that forever or is it still an ex,</v>

212
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

213
00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:22.720
<v Speaker 2>passenger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff complicates where someone</v>

214
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:25.090
<v Speaker 2>else's I will love is love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't know what it is,</v>

215
00:14:25.091 --> 00:14:26.620
<v Speaker 2>you're really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're poor guy.</v>

216
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:32.250
<v Speaker 2>And that's their take partly is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably,</v>

217
00:14:32.981 --> 00:14:36.100
<v Speaker 2>I tried to skewer it at parody it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make fun of it,</v>

218
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.960
<v Speaker 2>ridicule it and put it in his place.</v>

219
00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Partly I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sympathetic to the literal that is,</v>

220
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:44.543
<v Speaker 2>I'm sympathetic with some mom is holding</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dead kid in her arms and how else is </v>

221
00:14:49.391 --> 00:14:52.340
<v Speaker 2>she to take it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's my dead child.</v>

222
00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a part of me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>understands it and is sympathetic to it.</v>

223
00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.890
<v Speaker 2>And probably the better part of me is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that why,</v>

224
00:14:59.891 --> 00:15:03.410
<v Speaker 2>where I have that at least at least some</v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to,</v>

225
00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:06.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asic much novelists kind of have to have</v>

226
00:15:06.681 --> 00:15:07.514
<v Speaker 2>to imagine otherness outside oneself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as a consequence of my books are </v>

227
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.650
<v Speaker 2>filled with characters who bear no </v>
<v Speaker 2>resemblance to me and,</v>

228
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.150
<v Speaker 2>and can be villainous in ways I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>villainous.</v>

229
00:15:23.151 --> 00:15:23.984
<v Speaker 2>And it can be good in ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not good that I think the capacity </v>

230
00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:28.934
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for empathy or understanding goes with </v>

231
00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:39.281
<v Speaker 2>the successful book because you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create other characters and other angles</v>

232
00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:42.044
<v Speaker 2>of vision on material for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a book to ring it ring with some </v>

233
00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:50.411
<v Speaker 2>kind of authenticity among my fellow </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers in Vietnam.</v>

234
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:51.463
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was and remains to this day</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of absence of that kind of empathy </v>

235
00:15:56.151 --> 00:15:56.984
<v Speaker 2>or a dead child as a dead [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead Vietnamese woman or one of their </v>

236
00:16:01.161 --> 00:16:06.080
<v Speaker 2>legs blown off was a woman with goop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with their legs blown off.</v>

237
00:16:06.081 --> 00:16:09.890
<v Speaker 2>And it pretty much remains that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>these days,</v>

238
00:16:09.891 --> 00:16:10.724
<v Speaker 2>40 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those same buddies I served with in </v>

239
00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:17.861
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam don't have much empathy for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

240
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:24.730
<v Speaker 2>so called enemy and I doubt they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be capable of because,</v>

241
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:27.710
<v Speaker 2>because that's there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>

242
00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:28.544
<v Speaker 2>writing the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they carried it write another book that </v>

243
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:36.230
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be a much different book.</v>

244
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:44.210
<v Speaker 2>I ran into a kid in Seattle or kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>26 year old,</v>

245
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a book that,</v>

246
00:16:46.941 --> 00:16:47.774
<v Speaker 2>a book signing and I saw him out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner of my eye standing in the corner </v>

247
00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:54.890
<v Speaker 2>and was kind of frightened by him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not In physically,</v>

248
00:16:54.891 --> 00:16:55.760
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

249
00:16:55.761 --> 00:17:00.500
<v Speaker 2>I hope it's not a manuscript he's got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me and that which is hell of course</v>

250
00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:01.334
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the guy that finally this reading </v>

251
00:17:04.101 --> 00:17:04.934
<v Speaker 2>Andoni hung around and I could feel him </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the corner of my eye approached </v>

252
00:17:07.311 --> 00:17:09.470
<v Speaker 2>me and he had me sign his book and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

253
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.200
<v Speaker 2>You began to leave and then he turned </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and he said,</v>

254
00:17:12.201 --> 00:17:17.201
<v Speaker 2>I think he knew my father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as he said those words,</v>

255
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.970
<v Speaker 2>I knew who the kid was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw it in his face,</v>

256
00:17:19.971 --> 00:17:24.971
<v Speaker 2>his cause he was dad and that kid's face</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was my platoon leader in Vietnam.</v>

257
00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:27.523
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he told me over the course of the </v>

258
00:17:31.671 --> 00:17:32.520
<v Speaker 2>next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

259
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:33.373
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes or half hour that he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kid had been searching for his </v>

260
00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:37.874
<v Speaker 2>father ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His father committed suicide soon after </v>

261
00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:42.240
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

262
00:17:42.241 --> 00:17:47.241
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had looked for his dad in very brave,</v>

263
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.943
<v Speaker 2>cool ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had joined the army just to see what </v>

264
00:17:50.581 --> 00:17:52.780
<v Speaker 2>his father had gone through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really become a green beret.</v>

265
00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:57.781
<v Speaker 2>As soon as dad had been a ranger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this tuff snake eating,</v>

266
00:17:58.381 --> 00:18:00.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff.</v>

267
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:06.000
<v Speaker 2>And he had picked up my first book and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's father figures in the book,</v>

268
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:11.030
<v Speaker 2>not been always in the most laudatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>way is in fact not in laudatory ways.</v>

269
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that encounter,</v>

270
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we want to cry,</v>

271
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.543
<v Speaker 2>if I weren't on camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be a little tears in my eyes now </v>

272
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.750
<v Speaker 2>because it's an example of why I began </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing in the first place.</v>

273
00:18:30.751 --> 00:18:35.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to touch people in a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

274
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:36.743
<v Speaker 2>that stories can touch him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had helped in a very modest way </v>

275
00:18:43.501 --> 00:18:44.334
<v Speaker 2>for this fellow to fill in a gap of who </v>
<v Speaker 2>this man advantage committed suicide </v>

276
00:18:47.911 --> 00:18:48.744
<v Speaker 2>before they even knew his father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His father killed himself when he was </v>

277
00:18:50.641 --> 00:18:51.530
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

278
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like six months older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight months,</v>

279
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:56.460
<v Speaker 2>very young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

280
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.920
<v Speaker 2>encounters like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remind me of why began.</v>

281
00:19:01.921 --> 00:19:04.380
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to forget why you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you become a writer.</v>

282
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:05.663
<v Speaker 2>Letters I'll get from me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the girlfriends and people in Iraq or </v>

283
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan or the children,</v>

284
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.150
<v Speaker 2>which all say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

285
00:19:14.151 --> 00:19:15.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad,</v>

286
00:19:15.081 --> 00:19:17.660
<v Speaker 2>he won't talk about it or my mom in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>cases,</v>

287
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.870
<v Speaker 2>but largely men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>

288
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.063
<v Speaker 2>I read your book and now I know at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>something and when he's carrying around </v>

289
00:19:24.531 --> 00:19:27.680
<v Speaker 2>with them and what do you won't talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

290
00:19:27.681 --> 00:19:28.514
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes the book will be shared </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the veteran and conversation will </v>

291
00:19:34.971 --> 00:19:35.804
<v Speaker 2>ensue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is way beyond anything I </v>

292
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:43.710
<v Speaker 2>intended hinder writing in that book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't intend to bring people together</v>

293
00:19:43.711 --> 00:19:45.020
<v Speaker 2>or it's Darren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking.</v>

294
00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.220
<v Speaker 2>But it shows you the power of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of literature.</v>

295
00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:50.054
<v Speaker 2>It can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really touches individual people </v>

296
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:57.430
<v Speaker 2>realize and the real world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributes to their lives.</v>

297
00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:03.180
<v Speaker 2>It does something to their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

298
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.720
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I dreamed of.</v>

299
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:10.280
<v Speaker 2>I began riding home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreamed of touching some 15 year old kid</v>

300
00:20:10.281 --> 00:20:14.390
<v Speaker 2>and dubuque or some grieving mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

301
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:15.463
<v Speaker 2>Harlem,</v>

302
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:19.403
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literature makes you feel if it's any </v>

303
00:20:21.411 --> 00:20:23.690
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can make you feel a little less alone</v>

304
00:20:23.691 --> 00:20:24.524
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone else has gone through this and </v>

305
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:32.400
<v Speaker 2>it gives you some late night company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

306
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.340
<v Speaker 2>with your memories and your thorough </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature is,</v>

307
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:38.783
<v Speaker 2>does touch people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just to be read in English </v>

308
00:20:40.251 --> 00:20:45.251
<v Speaker 2>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't physically put a person.</v>

309
00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:47.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

310
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.570
<v Speaker 2>I've often thought of what a cool movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be.</v>

311
00:20:49.571 --> 00:20:51.970
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to a war movie and they out of</v>

312
00:20:51.971 --> 00:20:56.950
<v Speaker 2>the screen come real bullets and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>ducking and you'd get a where it's not,</v>

313
00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.673
<v Speaker 2>you're not shielded by the knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm not going to die in this movie </v>

314
00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:04.504
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

315
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.940
<v Speaker 2>or at least that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bullets aren't going to do it.</v>

316
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can't do that,</v>

317
00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:10.813
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you rely as you probably do in </v>

318
00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:16.570
<v Speaker 2>anything you're relying on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the human,</v>

319
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.753
<v Speaker 2>the reader or the audience's imagination</v>
<v Speaker 2>to just sort of suspend the knowledge </v>

320
00:21:24.281 --> 00:21:27.610
<v Speaker 2>that I'm not going to die inside this </v>
<v Speaker 2>book or at this movie.</v>

321
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.403
<v Speaker 2>But you have almost start to seduce the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reader or the audience into almost </v>

322
00:21:34.991 --> 00:21:35.824
<v Speaker 2>forgetting that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost forgetting that feel of danger </v>

323
00:21:38.281 --> 00:21:41.560
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a good work of art.</v>

324
00:21:41.561 --> 00:21:45.220
<v Speaker 2>There's a movie called the Messenger </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's recently come out about the,</v>

325
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.790
<v Speaker 2>with Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

326
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.070
<v Speaker 2>and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a war movie and away,</v>

327
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:51.933
<v Speaker 2>although none of it happens in war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the notification of next of kin </v>

328
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.480
<v Speaker 2>where they knock on doors and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your son's dad or your husband's gone.</v>

329
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.401
<v Speaker 2>And although,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

330
00:22:00.401 --> 00:22:02.410
<v Speaker 2>in the theater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just,</v>

331
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actors and so on.</v>

332
00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:06.003
<v Speaker 2>There's a bluntness and a brutality in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>horror to it that some of those way </v>

333
00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:14.620
<v Speaker 2>beyond John Wayne stuff and the actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>war stuff,</v>

334
00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:17.590
<v Speaker 2>which has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of expect what's coming.</v>

335
00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:18.424
<v Speaker 2>And so Laura,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are going to die and you harden </v>

336
00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.490
<v Speaker 2>yourself to it and they do.</v>

337
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:25.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a different experience to watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>those knuckles on the door and that fate</v>

338
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:27.460
<v Speaker 2>door open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if that face,</v>

339
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.640
<v Speaker 2>that person die in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that mother,</v>

340
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

341
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.440
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

342
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.300
<v Speaker 2>what are just for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's for.</v>

343
00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:41.163
<v Speaker 2>It's for cutting through rhetoric and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cutting through politics and cutting </v>

344
00:22:46.751 --> 00:22:49.980
<v Speaker 2>through convention to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

345
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.513
<v Speaker 2>open a trap door in your soul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the avowed purposes behind our or </v>

346
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.810
<v Speaker 2>preemptive in more and Iraq or let's get</v>
<v Speaker 2>rid of weapons of mass destruction.</v>

347
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.420
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm pretty clear on my memory on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

348
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there weren't any,</v>

349
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.100
<v Speaker 2>and it's a bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go to war because we were attacked</v>

350
00:23:15.101 --> 00:23:15.934
<v Speaker 2>at Pearl Harbor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a Pearl Harbor hadn't happened and </v>

351
00:23:18.401 --> 00:23:22.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm astonished that this large seemed </v>
<v Speaker 2>largely forgotten.</v>

352
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:25.450
<v Speaker 2>Seems are raced from the public </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse about the war.</v>

353
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.333
<v Speaker 2>I don't hear many people going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>television saying we went to war for </v>

354
00:23:30.251 --> 00:23:31.810
<v Speaker 2>reasons that didn't exist.</v>

355
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:33.633
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel any outrage coming from </v>

356
00:23:35.201 --> 00:23:36.610
<v Speaker 2>anybody I hadn't done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't,</v>

357
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.220
<v Speaker 2>not only do I not feel it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never felt it.</v>

358
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:41.373
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that stunning and I do here </v>

359
00:23:46.011 --> 00:23:47.180
<v Speaker 2>instead as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

360
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.570
<v Speaker 2>we got rid of a tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saddam Hussein.</v>

361
00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:54.050
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that is that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first place,</v>

362
00:23:54.051 --> 00:23:56.450
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't the reason we went to war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't do know,</v>

363
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.523
<v Speaker 2>didn't go before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The United Nations is saying let's get </v>

364
00:23:58.911 --> 00:23:59.744
<v Speaker 2>rid of a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went before saying their weapons of </v>

365
00:24:00.801 --> 00:24:01.634
<v Speaker 2>mass destruction and there was no </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyranny stuff there except in the most </v>

366
00:24:04.581 --> 00:24:08.720
<v Speaker 2>second hand and trivialized kind of way </v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

367
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:12.920
<v Speaker 2>But beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing called consistency.</v>

368
00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.200
<v Speaker 2>And there's another thing called </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypocrisy.</v>

369
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.620
<v Speaker 2>And if the object is to get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrants around the world,</v>

370
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:24.190
<v Speaker 2>why aren't we nuking Red Shyna what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to let the Republicans used to call</v>

371
00:24:24.231 --> 00:24:25.064
<v Speaker 2>Red China and why aren't we at war with </v>
<v Speaker 2>half the countries in Latin America and </v>

372
00:24:28.641 --> 00:24:32.030
<v Speaker 2>why aren't we taking half the countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Africa if not more than half?</v>

373
00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.113
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are no answers to those </v>

374
00:24:37.521 --> 00:24:38.354
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of Cherry pick your war and go get </v>

375
00:24:41.121 --> 00:24:44.780
<v Speaker 2>rid of that tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the question of ty,</v>

376
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.180
<v Speaker 2>ty origin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose eyes,</v>

377
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:51.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what if for example,</v>

378
00:24:51.501 --> 00:24:52.334
<v Speaker 2>al Qaeda were to declare a George Bush </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a tyrant and we're going to attack </v>

379
00:24:57.231 --> 00:24:58.640
<v Speaker 2>you or are we all going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

380
00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.540
<v Speaker 2>come tax us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay to attack tyrants.</v>

381
00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:05.490
<v Speaker 2>Who declares that the tire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is who we are.</v>

382
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:06.343
<v Speaker 2>Well we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been elected as a country to </v>

383
00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:10.010
<v Speaker 2>decide who the tyrants are and who the </v>
<v Speaker 2>good guys are.</v>

384
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.133
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are complicated questions and </v>

385
00:25:14.301 --> 00:25:16.520
<v Speaker 2>they're not addressed and not even </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at anymore.</v>

386
00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.081
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

387
00:25:18.081 --> 00:25:19.220
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

388
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.380
<v Speaker 2>that's part of where my frustration </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes,</v>

389
00:25:21.381 --> 00:25:22.410
<v Speaker 2>I think in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

390
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:23.893
<v Speaker 2>writing about this subject is I feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>that things have been de elevated in </v>

391
00:25:29.971 --> 00:25:33.470
<v Speaker 2>that the discourse is aimed at a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>low,</v>

392
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:34.333
<v Speaker 2>low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low place and difficult questions are </v>

393
00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:39.050
<v Speaker 2>not just not answered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not even asked.</v>

394
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.023
<v Speaker 2>And they aren't asked by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't seem to have been asked by the </v>

395
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:48.170
<v Speaker 2>people who uttering the bellicose </v>
<v Speaker 2>rhetoric of war.</v>

396
00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.360
<v Speaker 2>You seem to be alighted innovated.</v>

397
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.253
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the final issue that </v>

398
00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:00.320
<v Speaker 2>kind of attend your question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the issue of personal,</v>

399
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:04.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to phrase this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a pr,</v>

400
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.253
<v Speaker 2>a personal commitment to one's own </v>
<v Speaker 2>rhetoric that the rhetoric of </v>

401
00:26:10.551 --> 00:26:11.384
<v Speaker 2>bellicosity that's or has surrounded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the initial phases of our </v>

402
00:26:15.201 --> 00:26:19.070
<v Speaker 2>intervention in the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people aren't there.</v>

403
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.510
<v Speaker 2>They aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

404
00:26:20.511 --> 00:26:21.344
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

405
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.340
<v Speaker 2>the Cheney's and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

406
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.160
<v Speaker 2>the public face and the public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

407
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:33.280
<v Speaker 2>explainers of our presence in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too often they're hiding their kids away</v>

408
00:26:34.011 --> 00:26:37.710
<v Speaker 2>at Yale or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or wherever and they're,</v>

409
00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.250
<v Speaker 2>they're not putting their bodies with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their rhetoric is,</v>

410
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:44.760
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing to sit in a TV studio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're cute bow tie and say,</v>

411
00:26:44.761 --> 00:26:47.520
<v Speaker 2>let's go kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's another thing to go and do it.</v>

412
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.000
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't go send your daughter </v>
<v Speaker 2>or your son,</v>

413
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.210
<v Speaker 2>they got to go and they've got an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just go there.</v>

414
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:54.990
<v Speaker 2>You gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

415
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.823
<v Speaker 2>walk the streets and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and drive the vehicles and risk maiming </v>

416
00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:09.711
<v Speaker 2>and death and the hypocrisy of saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great thing to go kill people.</v>

417
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:12.930
<v Speaker 2>But if somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go do it,</v>

418
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my kids aren't,</v>

419
00:27:14.341 --> 00:27:18.200
<v Speaker 2>but you go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After having gone through a war myself,</v>

420
00:27:18.201 --> 00:27:23.201
<v Speaker 2>I find that that's still stirs in me in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same way it did 40 years ago.</v>

421
00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:26.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an anger that's hard to,</v>

422
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.590
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to keep my voice under </v>
<v Speaker 2>controls.</v>

423
00:27:28.591 --> 00:27:31.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

424
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:36.760
<v Speaker 2>because it seems so dishonest and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>cowardly and,</v>

425
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:42.480
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so evil than the end.</v>

426
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.300
<v Speaker 2>It is in part that and part to mimic our</v>
<v Speaker 2>collective memories.</v>

427
00:27:51.301 --> 00:27:53.640
<v Speaker 2>All of us that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

428
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:56.430
<v Speaker 2>memories of strange thing that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it,</v>

429
00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.330
<v Speaker 2>how much of today do I remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

430
00:28:00.331 --> 00:28:02.460
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's already abstracted,</v>

431
00:28:02.461 --> 00:28:03.570
<v Speaker 2>but I've already hook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

432
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.930
<v Speaker 2>utterly obliterated almost every </v>
<v Speaker 2>syllable to come out of my mouth.</v>

433
00:28:06.931 --> 00:28:08.370
<v Speaker 2>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's history.</v>

434
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.800
<v Speaker 2>What about yesterday?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>

435
00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Every dish I washed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every scab I picked,</v>

436
00:28:13.051 --> 00:28:17.240
<v Speaker 2>every rich person I encountered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

437
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:18.103
<v Speaker 2>it's every meal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ate three hundreds and thousands of </v>

438
00:28:21.271 --> 00:28:24.180
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that out of my life,</v>

439
00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:27.620
<v Speaker 2>99%,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a lot more than that.</v>

440
00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.390
<v Speaker 2>It's been erased that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

441
00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:30.940
<v Speaker 2>biliterate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>erase canton.</v>

442
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.950
<v Speaker 2>Remember a detail and I'm not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about childhood,</v>

443
00:28:34.951 --> 00:28:39.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about adulthood and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've cared deeply about it.</v>

444
00:28:39.261 --> 00:28:44.261
<v Speaker 2>And I remember them and loving ways and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet have a few snapshots of memory.</v>

445
00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.370
<v Speaker 2>And we hold onto those and we call a </v>
<v Speaker 2>memory.</v>

446
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:53.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little remnant of,</v>

447
00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.460
<v Speaker 2>of a lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's left to us.</v>

448
00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:02.360
<v Speaker 2>And we attach this word memory to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which sounds has a sound of encompassing</v>

449
00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:07.881
<v Speaker 2>all but it doesn't and that's certainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>applies to the things they carried.</v>

450
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.013
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a book partly about memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The author of that book is an older guy </v>

451
00:29:14.881 --> 00:29:19.590
<v Speaker 2>and he's looking back and he's recycling</v>
<v Speaker 2>event from different angles,</v>

452
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:24.720
<v Speaker 2>sometimes inventing things as a way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeking that which is,</v>

453
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:28.620
<v Speaker 2>is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

454
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:33.750
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've ghostly a good friendship.</v>

455
00:29:33.961 --> 00:29:38.961
<v Speaker 2>Merrick's who stepped on a landmine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>was blown into this tree and uh,</v>

456
00:29:40.081 --> 00:29:45.081
<v Speaker 2>he's been dead a long and yet in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing of the things they carried,</v>

457
00:29:45.731 --> 00:29:50.150
<v Speaker 2>I tried to in some way resurrect through</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination what his last thoughts may a</v>

458
00:29:50.151 --> 00:29:54.430
<v Speaker 2>man as he soared into that tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's sunlight is killing me.</v>

459
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:55.683
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm making it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm trying to sort of cast a light </v>

460
00:29:59.741 --> 00:30:00.574
<v Speaker 2>on that which has been darkened by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a history and the passage of time to </v>

461
00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:10.210
<v Speaker 2>let chip keeps soaring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

462
00:30:10.211 --> 00:30:11.920
<v Speaker 2>use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as that book is read,</v>

463
00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:14.860
<v Speaker 2>that Guy's going to keep soaring into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that hedge for,</v>

464
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under that tree.</v>

465
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.183
<v Speaker 2>And as long as the book is routed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little Linda at the end of the book is </v>

466
00:30:20.231 --> 00:30:21.064
<v Speaker 2>going to keep skating on that ice and </v>
<v Speaker 2>little timmy will be in love with her </v>

467
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:31.951
<v Speaker 2>and the skating along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is what you don't,</v>

468
00:30:35.381 --> 00:30:36.214
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not saving their bodies and I'm </v>

469
00:30:37.391 --> 00:30:39.820
<v Speaker 2>not even saving the memories of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people really.</v>

470
00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:45.220
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saving something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that's essential and enduring and</v>

471
00:30:45.221 --> 00:30:46.054
<v Speaker 2>the human spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the love of a little boy for a little </v>

472
00:30:48.821 --> 00:30:53.500
<v Speaker 2>girl and a good friend who soared into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tree and a terrible war.</v>

473
00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.350
<v Speaker 2>And that's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not everything,</v>

474
00:30:56.351 --> 00:31:01.351
<v Speaker 2>but it's something mostly pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

475
00:31:02.171 --> 00:31:03.004
<v Speaker 2>I'm a come down on that side of there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a mythology that accompanies the memory </v>

476
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:12.820
<v Speaker 2>of an event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by and large from my fellow soldiers</v>

477
00:31:12.821 --> 00:31:15.300
<v Speaker 2>in Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mythologies of betrayal,</v>

478
00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.760
<v Speaker 2>we were betrayed by government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't pursue it,</v>

479
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.660
<v Speaker 2>were betrayed by the liberal press.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

480
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.020
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't our doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

481
00:31:23.021 --> 00:31:26.680
<v Speaker 2>they're doing the same way that after </v>
<v Speaker 2>World War One,</v>

482
00:31:26.681 --> 00:31:31.000
<v Speaker 2>the Germans were preached to by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces of,</v>

483
00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:33.100
<v Speaker 2>became Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

484
00:31:33.101 --> 00:31:34.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were betrayed after the end of world</v>

485
00:31:34.721 --> 00:31:37.510
<v Speaker 2>war on Germany was sold down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by and large,</v>

486
00:31:37.511 --> 00:31:42.160
<v Speaker 2>my buddy's feel that why that a we could</v>
<v Speaker 2>have won the war if only there were more</v>

487
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.600
<v Speaker 2>people weren't killed and more women </v>
<v Speaker 2>raped and more houses burned,</v>

488
00:31:45.601 --> 00:31:48.240
<v Speaker 2>we would have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

489
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they feel that way.</v>

490
00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you could have paved the country</v>

491
00:31:52.691 --> 00:31:55.710
<v Speaker 2>with the concrete and put up a big fence</v>
<v Speaker 2>around it.</v>

492
00:31:55.711 --> 00:31:58.330
<v Speaker 2>I used to have all these people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't watch it.</v>

493
00:31:58.331 --> 00:32:01.240
<v Speaker 2>There you are Americans and were </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vietnamese and this is our country.</v>

494
00:32:01.241 --> 00:32:05.140
<v Speaker 2>And you may have the concrete and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moms and the technology,</v>

495
00:32:05.141 --> 00:32:10.141
<v Speaker 2>but you're not gonna win us when us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may have won a war in a way.</v>

496
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

497
00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.393
<v Speaker 2>I think there were mythologies of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of memory and my dad carried with him </v>

498
00:32:19.181 --> 00:32:22.810
<v Speaker 2>out of World War II mythology of </v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

499
00:32:22.811 --> 00:32:27.811
<v Speaker 2>the lone ranger and the doer of good and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the carrier of democratic flame.</v>

500
00:32:30.221 --> 00:32:31.054
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

501
00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:36.930
<v Speaker 2>there was a head of undercurrent of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost a soundtrack of Frank Sinatra,</v>

502
00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Gene Kelly soundtrack running beneath </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

503
00:32:40.891 --> 00:32:41.724
<v Speaker 2>of buoyancy and of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of virtue and the soundtrack that ran </v>

504
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:48.530
<v Speaker 2>beneath the movie of Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

505
00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:49.373
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all your people are going to watch </v>

506
00:32:51.351 --> 00:32:56.351
<v Speaker 2>this smell was not that I'll be seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>you sentimental journey soundtrack.</v>

507
00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:57.974
<v Speaker 2>It was a soundtrack of the doors and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stones and it was an edgy and critical </v>

508
00:33:04.491 --> 00:33:08.120
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a much more ambiguous,</v>

509
00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:13.360
<v Speaker 2>a soundtrack that more or less </v>
<v Speaker 2>accurately reflected the ambiguities and</v>

510
00:33:15.981 --> 00:33:17.300
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

511
00:33:17.301 --> 00:33:18.134
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the absence of a certain moral </v>

512
00:33:23.421 --> 00:33:26.990
<v Speaker 2>underpinnings to that enterprise that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

513
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.113
<v Speaker 2>so those are two pretty different </v>
<v Speaker 2>edifices of what's called a mythology </v>

514
00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:36.374
<v Speaker 2>about a war and mythology as a way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminating all that doesn't fit into </v>

515
00:33:41.001 --> 00:33:41.834
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

516
00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.790
<v Speaker 2>you sort of eliminate that part of it.</v>

517
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:47.623
<v Speaker 2>I think there's probably some truth in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the notion that there is an insidious </v>

518
00:33:51.471 --> 00:33:55.100
<v Speaker 2>and dangerous side of the mythology </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's surrounds Vietnam.</v>

519
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:56.703
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a slight stink of the hip and of </v>

520
00:34:00.051 --> 00:34:02.250
<v Speaker 2>the cool of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

521
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.720
<v Speaker 2>walking the dangerous line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

522
00:34:05.721 --> 00:34:08.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a,</v>

523
00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.113
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an exotic feel to the war and </v>

524
00:34:13.621 --> 00:34:17.790
<v Speaker 2>this far off jungle and that was part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

525
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:21.980
<v Speaker 2>The mythology around it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of beckon is beckon is one a new</v>

526
00:34:21.981 --> 00:34:22.814
<v Speaker 2>to the adventure and we have my exotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced and dangerous moment that </v>

527
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:29.533
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that manages to erase the absolute </v>

528
00:34:33.801 --> 00:34:38.801
<v Speaker 2>horror of it all the dead people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dead children and just the horror,</v>

529
00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:42.963
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that maybe part of what every writer </v>

530
00:34:46.341 --> 00:34:47.174
<v Speaker 2>about war is finally had to come to </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms with in one way or another that </v>

531
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.150
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty great books had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>written,</v>

532
00:34:53.151 --> 00:34:53.984
<v Speaker 2>including the Iliad and the Odyssey that</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't ended wars and Evan did entity </v>

533
00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:03.790
<v Speaker 2>appetite for it and probably won't all </v>
<v Speaker 2>you always hope.</v>

534
00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:06.973
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I this little son of mine who's now </v>

535
00:35:10.521 --> 00:35:12.350
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name is tad and he,</v>

536
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:15.180
<v Speaker 2>the week or two ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

537
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.560
<v Speaker 2>I said I was going on a book tour and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>said no about what,</v>

538
00:35:18.561 --> 00:35:19.394
<v Speaker 2>and I explained what the things they </v>
<v Speaker 2>carried was and for the first time he </v>

539
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:23.894
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had encountered out of my mouth the </v>

540
00:35:26.191 --> 00:35:27.024
<v Speaker 2>word war in a personal way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is probably heard me say it before </v>

541
00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:32.820
<v Speaker 2>he said war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

542
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.450
<v Speaker 2>you mean really killing people with for </v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

543
00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:40.900
<v Speaker 2>And so for real you said really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really killed people that I began</v>

544
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:46.140
<v Speaker 2>by saying and now people are getting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreements and trying to simplify it.</v>

545
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:47.833
<v Speaker 2>But the astonishment on a four year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old's face that people are killing one </v>

546
00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:53.100
<v Speaker 2>another man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

547
00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:54.803
<v Speaker 2>for what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And boy that was hard to articulate an </v>

548
00:35:56.851 --> 00:35:58.550
<v Speaker 2>answer to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a header.</v>

549
00:35:58.650 --> 00:35:59.483
<v Speaker 2>You're know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have an answer the answer I </v>

550
00:36:01.891 --> 00:36:02.630
<v Speaker 2>believe they had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

551
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know for what.</v>

552
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

553
00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:14.380
<v Speaker 2>I was the lime of person who has thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>about this stuff my entire adult life.</v>

554
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:20.800
<v Speaker 2>I really haven't yet plumbed the for </v>
<v Speaker 2>wetness of,</v>

555
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:26.280
<v Speaker 2>of killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

556
00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I ever will.</v>

557
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:37.070
<v Speaker 2>Plumbing one of the huge things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course there's,</v>

558
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:40.160
<v Speaker 2>there's no draft and the people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>

559
00:36:40.161 --> 00:36:44.210
<v Speaker 2>are in the armed forces out of volition </v>
<v Speaker 2>and got her own,</v>

560
00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.120
<v Speaker 2>we'll decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's pretty huge.</v>

561
00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:51.350
<v Speaker 2>It attracts a certain temperament that </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't mine.</v>

562
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.920
<v Speaker 2>That kind of can do macho,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adventurous,</v>

563
00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>temperament.</v>

564
00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:58.603
<v Speaker 2>Then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patriotism feeds in very strongly as </v>

565
00:37:00.711 --> 00:37:03.090
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

566
00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:04.423
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty big difference from the </v>

567
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.620
<v Speaker 2>people who went to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

568
00:37:09.621 --> 00:37:12.200
<v Speaker 2>there were many volunteers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course I went to Vietnam,</v>

569
00:37:12.201 --> 00:37:14.050
<v Speaker 2>but there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bulk of us were drafted you,</v>

570
00:37:14.051 --> 00:37:18.950
<v Speaker 2>so probably more or less went </v>
<v Speaker 2>reluctantly and,</v>

571
00:37:18.951 --> 00:37:21.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my case a lot more than less.</v>

572
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:27.790
<v Speaker 2>And so the two wars are being fought by </v>
<v Speaker 2>American soldiers.</v>

573
00:37:28.191 --> 00:37:32.090
<v Speaker 2>I need side that have pretty different </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperaments.</v>

574
00:37:32.091 --> 00:37:34.340
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

575
00:37:34.341 --> 00:37:35.174
<v Speaker 2>did an article offer a big magazine </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I was sent to Brooke Army Medical </v>

576
00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.450
<v Speaker 2>Center in San Antonio where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>

577
00:37:44.451 --> 00:37:47.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amputees or Sandton and burn victims,</v>

578
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.670
<v Speaker 2>and I felt great compassion for these </v>
<v Speaker 2>young men and one young woman,</v>

579
00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:54.960
<v Speaker 2>but auto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're miles there.</v>

580
00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:55.940
<v Speaker 2>There,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

581
00:37:55.941 --> 00:37:56.774
<v Speaker 2>there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of the irony that accompanied the </v>

582
00:38:00.831 --> 00:38:02.990
<v Speaker 2>war from my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my generation.</v>

583
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:04.743
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no questioning of the rectitude </v>

584
00:38:06.771 --> 00:38:09.680
<v Speaker 2>of the war whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

585
00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.760
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't even a thought about it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as I could tell if I quit.</v>

586
00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.713
<v Speaker 2>No response to my question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you ever wonder about there were no </v>

587
00:38:16.971 --> 00:38:18.950
<v Speaker 2>weapons of mass destruction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did that bother you?</v>

588
00:38:18.951 --> 00:38:22.970
<v Speaker 2>And the answer was in uniformly from </v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

589
00:38:22.971 --> 00:38:25.250
<v Speaker 2>many miles a flat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

590
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:27.200
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't even think about it.</v>

591
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:29.530
<v Speaker 2>But even that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think about it.</v>

592
00:38:29.531 --> 00:38:31.010
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was just no,</v>

593
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.290
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

594
00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.193
<v Speaker 2>there was none of the edgy feel of </v>
<v Speaker 2>questioning or of ambiguity was that </v>

595
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:40.114
<v Speaker 2>certainty thing we began with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was there and those young people's </v>

596
00:38:43.391 --> 00:38:47.800
<v Speaker 2>needs are horribly maim people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horribly wounded.</v>

597
00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.880
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

598
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:51.543
<v Speaker 2>instead coming out of their mouths were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were words such as wounded warrior and </v>

599
00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:59.410
<v Speaker 2>war against global terror.</v>

600
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:05.110
<v Speaker 2>It was going to military sloganeering </v>
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

601
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:10.210
<v Speaker 2>was part of their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who they were and that,</v>

602
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.420
<v Speaker 2>that was one another one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences from my,</v>

603
00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:17.500
<v Speaker 2>from my time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the odd things when the guest,</v>

604
00:39:17.501 --> 00:39:18.334
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the great ironies is that the </v>

605
00:39:19.391 --> 00:39:23.620
<v Speaker 2>things they carried is a book is one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things being carried around Iraq and</v>

606
00:39:23.621 --> 00:39:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan and finding out that book is</v>
<v Speaker 2>passed around from soldier to soldier.</v>

607
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:30.363
<v Speaker 2>And which gives me a little bit of hope </v>
<v Speaker 2>that at least they're getting something </v>

608
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:39.241
<v Speaker 2>from another point of view and which was</v>
<v Speaker 2>mine and that,</v>

609
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.610
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good for me.</v>

610
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

611
00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.550
<v Speaker 2>I saw such a simple minded guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

612
00:39:51.551 --> 00:39:54.520
<v Speaker 2>I just assume that in most ways there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no difference,</v>

613
00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:56.253
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the faces here younger and the bodies </v>

614
00:39:58.091 --> 00:40:02.560
<v Speaker 2>are leaner and because like the habits </v>
<v Speaker 2>are better than in my generation.</v>

615
00:40:02.561 --> 00:40:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Nobody smokes anymore or very few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Everybody.</v>

616
00:40:06.191 --> 00:40:10.050
<v Speaker 2>They know about the right foods to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody looks a little sleeker than in</v>

617
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:11.283
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the girls look prettier and the guys </v>

618
00:40:12.881 --> 00:40:15.310
<v Speaker 2>look tougher and tougher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but buffer.</v>

619
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but aside from that,</v>

620
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:20.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

621
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.233
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can hang out with college kids or </v>

622
00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:26.780
<v Speaker 2>people in their 20s and feel utterly at </v>
<v Speaker 2>home and in,</v>

623
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:32.280
<v Speaker 2>in a way that I don't think I could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>felt at home where I 26 hanging out with</v>

624
00:40:32.801 --> 00:40:33.341
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

625
00:40:33.341 --> 00:40:34.540
<v Speaker 2>it was Kurt Vonnegut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

626
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:35.374
<v Speaker 2>I think I would felt ill at ease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a poised among young </v>

627
00:40:40.451 --> 00:40:41.590
<v Speaker 2>people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

628
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.250
<v Speaker 2>really does astonish me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really astonishes me that way.</v>

629
00:40:45.251 --> 00:40:48.380
<v Speaker 2>People can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can uh,</v>

630
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:51.670
<v Speaker 2>do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so difficult for me,</v>

631
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:54.910
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not sure what to say exactly.</v>

632
00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fear it more than anything.</v>

633
00:41:01.451 --> 00:41:02.890
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're,</v>

634
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.050
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're put on the spot too,</v>

635
00:41:05.051 --> 00:41:08.500
<v Speaker 2>are articulate things about something in</v>
<v Speaker 2>progress that,</v>

636
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:12.790
<v Speaker 2>that have the danger of freezing you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as you say it enough times,</v>

637
00:41:12.791 --> 00:41:15.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this and then you damn well </v>
<v Speaker 2>better do it.</v>

638
00:41:15.131 --> 00:41:16.690
<v Speaker 2>He started telling yourself all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've said,</v>

639
00:41:16.691 --> 00:41:17.524
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to write this book and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be that kind of book and it </v>

640
00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.420
<v Speaker 2>freezes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It freezes you.</v>

641
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:23.563
<v Speaker 2>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're reluctant to go beyond it or </v>

642
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:27.910
<v Speaker 2>pushing another direction with the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

643
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

644
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.593
<v Speaker 2>I know enough about what I'm working on </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that it's a book about being an </v>

645
00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:35.024
<v Speaker 2>older father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 63 and I got these two young kids </v>

646
00:41:37.521 --> 00:41:38.354
<v Speaker 2>and I can say that it's about some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that I was writing about with </v>

647
00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:44.330
<v Speaker 2>the things they carried.</v>

648
00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:50.270
<v Speaker 2>The sense of your own mortality is </v>
<v Speaker 2>presses in on you in a war.</v>

649
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:50.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

650
00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:51.813
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know intellectually you're going to </v>

651
00:41:52.671 --> 00:41:53.504
<v Speaker 2>die someday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a war you're reminded pretty </v>

652
00:41:55.671 --> 00:42:00.410
<v Speaker 2>often and it was right at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel that way is an older father.</v>

653
00:42:00.411 --> 00:42:01.244
<v Speaker 2>I imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where am I going to be 10 years from </v>

654
00:42:02.211 --> 00:42:02.781
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

655
00:42:02.781 --> 00:42:06.800
<v Speaker 2>basketball is going to be tough and will</v>
<v Speaker 2>I even be alive?</v>

656
00:42:06.801 --> 00:42:11.801
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two little boys or so,</v>

657
00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:13.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

658
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:17.840
<v Speaker 2>nothing of tombstones and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

659
00:42:17.841 --> 00:42:20.780
<v Speaker 2>nothing of the tick of biology are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

660
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:26.080
<v Speaker 2>are facing it as I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a sadness to it that's has,</v>

661
00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:30.650
<v Speaker 2>that's accompanied by an exhilaration of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moments matter.</v>

662
00:42:30.651 --> 00:42:33.050
<v Speaker 2>And I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking advantage of them,</v>

663
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.190
<v Speaker 2>which is what I meant earlier about </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing that I'd rather,</v>

664
00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.313
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could die tomorrow and I as a writer </v>

665
00:42:42.681 --> 00:42:47.681
<v Speaker 2>be content with four or five of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>books I've written as being good,</v>

666
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:53.390
<v Speaker 2>but I can't die and be content about </v>
<v Speaker 2>these two unformed lives or aren't.</v>

667
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:54.583
<v Speaker 2>They're too young to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I want to try to be there to watch </v>

668
00:42:58.291 --> 00:43:00.290
<v Speaker 2>him become good and to do what I can to </v>
<v Speaker 2>help.</v>

669
00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:02.293
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

670
00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:06.470
<v Speaker 2>so I'm writing with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's funnier than that funder.</v>

671
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:10.070
<v Speaker 2>Funny things in it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the discovery of language and,</v>

672
00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:10.913
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the storytelling part of the book is </v>

673
00:43:14.661 --> 00:43:18.110
<v Speaker 2>about the stories I tell these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

674
00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.210
<v Speaker 2>there's sources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

675
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:25.190
<v Speaker 2>partly in the world of now and partly in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world of long ago.</v>

676
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:31.130
<v Speaker 2>What do I carry?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I carry a lot of years.</v>

677
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.100
<v Speaker 2>I feel that our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not all bad.</v>

678
00:43:34.101 --> 00:43:37.220
<v Speaker 2>It's partly bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I carry a,</v>

679
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:39.043
<v Speaker 2>what I think I probably was probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>come through in this talk we've had </v>

680
00:43:42.711 --> 00:43:47.711
<v Speaker 2>today as a kind of delight and in doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I do and a believer in doing what I</v>

681
00:43:52.401 --> 00:43:57.290
<v Speaker 2>do along with a sadness about doing what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

682
00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:01.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because two decades later,</v>

683
00:44:01.971 --> 00:44:02.804
<v Speaker 2>I'm fielding many of the questions about</v>
<v Speaker 2>war that I fielded all those years ago </v>

684
00:44:06.921 --> 00:44:07.741
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom,</v>

685
00:44:07.741 --> 00:44:08.600
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

686
00:44:08.601 --> 00:44:09.434
<v Speaker 2>that sort of back where we were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then some that that's feels like a </v>

687
00:44:14.661 --> 00:44:17.180
<v Speaker 2>tangible burden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

688
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:20.810
<v Speaker 2>but I carry with me these two kids I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned.</v>

689
00:44:20.811 --> 00:44:22.880
<v Speaker 2>And even though they're not physically </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

690
00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:23.733
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all around me and the person I </v>

691
00:44:26.671 --> 00:44:31.671
<v Speaker 2>become and they're living inside me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

692
00:44:32.221 --> 00:44:37.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I carry a slight,</v>

693
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:42.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>palpable feeling of obligation to,</v>

694
00:44:45.451 --> 00:44:46.284
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do justice to the savagery I witnessed </v>

695
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:54.750
<v Speaker 2>and the senselessness of it.</v>

696
00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:56.513
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

697
00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:58.513
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

698
00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:03.390
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sadness of it and it would,</v>

699
00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:08.570
<v Speaker 2>so that sense of obligation is with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially on occasion is like,</v>

700
00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:13.650
<v Speaker 2>like this one we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to talk lucidly about this stuff.</v>

701
00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:15.403
<v Speaker 2>After you do justice to chip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I muddy and to the ghosts of the dead </v>

702
00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.393
<v Speaker 2>Vietnamese and get Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially their mothers and dads who </v>

703
00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:30.660
<v Speaker 2>are still bearing the burden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though their kids are along that,</v>

704
00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:31.494
<v Speaker 2>I doubt they go to sleep many nights </v>
<v Speaker 2>without some poor woman in Orlando or </v>

705
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:37.243
<v Speaker 2>remembering or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Sana 40 years ago that she never got </v>

706
00:45:40.561 --> 00:45:45.561
<v Speaker 2>the ever hold again and there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty solid,</v>

707
00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:47.970
<v Speaker 2>solemn obligation.</v>
