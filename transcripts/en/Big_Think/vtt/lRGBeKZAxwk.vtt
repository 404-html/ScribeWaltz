1
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 2>people often ask me how my parents</v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced me and I can't give a neutral</v>

3
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 2>answer to that because I very much</v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced by saying by Hans,</v>

4
00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 2>I think that the biggest influence that</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents have on their children is at the</v>

5
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 2>moment of conception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the people often attribute</v>

6
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 2>far too much to parental upbringing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a fair amount of data,</v>

7
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from my field that not widely known,</v>

8
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.540
<v Speaker 2>that suggests that the effect of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of parents in shaping intellect and</v>

9
00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 2>personality might even be overrated when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see this in children of immigrants,</v>

10
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 2>even if their parents never acquired the</v>
<v Speaker 2>language and culture of the adopted</v>

11
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:52.750
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as the kids were immersed in a</v>

12
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.100
<v Speaker 2>peer group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ended up as fully competent</v>

13
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 2>citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something indeed that happened to my own</v>

14
00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the children of immigrants who are</v>

15
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 2>culturally utterly inept to never</v>
<v Speaker 2>managed to,</v>

16
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak the language.</v>

17
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 2>And the case of my grandmother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

18
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:10.660
<v Speaker 2>we're constantly at sea and figuring out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the culture.</v>

19
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 2>And my father grew up highly successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you would ask the question of him,</v>

20
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:17.730
<v Speaker 2>how did your parents shape you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would have laughed.</v>

21
00:01:17.731 --> 00:01:21.000
<v Speaker 2>He shaped himself a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to deny credit to my</v>

22
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:25.710
<v Speaker 2>parents who brought me up in a rich and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulating a household,</v>

23
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 2>but I think I'd be kind of inventing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>novelistic autobiography,</v>

24
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 2>which is I think what most people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When asked,</v>

25
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Speaker 2>how did your parents influence you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That having been said,</v>

26
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a house with,</v>

27
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 2>with books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with discussion,</v>

28
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 2>with arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with people coming in,</v>

29
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

30
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging us with interesting ideas so</v>

31
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:53.391
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have traded it for anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the scientist in me says that warns</v>

32
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 2>against my own tendency to tell a story</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how it explained who I am today.</v>

33
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.470
<v Speaker 2>It's natural to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to credit who you are with your parents.</v>

34
00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 2>It seems like an act of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of decency or gratitude.</v>

35
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I often have to apologize to my parents</v>

36
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do appreciate everything that</v>

37
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 2>you did to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that the scientific data lead</v>

38
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 2>me to think that parents don't shape</v>
<v Speaker 2>children as much as most people think.</v>

39
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Speaker 2>And their attitude is I should give them</v>
<v Speaker 2>credit for their attitude,</v>

40
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 2>which is we would want you to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything but what you believe based on</v>

41
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:30.300
<v Speaker 2>the best scientific evidence that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

42
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:33.580
<v Speaker 2>that you take seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So don't try to fashion your answer to</v>

43
00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:35.390
<v Speaker 2>have to flatter us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

44
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.723
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

45
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.050
<v Speaker 2>is a sign of the kind of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

46
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think as interested in ideas and in</v>

47
00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 2>providing good reasons for your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

48
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:49.200
<v Speaker 2>as I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether I inherited that,</v>

49
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 2>whether they fostered in me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

50
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they deserve a full credit for that even</v>

51
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:57.150
<v Speaker 2>if perhaps by the standards of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>

52
00:02:57.151 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 2>I seem to be denying them credit.</v>

53
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 2>And in talking about theories of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaping of personality,</v>

54
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.340
<v Speaker 2>I think the only way to make sense of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature and nurture is person.</v>

55
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Most obviously to point out that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not alternatives that I,</v>

56
00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:20.370
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't have nurture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the creation and transmission of</v>

57
00:03:20.371 --> 00:03:25.371
<v Speaker 2>culture without a rich system of emotion</v>
<v Speaker 2>and learning to make sense of it.</v>

58
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.670
<v Speaker 2>To create the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to acquire the culture.</v>

59
00:03:29.671 --> 00:03:31.740
<v Speaker 2>If you're faced with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning it as a child,</v>

60
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the other direction,</v>

61
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.050
<v Speaker 2>it would be a pretty useless kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>innate human nature if it couldn't take</v>

62
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.350
<v Speaker 2>in information from the environment if</v>
<v Speaker 2>it couldn't figure out the kind of</v>

63
00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:48.351
<v Speaker 2>physical and social world that had been</v>
<v Speaker 2>placed in a and soaked up information as</v>

64
00:03:50.281 --> 00:03:51.500
<v Speaker 2>to how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

65
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.300
<v Speaker 2>to prosper in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to.</v>

66
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.270
<v Speaker 2>So you need both a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they interact?</v>

67
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened.</v>

68
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.210
<v Speaker 2>You have to specify,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

69
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.300
<v Speaker 2>the innate motivational systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the innate learning mechanisms that make</v>

70
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.940
<v Speaker 2>learning and transmission of culture</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

71
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.400
<v Speaker 2>So something is an eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

72
00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:16.401
<v Speaker 2>Eight is not concrete behaviors or</v>
<v Speaker 2>chunks of knowledge.</v>

73
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.130
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight is an ability to analyze the world</v>

74
00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:23.970
<v Speaker 2>and to learn in certain ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Language makes it a concrete.</v>

75
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.850
<v Speaker 2>We could not possibly be born with</v>
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>

76
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.010
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just an ability to learn generically</v>

77
00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:34.890
<v Speaker 2>isn't enough because you can take a baby</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could take a,</v>

78
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.490
<v Speaker 2>a cat or a parrot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give them the same environment.</v>

79
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.920
<v Speaker 2>The baby will learn to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cat won't.</v>

80
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so something in neat must be there as</v>

81
00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:45.810
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the case of language,</v>

82
00:04:45.811 --> 00:04:50.811
<v Speaker 2>it would be a motive and an ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>analyze the signals coming out of</v>

83
00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:57.171
<v Speaker 2>someone else's mouth as being formed out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of units that have fixed meanings within</v>

84
00:04:57.841 --> 00:05:02.841
<v Speaker 2>a community and competent tutorial rules</v>
<v Speaker 2>that allow new ideas to be expressed by</v>

85
00:05:04.711 --> 00:05:09.060
<v Speaker 2>arranging these fixed signals in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in different orders and combinations.</v>

86
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.440
<v Speaker 2>The brain mechanism that is equipped to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>

87
00:05:13.441 --> 00:05:16.470
<v Speaker 2>to find the words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nouns,</v>

88
00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:20.910
<v Speaker 2>the verbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the phrases to analyze speech as having</v>

89
00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:23.580
<v Speaker 2>that logic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's an eight,</v>

90
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.570
<v Speaker 2>a not just a generic ability to learn at</v>
<v Speaker 2>one extreme,</v>

91
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.120
<v Speaker 2>not knowledge of English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the other extreme.</v>
