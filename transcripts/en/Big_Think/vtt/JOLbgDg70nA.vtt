1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I finished up a celebrity apprentice.</v>

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I finished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:08.070
<v Speaker 1>I came home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.293
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>a book of my reading list that was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Kahneman's book thinking fast and</v>

6
00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:17.870
<v Speaker 1>slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opened it up and started reading and</v>

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.030
<v Speaker 1>realized I was reading kind of two</v>
<v Speaker 1>things at once.</v>

8
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>An explanation of what I gone through on</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrity apprentice and the best magic</v>

9
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>book I ever read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the annual condom and knew</v>

10
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>he was riding a magic book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he knew he was running</v>

11
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:33.060
<v Speaker 1>about celebrity apprentice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he might have,</v>

12
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>when I was on celebrity apprentice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would see people who I knew fairly</v>

13
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:39.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.480
<v Speaker 1>and I would see them acting in ways that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a wrong for their personalities,</v>

15
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:50.430
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:51.620
<v Speaker 1>I found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

17
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing at times and I couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out why when you're outside of</v>

18
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

19
00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>they must be giving them a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol,</v>

20
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:04.800
<v Speaker 1>which alcohol is always available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people in my team didn't drink.</v>

21
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.390
<v Speaker 1>So that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you're telling people that</v>

22
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 1>crazy because it'll make better TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't happening either.</v>

23
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>No one ever talked to me about that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I read,</v>

24
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>and this is not economists work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was quoting someone else.</v>

25
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 1>He just kind of brought it together for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

26
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>He talked about a ego depletion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ego exhaustion,</v>

27
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out that if you just put</v>
<v Speaker 1>cameras on someone like you're doing to</v>

28
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:33.561
<v Speaker 1>me here and you asked them to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will speak a little clearer,</v>

29
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>a little better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little more carefully than they would</v>

30
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>if there were no cameras around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that only works up to a point and we</v>

31
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>tend to think of or I always tended to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about a new data about anybody</v>

32
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always tended to think of some</v>

33
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.820
<v Speaker 1>willpower as a character trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom would talk about,</v>

34
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pen,</v>

35
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:55.770
<v Speaker 1>you have to have willpower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>willpower,</v>

36
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>

37
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Self control was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important to my family,</v>

38
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>very important and I thought of as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>character trait.</v>

39
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>This is something that maybe I'm born</v>
<v Speaker 1>with some of it,</v>

40
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.860
<v Speaker 1>but I also want to develop and the mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>blowing thing about thinking fast and</v>

41
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:15.360
<v Speaker 1>slow reading that book was that it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a character trait.</v>

42
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.410
<v Speaker 1>It is not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

43
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.470
<v Speaker 1>a quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

44
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a muscle,</v>

45
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.190
<v Speaker 1>the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sensor that the,</v>

46
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thoughtful part of us that controls</v>

47
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the self control is something that</v>

48
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:37.050
<v Speaker 1>requires effort and a lot of effort and</v>
<v Speaker 1>after you've used that for awhile,</v>

49
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>if they may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you make someone very,</v>

50
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>very careful about what they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four hours,</v>

51
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>they walk by a piece of chocolate cake</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're on a diet,</v>

52
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:50.350
<v Speaker 1>they'll still eat the chocolate cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was on celebrity apprentice with</v>

53
00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:53.820
<v Speaker 1>the camera's on me all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully watching my move,</v>

54
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.050
<v Speaker 1>I did not make any attempt to eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy cheeseburger,</v>

55
00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>French fries every single lunch.</v>

56
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>I just don't have the energy to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself control that way.</v>

57
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when my ego breaks down,</v>

58
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>when selfcontrol goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually get very quiet.</v>

59
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>What I tend to do is shut up and if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched celebrity apprentice,</v>

60
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 1>as the day goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a less provocative.</v>

61
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I am less confrontational when I am well</v>
<v Speaker 1>rested and working and full of self</v>

62
00:03:32.091 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am very aggressive.</v>

63
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>It's what I do for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I get tired,</v>

64
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I get quieter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have conflicts with people.</v>

65
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>I have to push,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>to be an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

67
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>other people who were very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very nice and was images were very nice.</v>

68
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

69
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.383
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

70
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>they're a public image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very pleasant and sweet.</v>

71
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>After these cameras were on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>for a five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six hours,</v>

73
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.820
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden that what I'm calling a</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle,</v>

74
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.420
<v Speaker 1>that selfcontrol would just be exhausted</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would just spew out anything</v>

75
00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 1>was popping into their heads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really angry,</v>

76
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>squabbling and yelling and pressure.</v>

77
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>And it was a fascinating way to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

78
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.630
<v Speaker 1>And it never crossed my mind that what</v>
<v Speaker 1>was happening was not some sort of</v>

79
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:27.700
<v Speaker 1>mental illness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but simply a kind of,</v>

80
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.310
<v Speaker 1>lack of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 1>selfcontrol caused simply by this ego</v>
<v Speaker 1>exhaustion,</v>

83
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.430
<v Speaker 1>which is very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that well,</v>

84
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.140
<v Speaker 1>the way I understood condiments book or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the section of the book is,</v>

85
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>is not that they were physically tired</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even mentally tired,</v>

86
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>but that self control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ego part was tired.</v>

87
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.480
<v Speaker 1>That part that says you will kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do this,</v>

88
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 1>but you should probably do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

89
00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.370
<v Speaker 1>it was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

90
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I did when I read the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Kahneman book was I bought copies</v>

91
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:06.240
<v Speaker 1>for all the producers on celebrity</v>
<v Speaker 1>apprentice and send it to him.</v>

92
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.521
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

93
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:07.750
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you're doing.</v>

94
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very funny that condom and</v>

95
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 1>talks about all these studies that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been done where they put people in a</v>

96
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:20.551
<v Speaker 1>room with TV cameras and had them do</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasks to watch how they acted and said,</v>

97
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could have just saved a lot of</v>

98
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could have just turned on the</v>

99
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:28.090
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost every show is a reality show and</v>

100
00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:30.090
<v Speaker 1>they're all based on that technique</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

101
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>that kind of Anti Hawthorne effect that</v>
<v Speaker 1>after your watched for a little while,</v>

102
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Speaker 1>you do better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it all falls apart.</v>
