1
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.700
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed me most about our political</v>

2
00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:12.701
<v Speaker 1>system in the last decade or so has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>the incredible partisanship.</v>

3
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.400
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting about issues and having</v>

4
00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:19.220
<v Speaker 1>different views about them and arguing</v>
<v Speaker 1>vigorously for that point of view,</v>

5
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.760
<v Speaker 1>but opposing a point of view simply</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's the point of view of the</v>

6
00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:24.080
<v Speaker 1>other party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Speaker 1>That's bad.</v>

8
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.860
<v Speaker 2>We hold these truths to be self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All men are created equal.</v>

9
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.010
<v Speaker 2>I think you're going down by their</v>
<v Speaker 2>creator,</v>

10
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.800
<v Speaker 2>certain money</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaving their America and they have a</v>

11
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:47.154
<v Speaker 2>lot of money.</v>

12
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.330
<v Speaker 3>That was on my values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moral values.</v>

13
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.000
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to do anything but look</v>
<v Speaker 3>right there and so yeah,</v>

14
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:56.950
<v Speaker 3>for tomorrow's have dropped in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

15
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 3>dewey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can actually see Russia from land</v>

16
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 3>here in Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot go to a seven 11 or a Dunkin</v>

17
00:01:17.981 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Speaker 3>donuts unless you have a slight Indian</v>
<v Speaker 3>accent.</v>

18
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.680
<v Speaker 1>We're headed towards 2030 years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible chaos and turmoil.</v>

19
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.393
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.910
<v Speaker 3>On Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the economy,</v>

21
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:40.100
<v Speaker 3>on healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a global warming.</v>

22
00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:43.280
<v Speaker 3>There's no real issue where the parties</v>
<v Speaker 3>are grieving and the distinctions are</v>

23
00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:44.114
<v Speaker 3>huge.</v>

24
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.270
<v Speaker 2>These are the people that are connected</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Barack Obama</v>

25
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.760
<v Speaker 3>needs to return to Illinois and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Senate and get some experience and get</v>

26
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:11.060
<v Speaker 3>out and live in the real world for a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>years and get out of that elitist</v>

27
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:15.110
<v Speaker 3>conclave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They called Barack Obama and elitist and</v>

28
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 3>they pretended to Republicans on their</v>
<v Speaker 3>assigned sending mckeen.</v>

29
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.290
<v Speaker 3>Her heart warming story when she was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid is she helped her dad pick out a</v>

30
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.660
<v Speaker 3>several hundred thousand dollars</v>
<v Speaker 3>fountain in front of their mansion.</v>

31
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.950
<v Speaker 3>John Mccain spurned one establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but ended up ironically embracing the</v>

32
00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:33.140
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the cultural conservatives.</v>

33
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:36.260
<v Speaker 3>No question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the Republican Party understands</v>

34
00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:38.570
<v Speaker 3>better what's in the Bible than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Democratic Party.</v>

35
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.170
<v Speaker 3>They demonstrate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Metro.</v>

36
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.610
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason to kill an unborn</v>

37
00:02:42.611 --> 00:02:44.140
<v Speaker 3>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God wouldn't want that.</v>

38
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.100
<v Speaker 3>Republicans wouldn't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Democrats want that.</v>

39
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like it is</v>

40
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.890
<v Speaker 3>John Mccain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's a real guy.</v>

41
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.300
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's had a real life.</v>

42
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 3>Don't think he eats a ruble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I seen him do hot dogs and hamburgers.</v>

43
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 3>This is the Huffington Post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always as loud.</v>

44
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 3>This is a chocolate smoothie buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Healthy chocolate got so I know any raw,</v>

45
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 3>organic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair trade,</v>

46
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:17.251
<v Speaker 3>Cacao powder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that's happening out in the</v>

47
00:03:17.271 --> 00:03:20.060
<v Speaker 3>world today is happening because there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sense of it's us against them.</v>

48
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.660
<v Speaker 3>This sense of other myths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys under our tech and you're</v>

49
00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:25.730
<v Speaker 3>responding with kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work.</v>

50
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were in the heat of a battle to win</v>

51
00:03:27.471 --> 00:03:29.000
<v Speaker 3>this race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A bubble.</v>

52
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.760
<v Speaker 3>Obama needs a sword and a shield.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Shield,</v>

53
00:03:31.761 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 3>which is secondary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to fend off with vigor and strength</v>

54
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.810
<v Speaker 3>the attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the most important thing is the sore</v>

55
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.060
<v Speaker 3>stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up,</v>

56
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.253
<v Speaker 3>stand up.</v>

57
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Merck is based on ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have enough intelligence.</v>

58
00:04:05.391 --> 00:04:08.990
<v Speaker 1>No to remove radical poverty in all</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the world.</v>

59
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Or the trick for the future is to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to recreate what used to be called</v>

60
00:04:12.931 --> 00:04:15.480
<v Speaker 1>the vital center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One question that I think it's always</v>

61
00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:19.290
<v Speaker 1>useful to ask is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I am so sure I'm right,</v>

62
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.960
<v Speaker 1>how come she social?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's right too.</v>

63
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.480
<v Speaker 1>There's always the possibility to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

64
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.470
<v Speaker 2>Good</v>

65
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.140
<v Speaker 1>big part of democracy is being the</v>
<v Speaker 1>leader yourself.</v>
