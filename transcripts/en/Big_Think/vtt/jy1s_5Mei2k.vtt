1
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.190
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely been a lot of talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2
00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:19.060
<v Speaker 1>of the young Brooklyn writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's now been the backlash</v>

3
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.740
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got called the Brooklyn Writer,</v>

5
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not too long ago,</v>

6
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.050
<v Speaker 1>and I was torn between a sense of pride</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a sense of embarrassment because now</v>

7
00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:33.730
<v Speaker 1>it's become such a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.760
<v Speaker 1>I think we again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to think of why that phenomenon</v>

9
00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:37.594
<v Speaker 1>exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

10
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn was initially a cheap</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood for writers to live and you</v>

11
00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:44.140
<v Speaker 1>could have space and you could probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most importantly,</v>

12
00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:45.910
<v Speaker 1>you'd have your own office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

13
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.090
<v Speaker 1>which is what I have now in my current</v>
<v Speaker 1>place in Brooklyn.</v>

14
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:52.660
<v Speaker 1>I have a nice office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have been able to get that in</v>

15
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan at the modest price and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying.</v>

16
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.200
<v Speaker 1>So there's those considerations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

17
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.140
<v Speaker 1>you get enough artists and writers</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving to neighborhood,</v>

19
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.711
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

20
00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:08.710
<v Speaker 1>the thing begins to brand itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.300
<v Speaker 1>probably originating in a sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pride,</v>

22
00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:13.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

23
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.261
<v Speaker 1>People saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:14.891
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:17.140
<v Speaker 1>we're Brooklyn Writers and this is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and,</v>

26
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to defend themselves and then it</v>

27
00:01:20.111 --> 00:01:22.870
<v Speaker 1>becomes a sort of embarrassing brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

28
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.850
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

29
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.120
<v Speaker 1>there's times you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to sort of say it with a smile,</v>

30
00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:29.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're a Brooklyn writer,</v>

31
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.780
<v Speaker 1>but that's probably going to change</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Brooklyn is getting awfully</v>

33
00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:39.670
<v Speaker 1>expensive to the point where it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely in competition with</v>

34
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.500
<v Speaker 1>especially the savory parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

36
00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:45.191
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know.</v>

37
00:01:45.191 --> 00:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I wonder in a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we going to have the,</v>

38
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.400
<v Speaker 1>the queen's writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 1>and then far into the future when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Staten Island writer,</v>

40
00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's scary.</v>

41
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I don't like about it is that</v>

42
00:01:58.421 --> 00:02:03.400
<v Speaker 1>it takes so much attention from all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>writers that don't even live in New</v>

43
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.740
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing about the book tour</v>

44
00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>that was so interesting to me and about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the friendships that I've forged with</v>

45
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.060
<v Speaker 1>the writers who live all over this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

46
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.870
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

47
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I always thought that as a</v>

48
00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:16.900
<v Speaker 1>writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need it to live here,</v>

49
00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:17.511
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

50
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:19.960
<v Speaker 1>and even recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it's a good idea to be near my</v>

51
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.370
<v Speaker 1>editor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my agent,</v>

52
00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:22.390
<v Speaker 1>or to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:24.430
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a fallacy.</v>

54
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

55
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:30.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the feeling that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like spreading the,</v>

56
00:02:30.941 --> 00:02:35.830
<v Speaker 1>the sort of idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that writers need to live,</v>

57
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.490
<v Speaker 1>if not in the Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then right by it.</v>

58
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the beauty is now you can,</v>

59
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.520
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live everywhere anywhere you want.</v>

60
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

61
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do love Brooklyn and I like,</v>

62
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.520
<v Speaker 1>and I like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my new neighborhood and Kensington,</v>

63
00:02:54.521 --> 00:02:57.070
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a very vibrant Middle Eastern</v>

64
00:02:57.071 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>community there that I can spy on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fun.</v>

65
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get a great diversity in</v>

66
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>and it is affordable and it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a formula.</v>
