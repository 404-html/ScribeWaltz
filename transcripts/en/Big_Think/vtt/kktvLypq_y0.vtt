1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.613
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the day is coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soon when we'll look back at that,</v>

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 2>people who believe in God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a silly age.</v>

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although some of us look like,</v>

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it that way now.</v>

7
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but clearly the numbers are,</v>

8
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not in the majority yet,</v>

9
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 2>but the fastest growing group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 2>best growing religious group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so called is the nuns.</v>

11
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.490
<v Speaker 2>The Ano.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people check the box for no</v>

12
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:29.580
<v Speaker 2>religious affiliation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're not necessarily atheists or</v>

13
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 2>agnostics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skeptics,</v>

14
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 2>but they are not affiliated with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

15
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 2>And so on one level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what somebody believes as</v>

16
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 2>long as they leave me alone and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't interfere with my rights,</v>

17
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:44.130
<v Speaker 2>they don't try to kill me and bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

18
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.881
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

19
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:47.820
<v Speaker 2>the JW is the Jehovah witnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They come to my door once in a while.</v>

20
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 2>The Mormons come to my door once in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>while,</v>

21
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 2>it kind of amusing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I invite them in and give him a copy of</v>

22
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 2>skeptic magazine and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

23
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.740
<v Speaker 2>we better call the the head guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come down here.</v>

24
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 2>That's relatively harmless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

25
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.280
<v Speaker 2>but clearly we see with Islam and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that problem of Islamic terrorism,</v>

26
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion has to be reformed.</v>

27
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:11.080
<v Speaker 2>It absolutely does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't worry about the Janes or,</v>

28
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Jews or most Christians,</v>

29
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>causing societal problems anymore</v>

30
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:17.900
<v Speaker 2>because they've gone through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reformation.</v>

31
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 2>Enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the age of reason,</v>

32
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 2>the scientific revolution that came out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other side,</v>

33
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 2>mostly nonviolent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

34
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

35
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.100
<v Speaker 2>Islam hasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

36
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be a reform Islam and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then start to wean people off belief in</v>

37
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:34.050
<v Speaker 2>the supernatural altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do it by Fiat,</v>

38
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.590
<v Speaker 2>but we can inculcate into people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

39
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Speaker 2>critical thinking about everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including God,</v>

40
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.140
<v Speaker 2>throw God into the mix.</v>

41
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 2>That's just another supernatural belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what those of us who work in</v>

42
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:48.990
<v Speaker 2>this area are trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

43
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:50.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the different strategies,</v>

44
00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 2>you can be aggressive about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Richard Dawkins and hitch,</v>

45
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

46
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.350
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty anti anti theist that</v>
<v Speaker 2>works in some cases,</v>

47
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 2>but not other cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other areas.</v>

48
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 2>People need to be reeled in slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gently,</v>

49
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

50
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:05.604
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

51
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.690
<v Speaker 2>that's just a sort of a marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sales and marketing problem.</v>

52
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.520
<v Speaker 2>You know how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

53
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.840
<v Speaker 2>how should we sell our product best?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We call it this.</v>

54
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 2>We use the red logo or the blue logo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of product,</v>

55
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:21.390
<v Speaker 2>test those things and see what works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we all share this overall goal in a</v>

56
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Speaker 2>century or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's possible.</v>

57
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 2>No one will believe in God anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost no one.</v>

58
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that will be good for society.</v>
