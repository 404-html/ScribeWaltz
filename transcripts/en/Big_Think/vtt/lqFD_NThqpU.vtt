1
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.300
<v Speaker 1>In the sense that everyone understands</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is and there's no one who's</v>

2
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:17.760
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been touched in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A mother,</v>

3
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:18.930
<v Speaker 1>a daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sister,</v>

4
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:20.940
<v Speaker 1>a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not starting with,</v>

5
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you what breast cancer is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows about it.</v>

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>It's come out of the closet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no stigma.</v>

7
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>It's very different from what it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Evelyn started.</v>

8
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>And I think everyone wants to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>supportive either because they've had a</v>

9
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>personal experience or almost for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance policy.</v>

10
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>If I do support it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe I won't have that personal</v>

11
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:43.230
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an easy subject to broach with</v>

12
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:46.250
<v Speaker 1>people and people are incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsive.</v>

13
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.563
<v Speaker 2>Mostly</v>

14
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.470
<v Speaker 1>the money that we have raised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have waste in the United States</v>

15
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.720
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have disbursed it internationally.</v>

16
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.520
<v Speaker 1>So we have added on grantees now in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

17
00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:04.750
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Belgium,</v>

18
00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UK,</v>

19
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East and Latin America.</v>

20
00:01:10.481 --> 00:01:12.850
<v Speaker 1>For the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still deriving the bulk of our</v>

21
00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:14.860
<v Speaker 1>money in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.710
<v Speaker 1>though we've had some wonderful help</v>
<v Speaker 1>from companies and,</v>

23
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>and estee lauder up in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.570
<v Speaker 1>and some programs in the UK for the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>

25
00:01:22.571 --> 00:01:27.571
<v Speaker 1>the money has been derived here because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tax incentives for philanthropy that</v>

26
00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.430
<v Speaker 1>existed in u s don't exist elsewhere.</v>

27
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.820
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

28
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of money is,</v>

29
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.200
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has at the very best stayed flat.</v>

30
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.540
<v Speaker 1>And if you factor in inflation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's decreased.</v>

31
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.070
<v Speaker 1>The whole NCI budget for cancer is 5</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion,</v>

32
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.310
<v Speaker 1>which may sound like a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you look at what the tobacco</v>

33
00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:56.110
<v Speaker 1>industry spends about 15 billion</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising cigarettes to teenagers or</v>

34
00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.350
<v Speaker 1>the pet food industry spends about 14</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion advertising pet food.</v>

35
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a small drop in the bucket in all</v>

36
00:02:03.671 --> 00:02:07.240
<v Speaker 1>about 11 billion is spent on cancer</v>
<v Speaker 1>research across the NCI,</v>

37
00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:10.570
<v Speaker 1>the National Cancer Institute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceuticals and private</v>

38
00:02:10.571 --> 00:02:13.300
<v Speaker 1>organizations like the Breast Cancer</v>
<v Speaker 1>Research Foundation.</v>

39
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.890
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a lot of money in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>federal budget has certainly diminished,</v>

40
00:02:17.891 --> 00:02:19.930
<v Speaker 1>if anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

41
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.350
<v Speaker 1>and the pity is that there has never</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a moment in time when knowledge,</v>

42
00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:28.300
<v Speaker 1>scientific knowledge is advancing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a rapid clip.</v>

43
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a hungry animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that if you could feed it,</v>

44
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.400
<v Speaker 1>the answers will come more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Click quickly.</v>

45
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Larry Norton at Memorial Sloan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kettering Cancer Center,</v>

46
00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:40.690
<v Speaker 1>who is our scientific advisor and has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been since the inception of the</v>

47
00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:43.900
<v Speaker 1>foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says truly the only thing that stands</v>

48
00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:45.760
<v Speaker 1>between today and it is money.</v>

49
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Tough question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't what inspires the herb.</v>

50
00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Kent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I knew the answer,</v>

51
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be very smart.</v>

52
00:02:58.731 --> 00:03:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't what inspires the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

53
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>but obviously there have been other</v>
<v Speaker 1>calls on the,</v>

54
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.380
<v Speaker 1>the federal dollar as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

55
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 1>the war and other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one can only hope that under new</v>

56
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>leadership there might be an enrichment</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the federal coffers.</v>

57
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Because right now if you are a</v>
<v Speaker 1>researcher,</v>

58
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>you spent half the year writing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>federal grant and you have only a slim</v>

59
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>percentage of chance that that will get</v>
<v Speaker 1>funded.</v>

60
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Only 8% of approved grants actually get</v>
<v Speaker 1>funded.</v>

61
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 1>And the pity is then there's a brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>drain.</v>

62
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 1>People are actually leaving the field in</v>
<v Speaker 1>droves.</v>

63
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>They get this tremendous education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the vision,</v>

64
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>they have the drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they can't get the dollars to</v>

65
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>move their research forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't pursue what they've been</v>

66
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>trained to do.</v>

67
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>We try to put dollars private dollars in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hands of researchers who have new</v>

68
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>ideas often to help them get the base</v>
<v Speaker 1>data that will make them competitor for</v>

69
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>the limited federal dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a chicken and egg.</v>

70
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>You can't compete for the dollars until</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the data.</v>

71
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>You almost have to finish your research</v>
<v Speaker 1>or know the answer before you can start.</v>

72
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 1>So an organization like ours plays a</v>
<v Speaker 1>critical function,</v>

73
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 1>often teen people up to compete for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>limited dollars and often moving</v>

74
00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:09.650
<v Speaker 1>research forward that might otherwise</v>
<v Speaker 1>language for decades can.</v>

75
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keith was wives</v>

76
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.950
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

77
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.150
<v Speaker 1>my tin cuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And where you and where you contribute?</v>

78
00:04:20.151 --> 00:04:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know we're on the side of the</v>

79
00:04:22.341 --> 00:04:24.020
<v Speaker 1>angels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we're doing good.</v>

80
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.350
<v Speaker 1>I know we're making a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

81
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm not asking for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People always say to me,</v>

82
00:04:29.211 --> 00:04:31.250
<v Speaker 1>what's the key to being a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundraiser?</v>

83
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.720
<v Speaker 1>It's being able to ask in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can say no,</v>

84
00:04:35.721 --> 00:04:40.721
<v Speaker 1>and the doors open for you to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's asking in a collaborative fashion.</v>

85
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so how has our success come about?</v>

86
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.820
<v Speaker 1>We're very attentive to retaining our</v>
<v Speaker 1>donors,</v>

87
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.610
<v Speaker 1>cultivating our donors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stewarding rs owners,</v>

88
00:04:49.611 --> 00:04:54.170
<v Speaker 1>and growing the average gift size and</v>
<v Speaker 1>was equally as [inaudible] in acquiring</v>

89
00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:57.020
<v Speaker 1>new donors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do both and you don't have a</v>

90
00:04:57.021 --> 00:05:01.220
<v Speaker 1>drain at one side and you're new and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you never grow because your new one</v>

91
00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:04.520
<v Speaker 1>simply replace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're very dedicated across the board.</v>

92
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.460
<v Speaker 1>I like asking for money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for myself,</v>

93
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.010
<v Speaker 1>but this is for a good cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like doing,</v>

94
00:05:10.011 --> 00:05:11.930
<v Speaker 1>it fires me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Evelyn Lauder,</v>

95
00:05:11.931 --> 00:05:14.240
<v Speaker 1>who is the founder and chairman of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation,</v>

96
00:05:14.241 --> 00:05:17.690
<v Speaker 1>is as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as dog in and dedicated as I am.</v>

97
00:05:17.691 --> 00:05:20.840
<v Speaker 1>She's also smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciative,</v>

98
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.860
<v Speaker 1>and a wonderful colleague.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very motivational when you work</v>

99
00:05:24.861 --> 00:05:28.550
<v Speaker 1>for somebody whose heart and soul into</v>
<v Speaker 1>this with you and a partner,</v>

100
00:05:28.551 --> 00:05:31.740
<v Speaker 1>a true partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we do it together with zeal and with</v>

101
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.750
<v Speaker 1>success in your job.</v>
