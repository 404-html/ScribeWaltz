1
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.250
<v Speaker 1>The first part of your question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live streaming is we defined it in first</v>

2
00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:15.620
<v Speaker 1>implemented it back in the mid 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>

3
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a time based versus space are</v>

4
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:22.010
<v Speaker 1>surface based organization of</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

5
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.420
<v Speaker 1>The idea was that every electronic</v>
<v Speaker 1>assets you had,</v>

6
00:00:26.421 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 1>every piece of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was an email or an instant</v>

7
00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:32.720
<v Speaker 1>message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was a file or a spreadsheet,</v>

8
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:37.400
<v Speaker 1>whether it was a photo or an MP3,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would appear in a single time ordered</v>

9
00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>stream that mirrored the evolution of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

10
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.870
<v Speaker 1>So in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing on the stream would be</v>

11
00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:47.540
<v Speaker 1>my birth certificate and an electronic</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of that.</v>

12
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>My parents would put my records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>school records,</v>

13
00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>health records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever went on that child onto the</v>

14
00:00:52.821 --> 00:00:56.690
<v Speaker 1>stream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Stream is um,</v>

15
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>continues to flow forward through time.</v>

16
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>I can deal with the future is available</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me as well as the past.</v>

17
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.730
<v Speaker 1>So I can search in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find what I want.</v>

18
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Everything is fully indexed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.640
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

20
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.980
<v Speaker 1>when I schedule things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I know things are coming up,</v>

21
00:01:12.981 --> 00:01:16.460
<v Speaker 1>I put them in the future when I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I need to return to that</v>

22
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:18.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put it in the future.</v>

23
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.440
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.130
<v Speaker 1>and together with that we had an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interface,</v>

25
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.830
<v Speaker 1>we thought it was important not to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>use only of the surface of the screen,</v>

26
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.240
<v Speaker 1>but to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>present displays in depth that made use</v>

27
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:35.030
<v Speaker 1>of the other virtual depth of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>

28
00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:39.500
<v Speaker 1>So I wasn't looking at surface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was more looking through a window into</v>

29
00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:42.050
<v Speaker 1>an arbitrarily large information</v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape.</v>

30
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.710
<v Speaker 1>So instead of the mouse just moving a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cursor over the surface,</v>

31
00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:50.690
<v Speaker 1>it would be a robot vehicle moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>through three space or some arbitrary</v>

32
00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.460
<v Speaker 1>but the basic idea was symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a chronological timeline,</v>

34
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.650
<v Speaker 1>heterogeneous with absolutely everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

35
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.300
<v Speaker 1>We have seen it a commercialized in two</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>

36
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.290
<v Speaker 1>One way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that I'm allowed to talk about</v>

37
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.700
<v Speaker 1>that I no longer own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These patents,</v>

38
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>the patents have changed hands and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>patents are now subject of enormous</v>

39
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.370
<v Speaker 1>lawsuit against Apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not mine because I don't own</v>

40
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.380
<v Speaker 1>the patent I'm told is the largest</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawsuit in patent history.</v>

41
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Apple took these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in a position to say they stole</v>

42
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:27.080
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they did or not legally,</v>

43
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.620
<v Speaker 1>but these ideas are the basis of apples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cover flow of the way they display,</v>

44
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>originally.</v>

45
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:36.351 --> 00:02:41.351
<v Speaker 1>songs on itunes cover flow is now become</v>
<v Speaker 1>a standard way of displaying files on</v>

47
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:44.660
<v Speaker 1>virtually all apple platforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spotlight,</v>

48
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.730
<v Speaker 1>which allows you to find files not by</v>
<v Speaker 1>name or folder,</v>

49
00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:54.560
<v Speaker 1>but by content and time machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a series of,</v>

50
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>of archive things without commenting on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legal aspects which are not capable</v>

51
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.753
<v Speaker 1>of doing.</v>

52
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are live streams.</v>

53
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.130
<v Speaker 1>And there are other companies that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>done similar things that makes me angry</v>

54
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the money,</v>

55
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:15.660
<v Speaker 1>but because of the deliberate failure to</v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge work that,</v>

56
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>that we would have made freely available</v>
<v Speaker 1>as academics.</v>

57
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>companies nowadays will not acknowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's so much money involved.</v>

59
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>The same time on the network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are thousands of groups that are,</v>

60
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>that are building live streams or live</v>
<v Speaker 1>streaming it for themselves in their own</v>

61
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We love to see this activity.</v>

62
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>There's a lifestyle blog talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different life.</v>

63
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

64
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for that matter we're delighted to</v>

65
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 1>see apple do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

66
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>but when there are large companies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>work on it,</v>

67
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>which is also the case with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with friend feed,</v>

68
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

69
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.990
<v Speaker 1>with the event stream on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.630
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 1>which is true with the aol aol Bebo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stream,</v>

72
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 1>which they actually call a live stream</v>
<v Speaker 1>or live streaming.</v>

73
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as if we want to stop that</v>

74
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 1>activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut it down,</v>

75
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>but we'd like to see credit where credit</v>
<v Speaker 1>is due,</v>

76
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>not just to me or even me mainly to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to the graduate student actually</v>

77
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>built the software,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked tremendously hard,</v>

78
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>published the papers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them in,</v>

79
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made them available.</v>

80
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to see credit.</v>
