00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I have a chapter on reasonable doubt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about,</v>

2
00:00:10.071 --> 00:00:15.071
<v Speaker 1>of course the phrase reasonable doubt</v>
<v Speaker 1>covers up in courts of law where juries</v>

3
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.910
<v Speaker 1>are told that they must convict somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>of murder only if there is,</v>

4
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.990
<v Speaker 1>it's beyond reasonable doubt that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are guilty.</v>

5
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.220
<v Speaker 1>And that sounds all very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be beyond reasonable doubt.</v>

6
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.780
<v Speaker 1>But when you think about the fact that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about courtroom dramas which are</v>

7
00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:37.781
<v Speaker 1>so popular on television for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I suspect that this accurately</v>

8
00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:41.680
<v Speaker 1>portray something like what goes on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>real courtrooms.</v>

9
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.990
<v Speaker 1>And I've certainly been on three juries</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

10
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.040
<v Speaker 1>There is a note of suspense in the court</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the jury comes back,</v>

11
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.440
<v Speaker 1>which way will it go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will it be guilty or not guilty?</v>

12
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>And then if they say not guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.590
<v Speaker 1>certain people have a great sign of</v>
<v Speaker 1>relief if they say guilty,</v>

14
00:00:57.591 --> 00:00:58.424
<v Speaker 1>other people do.</v>

15
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.740
<v Speaker 1>So there is a lot of doubt in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>courtroom among people who've sat</v>

16
00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:06.260
<v Speaker 1>through the entire trial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The judge,</v>

17
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lawyers,</v>

18
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:10.970
<v Speaker 1>the audience sat through the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>trial as the jewelry has.</v>

19
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.920
<v Speaker 1>So if the jury comes in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>brings in a verdict that is beyond</v>

20
00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:20.810
<v Speaker 1>reasonable doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody in the code should know that.</v>

21
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 1>If it's beyond reasonable doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there can be no doubt of which way the</v>

22
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:25.640
<v Speaker 1>jewelry we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.450
<v Speaker 1>we'll jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet when the jewelry do give their</v>

24
00:01:29.451 --> 00:01:30.284
<v Speaker 1>verdict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

25
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.060
<v Speaker 1>how can that be if it's beyond</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable doubt?</v>

26
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the following experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suppose that you had two juries</v>

27
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.280
<v Speaker 1>listening to the same evidence and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>two juries not allowed to talk to each</v>

28
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:48.230
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are sent off into separate jury</v>

29
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:51.590
<v Speaker 1>rooms and they come up with their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>separate verdicts.</v>

30
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Who would bet on the jury's coming back</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the same verdict every single time.</v>

31
00:01:56.961 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 1>But actually nobody would in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about the Oj Simpson trial</v>

32
00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:02.150
<v Speaker 1>or for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any 40,</v>

33
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:04.340
<v Speaker 1>based on another jury coming up with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same verdict,</v>

34
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet,</v>

35
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.140
<v Speaker 1>unless you can bet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you can say yes,</v>

36
00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:10.610
<v Speaker 1>they would come up with the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>verdict.</v>

37
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>You cannot really take the phrase beyond</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable doubt.</v>

38
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

39
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not suggesting that we should have</v>
<v Speaker 1>two juries in every trial.</v>

40
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm just pointing out that the phrase</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond reasonable doubt,</v>

41
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.070
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't actually mean what it says.</v>
