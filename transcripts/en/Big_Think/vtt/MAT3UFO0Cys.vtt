1
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.390
<v Speaker 2>When I graduated from Trinity College in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Law,</v>

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.200
<v Speaker 2>I was fortunate enough to go to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard law school at a particularly</v>

4
00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:18.520
<v Speaker 2>interesting time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the class of 68 so I was there in</v>

5
00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:23.521
<v Speaker 2>1967 and 68 and that was a time when</v>
<v Speaker 2>young Americans are questioning the war</v>

6
00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:26.530
<v Speaker 2>in Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were interested in civil rights</v>

7
00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:29.560
<v Speaker 2>programs in the south than Martin Luther</v>
<v Speaker 2>King was assassinated.</v>

8
00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:34.561
<v Speaker 2>That here and Robert Kennedy just after</v>
<v Speaker 2>I graduated and I came back to Ireland,</v>

9
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.620
<v Speaker 2>imbued with that sense that young people</v>
<v Speaker 2>can make a difference.</v>

10
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.120
<v Speaker 2>And I was elected to the Irish Senate</v>
<v Speaker 2>very shortly afterwards and the first</v>

11
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.100
<v Speaker 2>measure bill in the parliament that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced to the age of 25 was a bill</v>

12
00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:51.970
<v Speaker 2>to legalize family planning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seemed to me to be very simple</v>

13
00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:56.971
<v Speaker 2>because married women were not allowed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have the contraceptive pill unless</v>

14
00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:01.960
<v Speaker 2>they had cycle regulation problems and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must have been the weather.</v>

15
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.130
<v Speaker 2>But there was a phenomenon of many</v>
<v Speaker 2>married women having cycle regulation</v>

16
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:11.131
<v Speaker 2>problems and also you couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy or sell the pill.</v>

17
00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:14.200
<v Speaker 2>It was a criminal offense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you could manage to get a pill,</v>

18
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.741
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

19
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.780
<v Speaker 2>the condom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could use a condom,</v>

20
00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:19.780
<v Speaker 2>but not by herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I felt this is something that just</v>

21
00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:24.100
<v Speaker 2>needs to be straightened out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I completely underestimated the</v>

22
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.130
<v Speaker 2>grave offense and a concern that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>caused to a whole range of people.</v>

23
00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 2>I was denounced by bishops and priests</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the pulpit,</v>

24
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.830
<v Speaker 2>and I was denounced by newspapers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was an outcast for awhile,</v>

25
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 2>and it was a very troubling experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of wobbled because I'd been used</v>

26
00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Speaker 2>to being more or less reasonably admired</v>
<v Speaker 2>and liked.</v>

27
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.780
<v Speaker 2>I was doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and suddenly I was actually a heat</v>

28
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:53.080
<v Speaker 2>figure and got hate mail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very good for me because I</v>

29
00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:57.250
<v Speaker 2>learned a lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a few really believe that something</v>

30
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 2>is important and it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then stick to it.</v>

31
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.780
<v Speaker 2>Go through with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay the price,</v>

32
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.570
<v Speaker 2>be unpopular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't be arrogant,</v>

33
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.210
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes you have to stick to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>principles.</v>
