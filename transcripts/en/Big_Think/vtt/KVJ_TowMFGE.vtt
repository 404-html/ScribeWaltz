1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Information over consumption is what a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people think.</v>

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.680
<v Speaker 1>They mean when they say information</v>
<v Speaker 1>overload.</v>

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.820
<v Speaker 1>And that information over consumption</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes a lot more sense,</v>

4
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't say that someone's suffering</v>

5
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>from food overload.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fried chickens are offing themselves</v>

7
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:21.750
<v Speaker 1>than jumping into deep fryer fryers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some undead Zombie chicken flies out of</v>

8
00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>the deep fryer and into our mouths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>for us to eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never that hasn't happened to my</v>

10
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it does,</v>

11
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>well then we're in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken apocalypse.</v>

12
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I laugh at my own jokes,</v>

13
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.250
<v Speaker 1>but information over consumption is</v>
<v Speaker 1>really the right frame for us to,</v>

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>to look at things through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to take responsibility both for</v>

15
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>the supply and the demand of information</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our role as a,</v>

16
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>as a consumer and a supplier of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

17
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>In the world of food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

18
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>we have industrialized agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.490
<v Speaker 1>And as we industrialize agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we created large corporations who have a</v>

20
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>fiduciary responsibility to produce</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap and popular calories.</v>

21
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.190
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

22
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>what is it that people want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now we've made it so that you can</v>

23
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>have a pizza with everything on it</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivered to your house for $15 and a</v>

24
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 1>half hour made from all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things from all kinds of</v>

25
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 1>different places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is as much of a feat of science and</v>

26
00:01:25.321 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>my mind is putting a man on the moon if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really sort of think about what it</v>

27
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>takes in order to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the same thing has gone on</v>

28
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>with information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've industrialized media are media</v>

29
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>companies now have a fiduciary</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to produce cheap and</v>

30
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:42.330
<v Speaker 1>popular information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's led us down the road of Glenn</v>

31
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Beck and Sarah Pailin and Keith</v>
<v Speaker 1>Olbermann and,</v>

32
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.430
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rachel maddow who don't really want to</v>

33
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 1>inform us.</v>

34
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>They want to affirm us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to tell us what it is that we</v>

35
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>think about this for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who wants to hear the truth when they</v>

37
00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>can hear that they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly don't.</v>

38
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>I love being affirmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love being told that I'm right and I</v>

39
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:04.890
<v Speaker 1>certainly like that a lot more than I</v>
<v Speaker 1>like being informed.</v>

40
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a important to</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize when we talk about this supply</v>

41
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>and demand problem of blaming the victim</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we're wired for what was good</v>

42
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>for us and not necessarily what is good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us and our producers are producing</v>

43
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>what was good for us but not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is good for us.</v>

44
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to blame the victim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do want us to start waking up and</v>

45
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>realizing that this has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to have a conscious level of</v>

46
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>consumption when it comes to information</v>
<v Speaker 1>and take your information.</v>

47
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Diet is an ethical choice of yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're on the Huffington post</v>

48
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the Kardashians and you click on the</v>

49
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Kardashians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>understand that you are not only reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>that article,</v>

51
00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:50.610
<v Speaker 1>but you're also voting for that article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're telling an editor to produce more</v>

52
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>content like that at the expense of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that you didn't click on.</v>

53
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>And so we have this sort of rapid</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation of the tyranny of majority,</v>

54
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of that,</v>

55
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>because we are constantly being given</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that we want,</v>

56
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.210
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily what it is that we need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's vital to understand that</v>

57
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference between those two</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

58
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>But in the world of food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

59
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>if we were only given what we want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will we look like?</v>

60
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>We'd be what we'd look like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like what we do today,</v>

61
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>which we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're about 35% of Americans are obese.</v>

62
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>And I think the same thing's going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>with information.</v>

63
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't want people to come to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really focus on consuming less.</v>

64
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

65
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>I think appropriate nutrition shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be focused on consuming less.</v>

66
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be about consuming well and</v>

67
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>being healthy about your information</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption.</v>

68
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.401
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I'd like to see us go.</v>

70
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'd like to see us do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>start building healthy frameworks for</v>

71
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 1>information consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that means reducing it.</v>

72
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that means increasing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that means subtracting some of</v>

73
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 1>the bad stuff and adding some of it gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

74
00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
