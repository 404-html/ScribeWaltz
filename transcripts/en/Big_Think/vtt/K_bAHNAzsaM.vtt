1
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about a particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>provocative set of experience that</v>

2
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.830
<v Speaker 1>meredith chippers has done is this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating Canadian researcher I've</v>

3
00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:20.171
<v Speaker 1>spent so much time with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so several years ago when I first got</v>

4
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:23.870
<v Speaker 1>interested in her work and I kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stumbled into her lab.</v>

5
00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:28.871
<v Speaker 1>I was working on a different unrelated</v>
<v Speaker 1>project at the time when I stumbled into</v>

6
00:00:29.741 --> 00:00:33.770
<v Speaker 1>her lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've found her showing an array of</v>

7
00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 1>pornography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so men with women,</v>

8
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>women with women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men alone,</v>

9
00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:43.511
<v Speaker 1>women alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even bonobos having sex to self</v>

10
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>identified straight women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay women,</v>

11
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.510
<v Speaker 1>straight men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay men,</v>

12
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.810
<v Speaker 1>and measuring both their physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>response that is vaginal or response in</v>

13
00:00:55.791 --> 00:01:00.791
<v Speaker 1>terms of erection for men and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're subjective response via keypad.</v>

14
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.430
<v Speaker 1>How turned on do I say I am?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finding something fascinating which</v>

15
00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>was that wears male response was pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable.</v>

16
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.620
<v Speaker 1>The straight men actually did mostly</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get turned on to men with women or</v>

17
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:19.880
<v Speaker 1>women with women.</v>

18
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Gay Men equally predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The women were very unpredictable and</v>

19
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.140
<v Speaker 1>kind of anarchic in at least their</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical response.</v>

20
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.320
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this big dichotomy.</v>

21
00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:36.770
<v Speaker 1>The women were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm turned on by what I quote should be</v>

22
00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:41.771
<v Speaker 1>turned on by straight women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by men with women or to a certain</v>

23
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:46.430
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose men with men and gay women by</v>

24
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.230
<v Speaker 1>images of women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

25
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>but their bodies were saying something</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different and their bodies</v>

26
00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:56.261
<v Speaker 1>were saying they were turned on by all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it and perhaps most strikingly you</v>

27
00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:02.540
<v Speaker 1>might think those bonobos having sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least you know,</v>

28
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.720
<v Speaker 1>reach something animalistic in men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know the men showed zero response</v>

29
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.830
<v Speaker 1>subjectively or physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the women did show this physical</v>

30
00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:16.190
<v Speaker 1>response to the image of Bonobos having</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex.</v>

31
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:18.560
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of interesting things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

32
00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:23.561
<v Speaker 1>probably too many to name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one for sure is that the idea of</v>

33
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:28.721
<v Speaker 1>women's sexuality as somehow more</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled needs to be put aside.</v>

34
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.240
<v Speaker 1>If we're going to do any serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>searching about arrows and women and to</v>

35
00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:37.100
<v Speaker 1>this idea that women are somehow less</v>
<v Speaker 1>than visual,</v>

36
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:39.770
<v Speaker 1>less immediate in their sexuality than</v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

37
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to put that aside.</v>

38
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:45.980
<v Speaker 1>If we're going to do any serious looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at truths about women's sexuality,</v>

39
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.850
<v Speaker 1>now here's a bit of later shivers</v>
<v Speaker 1>research that both goes along with but</v>

40
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:58.811
<v Speaker 1>also pulls us in a slightly different</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction than that original set of</v>

41
00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 1>studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So remember,</v>

42
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 1>part of the original set of studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows women being quite a narcotic and</v>

43
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>what they're drawn to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She Evers decides,</v>

44
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me take a set of straight women self</v>

45
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>declared straight women and show them</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for types of photographs and see</v>

46
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>what happens for types of pornographic</v>
<v Speaker 1>photographs.</v>

47
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.820
<v Speaker 1>So we've got a full lasted and these are</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of December bodied,</v>

48
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>a genital shots just so we have nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to distract us.</v>

49
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Not a pretty phased out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a handsome face,</v>

50
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've got a dangling flacid penis.</v>

51
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>We've got an erect penis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to kind of coy,</v>

52
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:42.580
<v Speaker 1>soft porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>female crotch shot legs together.</v>

53
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>And then we've got a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs spread,</v>

54
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>more hardcore shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the straight women do respond to all</v>

55
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:55.321
<v Speaker 1>of it physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that erect penis sends the</v>

56
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 1>plethysmograph the measure of physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

57
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just an indication,</v>

58
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:09.810
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of</v>

59
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.640
<v Speaker 1>rawness immediacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just,</v>

60
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of this is about sex.</v>

61
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Let's be careful before we complicate it</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all the factors that we habitually</v>

62
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 1>complicate female sexuality with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a core to this and we shouldn't</v>

63
00:04:36.831 --> 00:04:38.810
<v Speaker 1>be so quick to look away from it.</v>

64
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.590
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
