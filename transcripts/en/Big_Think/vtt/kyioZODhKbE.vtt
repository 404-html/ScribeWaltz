1
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.190
<v Speaker 1>So most of us think that information is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best way to convince people of our</v>

2
00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:15.191
<v Speaker 1>truth and in fact it doesn't work that</v>
<v Speaker 1>well and we see that all the time,</v>

3
00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see it where with climate change,</v>

4
00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:22.040
<v Speaker 1>where there's tons of data suggesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>that climate change is manmade,</v>

5
00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:26.420
<v Speaker 1>but about 50 percent of the population</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't believe it or with people</v>

6
00:00:26.421 --> 00:00:29.690
<v Speaker 1>arguing about things like how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were in the neck in the</v>

7
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:32.750
<v Speaker 1>presidential inauguration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have facts,</v>

8
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.360
<v Speaker 1>but people decide which facts they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to listen to,</v>

9
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:38.810
<v Speaker 1>which facts they want to take and change</v>
<v Speaker 1>their opinions in which they want to</v>

10
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>disregard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons for this is when</v>

11
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:47.840
<v Speaker 1>something doesn't confirm to what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>already believe,</v>

12
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>what people tend to do is either</v>
<v Speaker 1>disregard it or rationalize it away</v>

13
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.340
<v Speaker 1>because information doesn't take into</v>
<v Speaker 1>account what makes us human,</v>

14
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:00.080
<v Speaker 1>which is our emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our desires,</v>

15
00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:01.880
<v Speaker 1>our motives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our prior beliefs.</v>

16
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.020
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one study my colleagues and I tried</v>

17
00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:09.260
<v Speaker 1>to see whether we could use science to</v>
<v Speaker 1>change people's opinions about climate</v>

18
00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:12.230
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing we did was ask people,</v>

19
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.360
<v Speaker 1>do you believe in manmade climate</v>
<v Speaker 1>change?</v>

20
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Do you support the Paris agreement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And based on their answers,</v>

21
00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:20.990
<v Speaker 1>we divided them into the strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>believers and the weak believers.</v>

22
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.140
<v Speaker 1>And then we gave them information for</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people.</v>

23
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:29.141
<v Speaker 1>We said that scientists have reevaluated</v>
<v Speaker 1>the data and now conclude the things are</v>

24
00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:33.590
<v Speaker 1>actually much worse than they thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>before that the temperature would rise</v>

25
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:36.920
<v Speaker 1>by about seven degrees to 10 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some people,</v>

26
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:41.420
<v Speaker 1>we said the scientists have reevaluated</v>
<v Speaker 1>data and they now believe that actually</v>

27
00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:43.400
<v Speaker 1>the situation is not as bad as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

28
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much better and the rise in</v>

29
00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:51.011
<v Speaker 1>temperature would be quite small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we found is that people who did</v>

30
00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:53.900
<v Speaker 1>not believe in climate change when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard that the scientists are saying,</v>

31
00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>actually it's not that bad.</v>

32
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they changed their beliefs even more in</v>

33
00:01:57.981 --> 00:02:00.260
<v Speaker 1>that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they became more extremists in that</v>

34
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:01.460
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when they hear that,</v>

35
00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:03.830
<v Speaker 1>the scientists think it's much worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't nudge.</v>

36
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.930
<v Speaker 1>And the people who already believe that</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change is manmade.</v>

37
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.600
<v Speaker 1>When they heard that things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

38
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:10.700
<v Speaker 1>scientists are saying are much worse</v>
<v Speaker 1>than they did before.</v>

39
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.150
<v Speaker 1>They moved more in that direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they became more polarized,</v>

40
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 1>but when they heard that the scientists</v>
<v Speaker 1>are saying it's not that bad.</v>

41
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:20.390
<v Speaker 1>They didn't touch much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we gave people information and as a</v>

42
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:25.391
<v Speaker 1>result it caused polarization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't cause people to come together.</v>

43
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.100
<v Speaker 1>So the question is what's happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside our brain that causes this?</v>

44
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.690
<v Speaker 1>And in one study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my colleagues and I scanned brain</v>

45
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:39.560
<v Speaker 1>activity of two people who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting and what we found was when</v>

46
00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:42.920
<v Speaker 1>those two people agreed on a question</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we gave them,</v>

47
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.780
<v Speaker 1>the brain was really encoding what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other person was saying,</v>

48
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.250
<v Speaker 1>the details that they gave.</v>

49
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.350
<v Speaker 1>But when the two people disagreed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looked metaphorically as if the brain</v>

50
00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:58.040
<v Speaker 1>was switching off and not encoding what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other person was saying.</v>

51
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>And as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the two agreed,</v>

52
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>they became even more confident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when they disagreed,</v>

53
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't as much of a change in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their confidence in their own view.</v>

54
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>What has been shown by [inaudible] and</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues from Yale University is that</v>

55
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>the more intelligent you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely you are in fact,</v>

56
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 1>to change data at will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they did is they first gave</v>

57
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>participants in their experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm analytical,</v>

58
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:30.001
<v Speaker 1>a math questions to solve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they gave them data about gun</v>

59
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is gun control actually reducing</v>

60
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they found that more intelligent</v>

61
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:41.701
<v Speaker 1>people actually were more likely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>twist data at will to make it conform to</v>

62
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 1>what they already believed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems that people are using their</v>

63
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily to find the truth,</v>

64
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.550
<v Speaker 1>but to take in the information and</v>
<v Speaker 1>change it to conform to what they</v>

65
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:55.000
<v Speaker 1>already believe.</v>

66
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that suggests that just giving people</v>

68
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.750
<v Speaker 1>information without considering first</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're coming from may backfire</v>

69
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:05.070
<v Speaker 1>at us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

70
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.830
<v Speaker 1>but we don't always need to go against</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's conviction in order to change</v>

71
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>their behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let me give you an example for this</v>

72
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 1>is a study that was conducted at Ucla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

73
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.100
<v Speaker 1>were what they wanted to do is convince</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents to vaccinate their kids.</v>

74
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 1>And some of the parents didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>vaccinate their kids because they were</v>

75
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:29.650
<v Speaker 1>afraid of the link with autism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had two approaches.</v>

76
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>First they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

77
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>the link with autism is actually not</v>
<v Speaker 1>meal.</v>

78
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Here's all the data suggesting there</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't a link between vaccines and</v>

79
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 1>autism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it didn't really work that well,</v>

80
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 1>but instead they use another approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of going that way,</v>

81
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>they used another approach which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not talk about autism.</v>

82
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.200
<v Speaker 1>We don't necessarily need to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>autism to convince you to vaccinate your</v>

83
00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead they said,</v>

84
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.480
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these vaccines protect kids from deadly</v>

85
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 1>diseases right from the measles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they showed them pictures of what</v>

86
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:02.110
<v Speaker 1>the measles are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because in this argument about vaccines,</v>

87
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 1>people actually forgot what the vaccines</v>
<v Speaker 1>are for,</v>

88
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.190
<v Speaker 1>what are they protecting us from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they highlighted that and didn't</v>

89
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.280
<v Speaker 1>necessarily go on to discuss autism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that had a much better outcome for</v>

90
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.380
<v Speaker 1>the parents were much more likely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

91
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.990
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are going to vaccinate our kids.</v>

92
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.490
<v Speaker 1>So the lesson here is that we need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find the common motives.</v>

93
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.790
<v Speaker 1>The common motives in this case was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>health of the children,</v>

94
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily going back to the the</v>

95
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.910
<v Speaker 1>thing that they were arguing about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they disagreed about.</v>
