<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are lots of things that</v>

2
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.170
<v Speaker 1>that can be taught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the ultimate that it's a very good</v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.260
<v Speaker 1>what is true is that in the world of</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

7
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.450
<v Speaker 1>fairly quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people find themselves in a leadership</v>

8
00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:30.920
<v Speaker 1>position in the sense that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for a group or they're</v>

9
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:33.950
<v Speaker 1>responsible for a team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for,</v>

10

11
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:44.111
<v Speaker 1>path to achieve some common objectives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are techniques that you can</v>
