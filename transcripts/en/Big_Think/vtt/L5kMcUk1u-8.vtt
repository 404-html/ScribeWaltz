1
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.501
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2
00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:09.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in a class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3
00:00:09.941 --> 00:00:10.571
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:10.571 --> 00:00:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I hate to always sound like a middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road or I don't believe in a clash</v>

5
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.030
<v Speaker 1>of civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the other thing that's a helpful</v>

6
00:00:16.031 --> 00:00:17.170
<v Speaker 1>way to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Muslim people or a Muslim people</v>

8
00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>around the world are probably like</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else around the world.</v>

9
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:24.830
<v Speaker 1>And people are more or less the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They care about their children.</v>

10
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.110
<v Speaker 1>They care about the opportunities they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

11
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:28.910
<v Speaker 1>They care about freedom and self</v>
<v Speaker 1>expression.</v>

12
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>And when they feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not their worldview is,</v>

14
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.010
<v Speaker 1>is right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.671
<v Speaker 1>on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:37.010
<v Speaker 1>when they feel dictated to are</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannized,</v>

17
00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:40.550
<v Speaker 1>even if it's the tyranny of a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's the tyranny of Mickey</v>

18
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.791
<v Speaker 1>Mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:42.380
<v Speaker 1>invading their homes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:43.161
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:43.821
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

22
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:45.380
<v Speaker 1>they're going to stand in opposition.</v>

23
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.300
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a sizable number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslims,</v>

24
00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Speaker 1>and by no means a majority who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who feel threatened by the,</v>

26
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.680
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by America's place in the world and by</v>

27
00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:58.550
<v Speaker 1>the export of American culture and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>militarization of their region.</v>

28
00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.121
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.000
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think that makes it a</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization class.</v>

30
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Cause then that implies that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle to the death and you can never</v>

31
00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:05.720
<v Speaker 1>win people over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we know that's not true.</v>

32
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:07.850
<v Speaker 1>And I think history tells us that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

33
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.871
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

34
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:11.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people make decisions that are best for</v>

35
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.390
<v Speaker 1>them and best for their children and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their families and their economic</v>

36
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing and their safety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

37
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.180
<v Speaker 1>and if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

38
00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:17.990
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>

39
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll change their minds and their</v>

40
00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:21.450
<v Speaker 1>worldviews according to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.020
<v Speaker 1>but do I think that it's all overblown?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that in fact,</v>

42
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:25.660
<v Speaker 1>there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:27.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>army of radical Islam that in fact,</v>

44
00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:29.510
<v Speaker 1>September 11th was just an isolated</v>
<v Speaker 1>incident.</v>

45
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.700
<v Speaker 1>And as somebody has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one Democrat recently told me,</v>

46
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:33.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'd,</v>

47
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.590
<v Speaker 1>if you'd gone to sleep on September</v>
<v Speaker 1>10th,</v>

48
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.341
<v Speaker 1>2001 and woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:39.260
<v Speaker 1>last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd think that we'd had 12 cities</v>

50
00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:40.940
<v Speaker 1>destroy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've completely overreacted.</v>

51
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

52
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.930
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a serious defining threat</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this moment.</v>

53
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I think there are people trying to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

54
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.800
<v Speaker 1>I think there are many people trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill us.</v>

55
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this is the red scare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

56
00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:54.440
<v Speaker 1>the John Birch Society and Bob Dylan</v>
<v Speaker 1>singing about looking under his toilet</v>

57
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:55.760
<v Speaker 1>for communism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is,</v>

58
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.630
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a and an and a relatively organized and</v>

59
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.420
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous group of people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can and probably will get access to</v>

60
00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:08.450
<v Speaker 1>the worst kind of weaponry we know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we didn't,</v>

61
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.050
<v Speaker 1>if we didn't take that seriously as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy priority,</v>

62
00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:13.640
<v Speaker 1>I think we would not be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:15.920
<v Speaker 1>we would not be fulfilling our</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to the world.</v>
