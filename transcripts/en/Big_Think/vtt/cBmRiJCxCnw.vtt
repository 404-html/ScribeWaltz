1
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.020
<v Speaker 1>In terms of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the skill of executing stories,</v>

2
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.100
<v Speaker 1>I would say we're getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.080
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:22.780
<v Speaker 1>I think clearly when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

5
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:27.220
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned the series damages and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that was just an article in the New</v>

6
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.090
<v Speaker 1>York magazine the other day about</v>
<v Speaker 1>damages and they brilliant way in which</v>

7
00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:34.480
<v Speaker 1>that that series does something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.720
<v Speaker 1>that really never been explored quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way before.</v>

9
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>They use flash forwards as hooks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give you glimpses of the future,</v>

10
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.950
<v Speaker 1>but only glimpses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that they put you in a state of</v>

11
00:00:47.951 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>semi dramatic irony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

12
00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:54.070
<v Speaker 1>more than the character knows the</v>
<v Speaker 1>character is going to die.</v>

13
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that this character is going to</v>

14
00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:57.010
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you go,</v>

15
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.410
<v Speaker 1>you flash forward to their death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right?</v>

16
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.570
<v Speaker 1>And now you're watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go back and you're watching them in</v>

17
00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:02.560
<v Speaker 1>the present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know what?</v>

18
00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:03.100
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know.</v>

19
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.950
<v Speaker 1>You know that he's going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know how and why he's</v>

20
00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 1>going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

21
00:01:08.621 --> 00:01:10.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't know who did it,</v>

22
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.780
<v Speaker 1>who killed him and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's lots of hooky questions</v>

23
00:01:13.781 --> 00:01:18.310
<v Speaker 1>and curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a bit of a dramatic irony.</v>

24
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.950
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

25
00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:22.420
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see it,</v>

26
00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:24.490
<v Speaker 1>you wonder why hasn't this been done</v>
<v Speaker 1>before?</v>

27
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in terms of executing stories,</v>

28
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.560
<v Speaker 1>I would say that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>that the techniques are better than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than ever in terms of the content of the</v>

30
00:01:35.021 --> 00:01:37.300
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another question.</v>

31
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.540
<v Speaker 1>And in terms of what these stories are</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

32
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>what they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the depth to which they,</v>

33
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.400
<v Speaker 1>they bring their characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

34
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I would say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're where it's the stories are more</v>

35
00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:52.990
<v Speaker 1>shallow overall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge generalization.</v>

36
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.170
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and postmodernism itself,</v>

37
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>by definition mean shadowing us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means a satire of the techniques or</v>

38
00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:03.430
<v Speaker 1>writing okay.</v>

39
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Calling attention to the techniques of</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>

40
00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:11.080
<v Speaker 1>And that of course divorces you from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>content by the very nature of it.</v>

41
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.860
<v Speaker 1>And so in this post postmodern world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever we are now,</v>

42
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that as a,</v>

43
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>as a grand generalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the content of stories are not the</v>

44
00:02:23.141 --> 00:02:28.141
<v Speaker 1>quality that they were in the 50 golden</v>
<v Speaker 1>years from the 1920s to the 1970s on</v>

45
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.860
<v Speaker 1>stage page and screen everywhere in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

46
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:35.650
<v Speaker 1>especially the English speaking world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the films,</v>

47
00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:39.670
<v Speaker 1>the plays and the novels of that period</v>
<v Speaker 1>were magnificent in content.</v>

48
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.290
<v Speaker 1>And so we've learned to be more clever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more experimental.</v>

49
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.950
<v Speaker 1>And I'm more skilled often in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling of stories today,</v>

50
00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:51.250
<v Speaker 1>but I can't say that the content is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to be.</v>

51
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.380
<v Speaker 1>I never lose faith in story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Film may come and go as an art form and</v>

52
00:03:03.741 --> 00:03:08.741
<v Speaker 1>be art forms have come and gone opera</v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less came and went and then just</v>

53
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>gets revived endlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's very little cutting edge opera</v>

54
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

55
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their art forms that a rise up and</v>

56
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 1>dominate a period of time in human</v>
<v Speaker 1>history and then receipt.</v>

57
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 1>And so it film goes through that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>recedes.</v>

58
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.440
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there will always be story and</v>

59
00:03:30.441 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

60
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the medium of the future I think is</v>

61
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly the novel and the theater</v>

62
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>is still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive and well for the most part,</v>

64
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 1>despite some pretty mediocre</v>
<v Speaker 1>storytelling.</v>

65
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

66
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the art of storytelling,</v>

67
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>the artist's story I never worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will always tell stories and they</v>

68
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>will tell really great stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful stories,</v>

69
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 1>but the medium</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the future,</v>

70
00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.810
<v Speaker 1>the medium that writers choose to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do what is the best work in the</v>

71
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:06.730
<v Speaker 1>future that changes human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A great critic,</v>

72
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>once Kenneth Burke said it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories are equipment for living.</v>

73
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Human beings need storytelling in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sense out of life in order to</v>

74
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 1>live as well and civilized as a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being can.</v>

75
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.350
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will go to the storyteller,</v>

76
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for meaningful emotional experiences</v>

77
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 1>that they can I get from life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it just,</v>

78
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.070
<v Speaker 1>it just a matter of of which medium the</v>
<v Speaker 1>storytellers of the future choose to,</v>

79
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 1>to dominate that period in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's two will change in time.</v>

80
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 1>The time that people spend in stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>created for them by a storytelling</v>

81
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 1>artists today compared to 50 a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

82
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's triple or quadruple what it used to</v>

83
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:55.870
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

84
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.330
<v Speaker 1>do they need it more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could make an argument that</v>

85
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.660
<v Speaker 1>the disintegration and relativization of</v>
<v Speaker 1>values in contemporary society,</v>

86
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.630
<v Speaker 1>society is so blurring that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperately need stories to help them</v>

87
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>make sense out of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what we used to agree upon,</v>

88
00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:20.070
<v Speaker 1>nobody agrees on anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Society is,</v>

89
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is obvious,</v>

90
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:25.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so splintered and so split.</v>

91
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a spectrum.</v>

92
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.760
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a spectrum that runs from,</v>

93
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am my brother's keeper to every man</v>

94
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:40.021
<v Speaker 1>for himself and that on that we call</v>
<v Speaker 1>that liberals and then the right</v>

95
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.480
<v Speaker 1>conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

96
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this argument over are we are our</v>

97
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:51.481
<v Speaker 1>brother's keeper or is it every man for</v>
<v Speaker 1>themself is never been more ugly</v>

98
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.260
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fragmenting of,</v>

99
00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 1>of society.</v>

100
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.030
<v Speaker 1>And so people are clustering now in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

101
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 1>depending upon their position on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that spectrum of caring or not</v>

102
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 1>caring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

103
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 1>in such ways that they cannot even talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people who are anywhere else on that</v>

104
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 1>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a result,</v>

105
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more chaos in daily life and</v>

106
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:22.470
<v Speaker 1>then throw in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

107
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.070
<v Speaker 1>a the great recession and a few other</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos is like wars and,</v>

108
00:06:27.071 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are desperate and they need</v>

109
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:30.651
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

110
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 1>I think you could make an argument now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they getting the quality of stories</v>

111
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>a comic or tragic that would help them</v>
<v Speaker 1>live through this,</v>

112
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 1>this really ugly period in history?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>

113
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the writers do their best because</v>

114
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 1>the writers are just citizens too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.970
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

116
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.020
<v Speaker 1>they've got no necessarily more</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical or psychological insight</v>

117
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.570
<v Speaker 1>into this than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

118
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 1>than anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>

119
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.630
<v Speaker 1>the writer has to be a philosopher of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind today that they've never had to be</v>

120
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:07.970
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to make sense out of a kind of</v>

121
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The no one ever confronted before.</v>

122
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst thing that in,</v>

123
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred years ago or,</v>

124
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.520
<v Speaker 1>and the worst thing that could happen is</v>
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>

125
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] so people told stories about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to live well or live meaningfully if</v>

126
00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:25.430
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the or tragedy,</v>

127
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.211
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:28.190
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but death was the worst thing.</v>

129
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's far worse things now,</v>

130
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.280
<v Speaker 1>far worse things and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

131
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are literally</v>

132
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.350
<v Speaker 1>living health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could they,</v>

133
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 1>they'd be better off dead all around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

134
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.010
<v Speaker 1>The suffering and the third world today</v>
<v Speaker 1>is of an extreme that the third world</v>

135
00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:51.840
<v Speaker 1>has never suffered before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because generally speaking,</v>

136
00:07:51.841 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 1>in the Third World,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people didn't starve to death.</v>

137
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:58.560
<v Speaker 1>They could farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even that in many ways has been</v>

138
00:07:58.561 --> 00:07:59.680
<v Speaker 1>lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

139
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

140
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.570
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

141
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

142
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:05.803
<v Speaker 1>The world is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

143
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.500
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a worse state than I,</v>

144
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.160
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I know from history that people</v>

145
00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:11.530
<v Speaker 1>would probably say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

146
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:16.590
<v Speaker 1>the black plague was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

147
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.210
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

148
00:08:18.211 --> 00:08:22.200
<v Speaker 1>because people understood the plague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get sick and you die.</v>

149
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Who can understand the banking system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can understand love,</v>

150
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.500
<v Speaker 1>who can understand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

151
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:32.423
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parenting.</v>

152
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

153
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things that people thought they</v>

154
00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:37.270
<v Speaker 1>knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know anymore.</v>

155
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.850
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plague at least was clear.</v>

156
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.710
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was clear.</v>

157
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.950
<v Speaker 1>The problem for people today is</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion.</v>

158
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a world that should make sense and</v>

159
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.090
<v Speaker 1>wanting what you have more communication</v>
<v Speaker 1>than ever makes it less and less sense</v>

160
00:08:52.091 --> 00:08:55.090
<v Speaker 1>than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you need storytellers to make</v>

161
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:59.190
<v Speaker 1>sense out of that chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it says that it's a chaos of a very</v>

162
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 1>different kind today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

163
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the writers struggles.</v>

164
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
