1
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I routinely point out that we could</v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminate 80% of all chronic disease by</v>

2
00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:15.460
<v Speaker 1>using what we know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't do that.</v>

3
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.020
<v Speaker 1>We really bogged down in bickering about</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we know what we know and,</v>

4
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.760
<v Speaker 1>and is this part of what we know more</v>
<v Speaker 1>important than that part of what we know</v>

5
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.730
<v Speaker 1>and in no place is that a bigger problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>than diet.</v>

6
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.210
<v Speaker 1>There's obviously a lot of money to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>made from confusion.</v>

7
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some years ago I worked on air for Good</v>

8
00:00:33.461 --> 00:00:38.461
<v Speaker 1>Morning America and I saw firsthand that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there really is invested interest in tv</v>

9
00:00:39.881 --> 00:00:43.090
<v Speaker 1>and the median propagating constant</v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

10
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.940
<v Speaker 1>If you say the same thing about diet on</v>
<v Speaker 1>air,</v>

11
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.570
<v Speaker 1>enough times in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people lose interest in your dietary</v>

12
00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:51.580
<v Speaker 1>segments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you say something different every</v>

13
00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:54.070
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always interesting to an end</v>

14
00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:57.340
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow for a new answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the media are in on it.</v>

15
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>The fad diet authors are in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>basically a lot of people who just think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that their view of the truth through a</v>

17
00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:07.900
<v Speaker 1>particular tunnel is the only truth are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in on it.</v>

18
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>But the result is we squander the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to use what we know because</v>

19
00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:16.750
<v Speaker 1>we bogged down in debate about what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know quite so well.</v>

20
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 1>So having completely lost my patients</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the status quo decided to do</v>

21
00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:24.110
<v Speaker 1>something about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

22
00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:28.720
<v Speaker 1>and it's really challenging now because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a time not all that long ago</v>

23
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 1>when a single voice could rise above the</v>
<v Speaker 1>den.</v>

24
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.890
<v Speaker 1>For example about doctor coop when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was surgeon general or Benjamin spock</v>

25
00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:38.650
<v Speaker 1>and the influence that he had on parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>raising young children.</v>

26
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.420
<v Speaker 1>But that era is gone because we live in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the age of the blogosphere in cyberspace</v>

27
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:48.010
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's got a microphone and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's just this incredible amount</v>

28
00:01:48.011 --> 00:01:48.844
<v Speaker 1>of static.</v>

29
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.850
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of it all the answer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question,</v>

30
00:01:51.851 --> 00:01:56.230
<v Speaker 1>can we say what diet is best for health?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by health we mean longevity,</v>

31
00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:57.550
<v Speaker 1>vitality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight control,</v>

32
00:01:57.551 --> 00:02:02.551
<v Speaker 1>all the good stuff that we all want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is absolutely no.</v>

33
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.300
<v Speaker 1>If what we mean is a very specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescriptive,</v>

34
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.550
<v Speaker 1>my diet can beat your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

35
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we say whether the best</v>

36
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Mediterranean diet is better than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best Vegan Diet?</v>

37
00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Or if that's better than the best Palio</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diet for human health?</v>

38
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.030
<v Speaker 1>The answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If what we mean though by can we say</v>

39
00:02:22.031 --> 00:02:26.140
<v Speaker 1>what diet is best for health is a basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>theme of optimal living.</v>

40
00:02:26.141 --> 00:02:31.141
<v Speaker 1>Then the answer is a categorical yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly clear from incredibly</v>

41
00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:35.140
<v Speaker 1>voluminous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly consistent literature all</v>

42
00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:37.000
<v Speaker 1>around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diverse populations,</v>

43
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:40.330
<v Speaker 1>diverse methods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>observational epidemiology where you</v>

44
00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:44.170
<v Speaker 1>just watch and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intervention trials where you assigned</v>

45
00:02:44.171 --> 00:02:44.860
<v Speaker 1>people to die.</v>

46
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>It's randomized control trials and real</v>
<v Speaker 1>world experience with large populations</v>

47
00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:54.190
<v Speaker 1>like the blue zones and frankly Michael</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul and pretty much nailed this one.</v>

48
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Eat Food not too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly plants that really captures the</v>

49
00:02:58.181 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>essence of all the world's diets that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are associated with good health</v>

50
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I wrote about this with my</v>

51
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>colleague Frank Hugh from Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we said wholesome foods in sensible</v>

52
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 1>combinations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then to put a little meat on the</v>

53
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>bones is it were wholesome foods means</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>

54
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole grains,</v>

55
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>beans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lentils,</v>

56
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeds,</v>

57
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>whether without everything else you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat.</v>

58
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat fish.</v>

59
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.110
<v Speaker 1>You won't eat seafood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd seafood.</v>

60
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>You want to eat some lean meat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to eat eggs?</v>

61
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to eat dairy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do,</v>

62
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>but the bulk of your diet should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>

63
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 1>fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole grains,</v>

64
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:33.911
<v Speaker 1>beans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lentils,</v>

65
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>nuts and seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is true all around the world where</v>

66
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>people do the best.</v>

67
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 1>It's true in the Mediterranean where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>diets or high fat,</v>

68
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>but the fat is coming from nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeds,</v>

69
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>olives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>avocado,</v>

70
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>olive oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true in the Far East where the</v>

71
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 1>diets are low fat because there's lots</v>
<v Speaker 1>of vegetables,</v>

72
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.130
<v Speaker 1>grains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and less of the nuts and the avocado.</v>

73
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.310
<v Speaker 1>And frankly it's true of diets as</v>
<v Speaker 1>diverse as Vegan and Paleo people who</v>

74
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>really know what they're doing with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>palio diet are eating a wide variety of</v>

75
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>preferably wild plants,</v>

76
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>but not necessarily and lean meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>preferably game.</v>

77
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 1>So it's real food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not too much.</v>

78
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>And it is mostly plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a Vegan diet is a slightly wider</v>

79
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 1>variety of plant foods without the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're actually more alike than</v>

80
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:23.950
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there really is incredible clarity</v>

81
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 1>about the fundamentals of healthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating.</v>

82
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.470
<v Speaker 1>And I think really the big issue for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us is focusing our efforts on making</v>

83
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 1>the fundamentals of that.</v>

84
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Dietary pattern more accessible in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and allowing for people to</v>

85
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>choose the variant on that theme that</v>
<v Speaker 1>works best for them.</v>

86
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.550
<v Speaker 1>So you need to eat well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in a world that keeps running on</v>

87
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Dunkin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to eat well and feed your</v>

88
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 1>children well in a world that market's</v>
<v Speaker 1>multicolored marshmallows as part of a</v>

89
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 1>complete breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to be physically active in a</v>

90
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 1>world that gives you no time for</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise and gives you more and more</v>

91
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:01.800
<v Speaker 1>technology to do everything that muscles</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to do.</v>

92
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 1>So the theme of healthy eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably clear,</v>

93
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 1>this specific claims about my diet can</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat your diet,</v>

94
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 1>all false,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all somebody trying to sell you</v>

95
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:14.440
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>step away from your credit card and</v>

96
00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:15.274
<v Speaker 1>nobody will get hurt.</v>

97
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
