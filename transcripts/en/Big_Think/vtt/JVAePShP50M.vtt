00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.450
<v Speaker 1>A code of ethics doesn't solve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be a guide,</v>

2
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.570
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals have to make their own</v>

3
00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:22.720
<v Speaker 1>ethical decisions every time they face a</v>
<v Speaker 1>question in a quandary.</v>

4
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>I've had have had editors who have stood</v>
<v Speaker 1>by me and defended me when I pissed off</v>

5
00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:30.280
<v Speaker 1>somebody in the company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've also have editors who come</v>

6
00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:31.061
<v Speaker 1>after me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

7
00:00:31.061 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that because it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>piss off somebody and no code was going</v>

8
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:40.371
<v Speaker 1>to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that I've learned new ethics in</v>

9
00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:41.530
<v Speaker 1>the blog world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I line,</v>

10
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.680
<v Speaker 1>that's not to say that they're better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not to say that I rejected the</v>

11
00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:46.480
<v Speaker 1>ethics of journalism than I learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

12
00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:47.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I teach them,</v>

13
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.660
<v Speaker 1>but I've learned an ethic of</v>
<v Speaker 1>transparency online and my blog now,</v>

14
00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:54.520
<v Speaker 1>I tell you the stock I owned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I vote for,</v>

15
00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:56.920
<v Speaker 1>and all kinds of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I wouldn't have done back in</v>

16
00:00:56.921 --> 00:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>the days when I was a full time</v>
<v Speaker 1>reporter,</v>

17
00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:00.190
<v Speaker 1>but I think are very important now.</v>

18
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.750
<v Speaker 1>So I've learned an ethic of</v>
<v Speaker 1>transparency.</v>

19
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I've learned a new ethic of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>correction on blogs.</v>

20
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.910
<v Speaker 1>If we make a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't erase it.</v>

21
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.680
<v Speaker 1>We cross it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fess up,</v>

22
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:11.380
<v Speaker 1>we admitted was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we don't do that very quickly,</v>

23
00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:14.950
<v Speaker 1>we're going to lose credibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've learned an ethic of openness and</v>

24
00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:17.200
<v Speaker 1>collaboration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I'm working on a story,</v>

25
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked my readers to help me and they</v>

26
00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:22.720
<v Speaker 1>are very generous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I just ask,</v>

27
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.770
<v Speaker 1>those are new ethics that I've learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>online that I think old media can learn</v>

28
00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:28.180
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

29
00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:31.510
<v Speaker 1>there are ethics of the old world that</v>
<v Speaker 1>live forever,</v>

30
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.610
<v Speaker 1>that are immutable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fairness,</v>

31
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.120
<v Speaker 1>accuracy of balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not objectivity,</v>

32
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.020
<v Speaker 1>but I think those are things that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a better job of helping to teach from</v>

33
00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:42.520
<v Speaker 1>old media for our experience.</v>
