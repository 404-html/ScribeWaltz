00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never really thought of the media was</v>

2
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>some kind of bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something has changed.</v>

3
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean the media now is so diverse and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so complex and there's so much of it,</v>

4
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can find problems with</v>

5
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.440
<v Speaker 1>anything I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact of the matter is a lot of</v>

6
00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:29.270
<v Speaker 1>media today isn't targeted to me a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason to target with any person in</v>

7
00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:31.580
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look for certain market segments</v>

8
00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:34.250
<v Speaker 1>and they go for them and they really</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't care anything about anybody else</v>

9
00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:37.060
<v Speaker 1>or what anybody else thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

10
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professionally I was part of that</v>

11
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>process for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do believe today if you're an</v>

12
00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:43.340
<v Speaker 1>active,</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>

13
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.230
<v Speaker 1>educated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughtful person,</v>

14
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.680
<v Speaker 1>you can find a mix of media that appeals</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>

15
00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:53.540
<v Speaker 1>satisfies you more readily and better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than any point in time in history.</v>

16
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.430
<v Speaker 1>So you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

17
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:57.500
<v Speaker 1>the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so exploitative.</v>

18
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>They lean towards a sensational thing or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have enough international</v>

19
00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:04.760
<v Speaker 1>news coverage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

20
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.740
<v Speaker 1>it's your decision what you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

21
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>And there's just so many other options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really have a hard time feeling sorry</v>

22
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:11.690
<v Speaker 1>for anybody who has that point of view.</v>
