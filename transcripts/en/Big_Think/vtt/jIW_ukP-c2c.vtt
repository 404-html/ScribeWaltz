1
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that,</v>

2
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.290
<v Speaker 1>the question of what's uniquely humans</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually a big one.</v>

3
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

4
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.490
<v Speaker 1>depending on who you ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might get really different answers.</v>

5
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.760
<v Speaker 1>If I had to put my money on something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was actually uniquely human,</v>

6
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.560
<v Speaker 1>it seems in some funny way to be our</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation to actually interact with</v>

7
00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:29.290
<v Speaker 1>others in a funny way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I mean by this is that,</v>

8
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.960
<v Speaker 1>generally if you look at any humans</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere,</v>

10
00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>if they're hanging out with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>

11
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.160
<v Speaker 1>they're often doing something where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're showing something to another</v>

12
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.380
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see something cool,</v>

13
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.730
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh hey,</v>

14
00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:43.210
<v Speaker 1>look at this cool thing and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist this is this process of</v>

15
00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:43.871
<v Speaker 1>reference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

16
00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Sort of share referring to information</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there in a world.</v>

17
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.540
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like other primates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you think this is kind of a</v>

18
00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:51.460
<v Speaker 1>simple ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem to lack at least the</v>

19
00:00:51.461 --> 00:00:53.420
<v Speaker 1>motivation to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.920
<v Speaker 1>this leads to the fact that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the kind of communication that we</v>

21
00:00:56.921 --> 00:01:00.160
<v Speaker 1>have your things like language with now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it can kind of point to things</v>

22
00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the world.</v>

23
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also don't seem to share their own</v>

24
00:01:03.671 --> 00:01:07.960
<v Speaker 1>desires and intentions with others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which leads to a lack of kind of</v>

25
00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>cooperation and a lot of domains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

26
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.460
<v Speaker 1>so if I had to put my money on what was</v>
<v Speaker 1>uniquely human,</v>

27
00:01:12.461 --> 00:01:14.410
<v Speaker 1>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go with a kind of motivation to</v>

28
00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:16.030
<v Speaker 1>share information with others.</v>
