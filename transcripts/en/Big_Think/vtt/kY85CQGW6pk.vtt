WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do agree with that.</v>

2
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll leave.</v>

3
00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:10.720
<v Speaker 1>The government should be open.</v>

4
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the worst example was when the</v>

5
00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:17.960
<v Speaker 2>vice president said he wasn't as good as</v>
<v Speaker 2>submit to the scrutiny of Congress when</v>

6
00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:22.610
<v Speaker 2>they asked them for a documents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then outrageously he said that he</v>

7
00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:26.270
<v Speaker 2>was not going to provide them cause he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a member of the executive branch.</v>

8
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.910
<v Speaker 2>And I sat the Ysl well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is he a farmer?</v>

9
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.630
<v Speaker 2>My point is that when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>national security,</v>

10
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.330
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to just simple</v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

11
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.170
<v Speaker 2>I got into a little trouble when I said</v>
<v Speaker 2>at one of the debates that,</v>

13
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Ufos aliens,</v>

14
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the problems that have been</v>

15
00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 2>compounded about propagating this myth</v>
<v Speaker 2>that aliens exist in Roswell,</v>

16
00:00:52.821 --> 00:00:56.690
<v Speaker 2>New Mexico was because the government</v>
<v Speaker 2>has not provided full disclosure of</v>

17
00:00:56.691 --> 00:01:01.430
<v Speaker 2>incidents that happened years ago about</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible landings in Roswell,</v>

18
00:01:01.431 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 2>New Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they just released all the</v>

19
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:06.920
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't have had this problem.</v>

21
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe in general,</v>

22
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.590
<v Speaker 2>government is very secretive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very bureaucratic in many cases.</v>

23
00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 2>It turns people off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very impersonal.</v>

24
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.100
<v Speaker 2>And one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the objectives I would have is to</v>

25
00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:22.940
<v Speaker 2>make the government more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more friendly to people,</v>

26
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 2>more responsive to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do that by leading by example.</v>

27
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.960
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

28
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.520
<v Speaker 2>look at everything that needed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>declassified,</v>

29
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:33.980
<v Speaker 2>national security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a domestic,</v>

30
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.650
<v Speaker 2>and I would say this is the first step</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do.</v>

31
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>secondly,</v>

32
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 2>I would also say to the American people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

33
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you access to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

34
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.440
<v Speaker 2>I think the president is assemble a of</v>
<v Speaker 2>American government and leadership.</v>

35
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.920
<v Speaker 2>What I would do is I'd submit to</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfettered town meetings with the</v>

36
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:55.160
<v Speaker 2>American people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have office hours where ordinary</v>

37
00:01:55.161 --> 00:01:59.180
<v Speaker 2>people could come to see me as long as</v>
<v Speaker 2>it were five minutes and they didn't</v>

38
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:00.050
<v Speaker 2>carry a weapon.</v>

39
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.660
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done that as governor.</v>

40
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

41
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.050
<v Speaker 2>make the White House more part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>American family,</v>

42
00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:11.300
<v Speaker 2>make it more accessible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

43
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.150
<v Speaker 2>obviously a president has to worry about</v>
<v Speaker 2>security,</v>

44
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.430
<v Speaker 2>but I would spend a night in people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>homes just trying to explain that</v>

45
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.520
<v Speaker 2>government can be on the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>American people.</v>

46
00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:26.360
<v Speaker 2>One of our big problems has been that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American people think that</v>

47
00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:28.280
<v Speaker 2>government is simply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not on their side.</v>

48
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.780
<v Speaker 2>That government is there to block</v>
<v Speaker 2>progress at government is there to make</v>

49
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:34.730
<v Speaker 2>things more difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more bureaucratic.</v>

50
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.910
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is the tone of leadership</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a president would break.</v>

51
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
