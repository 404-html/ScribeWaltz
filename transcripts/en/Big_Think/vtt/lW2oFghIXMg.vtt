00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.840
<v Speaker 1>What keeps them up at night in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive way is the possibility that we</v>

2
00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:17.200
<v Speaker 1>might contribute to the development of</v>
<v Speaker 1>human culture in a way that,</v>

3
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>years from now,</v>

4
00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:24.181
<v Speaker 1>people who will never know our names may</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to live more empowered lives.</v>

5
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.410
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you asked like,</v>

6
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.080
<v Speaker 1>what is the name of your great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

7
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.960
<v Speaker 1>great grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't even know if he got</v>

8
00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:35.080
<v Speaker 1>three or four greats out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that we're mortal,</v>

9
00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:36.940
<v Speaker 1>we're going to dive very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very soon.</v>

10
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not that what we produce is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live on,</v>

11
00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:42.700
<v Speaker 1>it will not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the changes that we can make in the</v>

12
00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:47.170
<v Speaker 1>culture can be there for people we will</v>
<v Speaker 1>never meet.</v>

13
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.410
<v Speaker 1>We'll never know us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what keeps me up at night.</v>

14
00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:53.440
<v Speaker 1>It's what excites me about science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can learn,</v>

15
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways of being with each other.</v>

16
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.460
<v Speaker 1>And the behavioral sciences have not</v>
<v Speaker 1>been enough of a part of cultural</v>

17
00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:03.550
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The physical sciences have behavioral</v>

18
00:01:03.551 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 1>sciences have not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would like to see if we can bring</v>

19
00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:13.030
<v Speaker 1>some things into human culture that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would humanize and soften and empower</v>

20
00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:18.031
<v Speaker 1>people or keeps you up at night in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative way is if we don't solve these</v>

21
00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:23.920
<v Speaker 1>problems of the human heart and of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human head of human psychology,</v>

22
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>there is no technological solutions so</v>
<v Speaker 1>great that it can prevent the world that</v>

23
00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:35.011
<v Speaker 1>is coming in a world of suitcase bombs</v>
<v Speaker 1>or have the ability to pollute the</v>

24
00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:40.360
<v Speaker 1>planet in a way that it cannot recover a</v>
<v Speaker 1>of global warming and the rest we've</v>

25
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:44.950
<v Speaker 1>created through science and technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different world that has frightening</v>

26
00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:49.840
<v Speaker 1>sides to it and psychology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral science has to be part of</v>

27
00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:54.841
<v Speaker 1>this because if you take something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the so called war on terrorism by the,</v>

28
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.540
<v Speaker 1>if we go out another 20 years and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't just planes into buildings,</v>

29
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:04.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's a suitcase bomb in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of New York,</v>

30
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.010
<v Speaker 1>there's not enough soldiers and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not enough bullets to kill enough people</v>

31
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.180
<v Speaker 1>to make us safe.</v>

32
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to have to find a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to humanize the culture itself and</v>

33
00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:19.630
<v Speaker 1>it isn't just them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's us when we fly buildings,</v>

34
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up fly planes,</v>

35
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.460
<v Speaker 1>over countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropping bombs on the evil ones.</v>

36
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.570
<v Speaker 1>I think we're doing something very</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to what's being done when the</v>

37
00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:32.620
<v Speaker 1>infidels are getting their comeuppance</v>
<v Speaker 1>with planes going into buildings.</v>

38
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.670
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gotten to the point where if we are</v>

39
00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:40.600
<v Speaker 1>not healthy psychologically as a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

40
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.850
<v Speaker 1>we will not have a planet to live on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what keeps me up at night</v>

41
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>when I see so little focus on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral side of these problems and</v>

42
00:02:56.201 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>the idea that just politics or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just science is going to solve this</v>

43
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>or just the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>

44
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>We have to solve this and we've got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve it in our own heads and in our own</v>

45
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>hearts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one at a time.</v>

46
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 1>And I think psychotherapy actually tells</v>
<v Speaker 1>us a little bit about what we might need</v>

47
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>to do to soften the culture and make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>more possible for us to live together as</v>

48
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>human beings on this planet.</v>
