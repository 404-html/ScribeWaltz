1
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was born in 1934 and the,</v>

3
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>as you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the depression was on a,</v>

4
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:19.311
<v Speaker 1>I think I am a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can legitimately consider myself a,</v>

5
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.050
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a child of the depression and that,</v>

6
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:24.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody had anything.</v>

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're not used to having</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

8
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>when you do have something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you appreciate it a lot more.</v>

9
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because everybody was in the same</v>

10
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:35.970
<v Speaker 1>boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was also a kind of an affinity of,</v>

11
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 1>of misery and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:40.260
<v Speaker 1>and as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no mystery.</v>

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everybody's suffering the same way,</v>

14
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a kind of,</v>

15
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 1>we're all in this together and I felt</v>
<v Speaker 1>that with my,</v>

16
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a kid and I'm a.</v>

17
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:53.810
<v Speaker 1>and then World War Two came and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.920
<v Speaker 1>we lived in Kansas in Wichita,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kansas where they built the b seventeens</v>

19
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>and the [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mother in fact worked on the assembly</v>

20
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:06.441
<v Speaker 1>line of the b 29 as a wire cutter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Boeing plant in Wichita and a world</v>

21
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:08.030
<v Speaker 1>war two.</v>

22
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>And we thought that the Japanese were</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to bomb us any moment because we</v>

23
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 1>had the Boeing plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was after Pearl Harbor.</v>

24
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it,</v>

25
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.180
<v Speaker 1>what it did for me is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war was,</v>

27
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:25.710
<v Speaker 1>was a very present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it was physically very,</v>

28
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>very far away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very much a part of our lives.</v>

29
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 1>my dad had been a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

31
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.840
<v Speaker 1>a moraine and the 19 twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>I decided right then and there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>someday I would grow up to be a marine</v>

33
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 1>and so did my older brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a matter of fact,</v>

34
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:43.040
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>

35
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff kind of began there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

36
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>that here again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the World War II was similar in,</v>

37
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.111
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the depression and that there was a</v>

39
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:54.470
<v Speaker 1>togetherness about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't a,</v>

40
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't him and her and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

41
00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>And they was all of us at war.</v>

42
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>All of us doing the best we could to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to beat the bad guys and to protect</v>

44
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:07.550
<v Speaker 1>ourselves from the bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

45
00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

46
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

47
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I think frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

48
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 1>I am fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds strange,</v>

49
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.840
<v Speaker 1>but I am fortunate that I did have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and World War II and those</v>

50
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>early years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

53
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>

54
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.740
<v Speaker 1>because of those two experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a day to day experiences in both cases,</v>

55
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>I have never ever been somebody who took</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything for granted because,</v>

56
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.380
<v Speaker 1>because I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was part of my growing up and part of</v>

58
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>my formation is who I am today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

59
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:46.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>it all began with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.380
<v Speaker 1>wondering where we were going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough money to have dinner tonight.</v>

62
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not somebody's next to me or</v>
<v Speaker 1>some member of my family was going to</v>

63
00:02:57.211 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>die in a war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It made everything.</v>

64
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>It heightened everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heightened awareness,</v>

65
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 1>heightened interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heightened intensity of life.</v>

66
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>And I still feel that.</v>
