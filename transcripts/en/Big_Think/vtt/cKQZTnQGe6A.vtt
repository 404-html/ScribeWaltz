1
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Now remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Central Asia was under Soviet rule for</v>

2
00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:15.620
<v Speaker 1>many decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and before that it was part of the</v>

3
00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:20.240
<v Speaker 1>czarist empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an area of many different ethnic</v>

4
00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:21.770
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Uzbeks,</v>

5
00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.960
<v Speaker 1>the Tajiks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kazaks,</v>

6
00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:27.050
<v Speaker 1>the Kyrgies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to some degree,</v>

7
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.970
<v Speaker 1>the territory is that these groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabited would never really clearly</v>

8
00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:35.090
<v Speaker 1>demarcated there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're nomadic people,</v>

9
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.890
<v Speaker 1>so they have traditional lands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Zaras came in and said,</v>

10
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:41.420
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where we're going to draw the</v>

11
00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:43.760
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the Soviets came in and drew</v>

12
00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:48.761
<v Speaker 1>the lines and they don't really bear</v>
<v Speaker 1>close approximation to where the</v>

13
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.450
<v Speaker 1>particular people lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are a lot of competing claims</v>

14
00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:57.680
<v Speaker 1>to wear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their territory should be,</v>

15
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.010
<v Speaker 1>and in these areas lie uranium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lie natural gas and coal and oil.</v>

16
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.500
<v Speaker 1>So there are some struggles underway as</v>
<v Speaker 1>to who should control what of these</v>

17
00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:18.140
<v Speaker 1>valuable areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could have fights in the future</v>

18
00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:21.130
<v Speaker 1>that a territorial over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 1>who should get these prized areas.</v>

20
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Now on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a situation where most of the</v>

21
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 1>governments in these areas are</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled by people who were once part</v>

22
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:37.490
<v Speaker 1>of the Soviet bureaucratic machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

23
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:38.051
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

24
00:01:38.051 --> 00:01:41.900
<v Speaker 1>they look and smell like old sue Soviet</v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucrats.</v>

25
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're,</v>

26
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.040
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:49.700
<v Speaker 1>they claim to be Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're really not.</v>

28
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really very authoritarian.</v>

29
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.330
<v Speaker 1>And with the new wealth coming from oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>and natural gas,</v>

30
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.310
<v Speaker 1>well most of that money winds up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands of their friends and relatives and</v>

31
00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:06.311
<v Speaker 1>cronies and a lot of of the wealth</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappears into hidden bank account</v>

32
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:08.280
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

33
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking particularly of the family</v>

34
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.520
<v Speaker 1>of Nursultan Nazarbayev,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president of Kazakhstan,</v>

35
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:18.860
<v Speaker 1>which is the wealthiest of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

36
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the people in these countries</v>

37
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:26.390
<v Speaker 1>are not getting any wealthier since the</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakup of the Soviet Union.</v>

38
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.650
<v Speaker 1>These are also predominantly Muslim</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

39
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.890
<v Speaker 1>They have been a target of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Muslim Islamic fundamentalist</v>

40
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:42.731
<v Speaker 1>movements of the past decade or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking of groups associated with</v>

41
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:50.441
<v Speaker 1>Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda and some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other extremist movements that we've</v>

42
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:55.721
<v Speaker 1>heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these groups are finding some</v>

43
00:02:56.121 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>sympathy among the people of these areas</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the governments to be corrupt,</v>

44
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>to be insensitive to their needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be pocketing all the money and giving</v>

45
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 1>it to their cronies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the future you could have</v>

46
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>uprisings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the kind,</v>

47
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:18.031
<v Speaker 1>we've had another countries that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fueled by Islamic propaganda,</v>

48
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.750
<v Speaker 1>but really at heart are about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maldistribution of resource wealth.</v>

49
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like what I was talking about in</v>

50
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:33.091
<v Speaker 1>the Niger Delta area where the elites</v>
<v Speaker 1>claim all of the resource wealth</v>

51
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>conditions are deteriorating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the masses of the people are getting</v>

52
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>worse off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not better conditions,</v>

53
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>a deteriorating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is exactly the kind of fertile</v>

54
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:47.910
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere in which extremist movements</v>
<v Speaker 1>take off.</v>

55
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I worry about.</v>

56
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.220
<v Speaker 1>This is an area of geopolitical</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition between three great powers.</v>

57
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 1>This is the one part of the globe in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the United States,</v>

58
00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Russia and China are all competing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence.</v>

59
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:08.320
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>

60
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.410
<v Speaker 1>after the breakup of the Soviet Union</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw this is an area to gain geopolitical</v>

61
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:19.771
<v Speaker 1>advantage and new sources of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first President Clinton and now</v>

62
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:25.201
<v Speaker 1>President Bush have made an all out</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort to gain influence in the stands</v>

63
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:29.020
<v Speaker 1>is they're called Kazakhstan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uzbekistan,</v>

64
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Turkmenistan and Tajikistan Kyrgyzstan</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I get them all right,</v>

65
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.910
<v Speaker 1>but Russia which used to control this</v>
<v Speaker 1>area under the Soviets and before that</v>

66
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 1>the tsars also wants to control this</v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

67
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 1>But now you have a third factor in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

68
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.950
<v Speaker 1>which is very worried about instability</v>
<v Speaker 1>and its back door.</v>

69
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.200
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese region of Shen Jiang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has a Muslim majority area and</v>

70
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:06.631
<v Speaker 1>it's extreme west and it's the one part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of China that's predominantly Muslim.</v>

71
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 1>They are very worried about instability</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this area.</v>

72
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.600
<v Speaker 1>So it wants to have a say in what goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>on in Central Asia and it has growing</v>

73
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 1>economic interests in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also wants to tap into the,</v>

74
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.120
<v Speaker 1>the resource riches of Central Asia has</v>
<v Speaker 1>also become involved.</v>

75
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.670
<v Speaker 1>So you have three great powers all</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking geopolitical influence it once</v>

76
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.820
<v Speaker 1>the United States is providing military</v>
<v Speaker 1>aid,</v>

77
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Russia is providing military aid and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>China has stepped in,</v>

78
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.950
<v Speaker 1>collaborating often with Russia through</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new organization known as the Shanghai</v>

79
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Cooperation Organization or the SCO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Seo pr jointly with,</v>

80
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and Russia together provide</v>

81
00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 1>military aid to the stands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this isn't enough,</v>

82
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 1>both United States and Russia have</v>
<v Speaker 1>established military bases in the</v>

83
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 1>region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely and Kyrgyzstan.</v>

84
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.600
<v Speaker 1>You have about 50 miles apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a US base on one side of Bishkek,</v>

85
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 1>the Capitol of Kyrgyzstan and a Russian</v>
<v Speaker 1>base.</v>

86
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 1>On the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned all of this because you have</v>

87
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:25.751
<v Speaker 1>to imagine a situation in the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's some kind of upheaval and</v>

88
00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Kyrgyzstan between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:35.291
<v Speaker 1>one political faction against the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The military breaks apart and somehow or</v>

90
00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:41.000
<v Speaker 1>another American soldiers and Russian</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers get caught up in the conflict</v>

91
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.893
<v Speaker 1>and overnight</v>

92
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.650
<v Speaker 2>have shooting.</v>
