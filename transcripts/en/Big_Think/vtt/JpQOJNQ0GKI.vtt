1
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.800
<v Speaker 1>All</v>
<v Speaker 1>right</v>

2
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.620
<v Speaker 2>from the age of five onwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was one of the earliest things I</v>

3
00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:21.070
<v Speaker 2>started to read when I started to read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

4
00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:23.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very much part of my</v>

5
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 2>consciousness in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw the Bhagavad Gita is a text that</v>

6
00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 2>was very classical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most like the Iliad and the Odyssey,</v>

7
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 2>a mythical saga that showed the eternal</v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict between good and evil.</v>

8
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.640
<v Speaker 2>But much later as I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized that it was much more than</v>

9
00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:51.430
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It what it was an examination of</v>

10
00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:56.431
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and the desire of human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings or the quest that we have as</v>

11
00:00:57.461 --> 00:01:02.461
<v Speaker 2>human beings to understand ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it was the map you might say,</v>

12
00:01:03.581 --> 00:01:08.581
<v Speaker 2>for exploring the territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that leads us to find out things</v>

13
00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:13.330
<v Speaker 2>about ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who are we?</v>

14
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 2>Where do we come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the meaning and purpose of our</v>

15
00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 2>existence?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

16
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.110
<v Speaker 2>do we have a soul?</v>

17
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.640
<v Speaker 2>What happens to us after we die?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does God Exist?</v>

18
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Does God in fact care about us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can we get in touch with that source</v>

19
00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:38.020
<v Speaker 2>that we call consciousness is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness behind our thoughts.</v>

20
00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:43.021
<v Speaker 2>Also the consciousness responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the intelligent activity of the</v>

21
00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:47.560
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bhagavad Gita is actually a very</v>

22
00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:51.310
<v Speaker 2>good text for Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Yoga of love,</v>

23
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 2>the Yoga of action or Karma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the yoga of understanding or intellect</v>

24
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.280
<v Speaker 2>and the yoga of reflection and</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation.</v>

25
00:02:00.281 --> 00:02:05.281
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's a very important a map</v>
<v Speaker 2>for understanding the nature of</v>

26
00:02:08.381 --> 00:02:12.280
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The word Yoga is the same as the English</v>

27
00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Word York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

28
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.890
<v Speaker 2>so in the New Testament when Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ says,</v>

29
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 2>my yoke is easy and my burden is light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my interpretation is that he's referring</v>

30
00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:27.100
<v Speaker 2>to yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It Means Union,</v>

31
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Speaker 2>Union of the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind and spirit as one continuum of</v>

32
00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:36.050
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the Bhagavad Gita is about,</v>

33
00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:39.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both are the forces of light and the</v>

34
00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:43.930
<v Speaker 2>forces of darkness that exists within</v>
<v Speaker 2>our own self,</v>

35
00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:48.931
<v Speaker 2>within our own soul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our deepest nature is one of</v>

36
00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:50.110
<v Speaker 2>ambiguity.</v>

37
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 2>We have evolutionary forces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their forces of creativity and love and</v>

38
00:02:56.411 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 2>compassion and understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we also have darkness inside us.</v>

39
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 2>The diabolical forces of separation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear and delusion.</v>

40
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 2>And a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in most of our lives,</v>

41
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.130
<v Speaker 2>there's a battle going on within</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves between the sacred and the</v>

42
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 2>profane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the evolutionary impulses and</v>

43
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:23.791
<v Speaker 2>the destructive tendencies that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>between creativity on the one hand and</v>

44
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 2>addictive behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

45
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:34.141
<v Speaker 2>between the divine and the Diabolico</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the light and the shadow between</v>

46
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:39.781
<v Speaker 2>the sacred and the profane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the [inaudible] Gita is a,</v>

47
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 2>an understanding of this battle that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have in our consciousness that</v>

48
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 2>ultimately is played out in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>battlefield,</v>

49
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 2>as you recall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our physical bodies in the physical</v>

50
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by understanding the dynamics of</v>

51
00:03:55.691 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 2>these forces within our own</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and by beginning to</v>

52
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:05.191
<v Speaker 2>harmonize our impulses with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary impulse within us,</v>

53
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 2>we heal ourselves.</v>

54
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.440
<v Speaker 2>And in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we heal not only our physical bodies but</v>

55
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.220
<v Speaker 2>our world because the world that we find</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves in is a projection both of our</v>

56
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 2>personal consciousness and our</v>
<v Speaker 2>collective consciousness.</v>

57
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:26.080
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's very relevant to modern</v>
<v Speaker 2>times when you see things like global</v>

58
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:31.081
<v Speaker 2>warming and climate chaos and changing</v>
<v Speaker 2>weather patterns and natural disasters</v>

59
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:36.751
<v Speaker 2>like Hurricane Katrina and extreme</v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty and economic disparities and</v>

60
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 2>social injustice and war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And terrorism.</v>

61
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.410
<v Speaker 2>These are the projection or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>collective consciousness that's in</v>

62
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:51.691
<v Speaker 2>disarray of a collective consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 2>where there is a rift in the collective</v>

63
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 2>soul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a collective consciousness that,</v>

64
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is evolving.</v>

65
00:04:58.481 --> 00:04:59.310
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

66
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 2>he was going through a lunch.</v>

67
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.310
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
