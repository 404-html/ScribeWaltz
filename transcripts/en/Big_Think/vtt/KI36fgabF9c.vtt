1
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in actual fact we haven't discovered a</v>

2
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 1>huge amount of obesity genes at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

3
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're almost certainly is and we know</v>

4
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:21.090
<v Speaker 1>that there are genes involved in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>development of predisposition to</v>

5
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>diabetes and so on and we know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes is going to becoming a massive</v>

6
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>problem over the next sort of 20 to 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

7
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Estimates in the range of $400,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million people with diabetes by 2030</v>

8
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 1>around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we're,</v>

9
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.510
<v Speaker 1>what we would like to understand is how</v>
<v Speaker 1>does your genetic predisposition</v>

10
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.310
<v Speaker 1>interact with your environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>predispositioned to,</v>

11
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

12
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

13
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of foods that you eat,</v>

14
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

15
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the piece that we want to try</v>

16
00:00:56.581 --> 00:01:01.581
<v Speaker 1>and understand and sort of tease apart</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what for diabetics,</v>

17
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean in terms of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>likelihood of getting cardiovascular</v>

18
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>disease and so on.</v>

19
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>So I think those are the areas in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be a lot of work to try and</v>

20
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:15.291
<v Speaker 1>sort of understand the differences in</v>
<v Speaker 1>populations and the differences in rates</v>

21
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>of obesity between different</v>
<v Speaker 1>populations.</v>

22
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>How much of that is genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of it is environment and what</v>

23
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>can one do to get a to get around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other?</v>

24
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.930
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of lifestyle changes can you</v>

25
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:32.160
<v Speaker 1>make to get around your genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>predisposition to developing obesity</v>

26
00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:35.340
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also what kind of behavioral</v>

27
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 1>components might make it difficult or</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy for you to do that?</v>

28
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's often very difficult for</v>

29
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>people to change their lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where I,</v>

30
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 1>that's where it's often a big challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we all know we're supposed to do in</v>

31
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:50.600
<v Speaker 1>order to keep healthy most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's difficult to do.</v>
