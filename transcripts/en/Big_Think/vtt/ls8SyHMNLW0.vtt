1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Ambiguity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradox,</v>

2
00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:03.690
<v Speaker 1>confusion are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.010
<v Speaker 1>also some of my favorite subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two lions that we often see in the</v>

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.271
<v Speaker 1>Far East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:12.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.950
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to represent confusion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and paradox and they guard the gate to</v>

8
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to get to heaven quote,</v>

9
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.890
<v Speaker 1>you have to be comfortable with</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion and with paradox and one</v>

10
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:31.770
<v Speaker 1>example of being comfortable with</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradox as a,</v>

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.800
<v Speaker 1>we often hear that we should accept life</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it is and uh,</v>

12
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>but of course there are many things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't accept a,</v>

13
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:44.640
<v Speaker 1>so we can have the paradox of accepting</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can't accept.</v>

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't accept violence against women</v>

15
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:53.001
<v Speaker 1>or children or even against other men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can accept that we can't accept</v>

16
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:53.964
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

17
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the paradox in this case,</v>

18
00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:59.390
<v Speaker 1>it's extremely important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

19
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a whitewash to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

20
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:03.690
<v Speaker 1>I accept everything.</v>

21
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nonsense to begin with.</v>

22
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where do you parts of,</v>

23
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>where do you say that you accept</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

24
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>something or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And being comfortable with the paradox</v>

25
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>of accepting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also accepting that we do not accept</v>

26
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

27
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how paradox plants plays itself</v>

28
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 1>out and confusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we live in an extremely complex</v>

29
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>world and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a straight and narrow.</v>

30
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Most things have an upside and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>downside and to weigh them out is,</v>

31
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

33
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.620
<v Speaker 1>we would love to have a very simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer and white answer is a good for me</v>

34
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 1>as a bad for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

35
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very rarely the case.</v>

36
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.310
<v Speaker 1>We evolved to want to have simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>answers because the brain then doesn't</v>

37
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 1>have to work overtime to analyze any</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation and the more complex the</v>

38
00:01:57.451 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>situation and the more confusing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more the brain has to work.</v>

39
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>That's why we don't like confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to have simple,</v>

40
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>straightforward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black and white answers,</v>

41
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.450
<v Speaker 1>but that's probably not going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>for anything.</v>

42
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I personally don't like the word right</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wrong,</v>

43
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because for different people,</v>

44
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:19.560
<v Speaker 1>right and wrong looks very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it can be coached and a</v>

45
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>little bit of a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I like to look at things that work or</v>

46
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:26.760
<v Speaker 1>that don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that human beings</v>

47
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.790
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally want life to flourish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We love and when we see life flourish,</v>

48
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:36.921
<v Speaker 1>be it a new flower or a tree sprouting</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the spring time or any beautiful new</v>

49
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Speaker 1>thing that we experience a new baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

50
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 1>it's just we'd love it and we have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really positive feeling towards when</v>

51
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>life flourishes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a so right and wrong,</v>

52
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.350
<v Speaker 1>gets it very much into a mental status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we compare to a whole list of what</v>

53
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:58.210
<v Speaker 1>we think is good for live on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we think is bad for life.</v>

54
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but underlying,</v>

55
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:05.641
<v Speaker 1>I think it's much more interesting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to whether something works</v>

56
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>to have life flourish or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you step on an ant,</v>

57
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>obviously that doesn't help very much</v>
<v Speaker 1>for life to flourish.</v>

58
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Is it right or wrong to kill a mosquito?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

59
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.261
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

60
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's works for me.</v>

61
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:24.421
<v Speaker 1>So the mosquito doesn't give me malaria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it helps my life to flourish.</v>

62
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 1>But obviously it doesn't help them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mosquitoes life to flourish.</v>

63
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's much more valuable to</v>

65
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 1>recognize it in terms of working and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>working rather than right and wrong.</v>
