1
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Visual intelligence is the concept that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see more than we can process and it's</v>

2
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 1>the idea of thinking about what we see</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking in the information and what do we</v>

3
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>really need to live our lives more</v>
<v Speaker 1>purposefully and do our jobs more</v>

4
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.200
<v Speaker 1>effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I asked the people in the art of</v>

5
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.360
<v Speaker 1>perception to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them is looking down at a piece</v>

6
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>of paper and the other one is looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the painting and then they have one</v>

7
00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>minute to describe what it is that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>see to their partner and the partner has</v>

8
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.520
<v Speaker 1>to sketch what they hear and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the artwork.</v>

9
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not about how well you draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how well can you describe a new set</v>

10
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>of unfamiliar data?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How well do you listen and how well do</v>

11
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:48.420
<v Speaker 1>you take that articulation and transfer</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to your own language?</v>

12
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

13
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.240
<v Speaker 1>How many of you said there was a train</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out of a fireplace and everyone</v>

14
00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:25.241
<v Speaker 1>raises his or her hands and how many of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you referenced smoke or steam in your</v>

15
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:28.850
<v Speaker 1>discussion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of hands go up and then I asked the</v>

16
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:32.210
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who mentioned who articulated that?</v>

17
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:36.680
<v Speaker 1>There are no tracks under the trade and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few astute people actually raised</v>

18
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:37.610
<v Speaker 1>their hand and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

19
00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:39.020
<v Speaker 1>I said there were no tracks under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>train,</v>

20
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 1>and then I asked who noticed and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated that there was no fire in</v>

21
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:46.820
<v Speaker 1>the fireplace and hands go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not too many.</v>

22
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.790
<v Speaker 1>And then we talk about other aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the painting.</v>

23
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:52.610
<v Speaker 1>How many people mentioned the woodgrain</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the floor.</v>

24
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Most people notice the wood grain on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>floor.</v>

25
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>How many people mentioned wainscoting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of paneling on the walls,</v>

26
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.390
<v Speaker 1>and I always have some decorative arts</v>
<v Speaker 1>aficionados.</v>

27
00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

28
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.370
<v Speaker 1>I know about wainscoting and then I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you mentioned a mantle on</v>

29
00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:09.440
<v Speaker 1>the fireplace?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of hands go up.</v>

30
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Who mentioned candlesticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of hands go up.</v>

31
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.860
<v Speaker 1>And then I asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you said there were no</v>

32
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:19.010
<v Speaker 1>candles in the candlesticks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people say,</v>

33
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never got there.</v>

34
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.560
<v Speaker 1>And then I ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

35
00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:24.710
<v Speaker 1>what really observant nerd said it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>1242 or eight.</v>

36
00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five on the clock.</v>

37
00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Who got to mention the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I asked I have that line</v>

38
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Speaker 1>of questioning is because this painting</v>
<v Speaker 1>illustrates a really very important</v>

39
00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:38.990
<v Speaker 1>concept that I transferred from</v>
<v Speaker 1>emergency medicine to a much broader</v>

40
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:42.380
<v Speaker 1>application and the idea is called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pertinent negative.</v>

41
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.280
<v Speaker 1>It's saying what isn't there in addition</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what is there to actually give a more</v>

42
00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:50.240
<v Speaker 1>accurate picture of what you're looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

43
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.200
<v Speaker 1>So when you say I see a train coming out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a fireplace,</v>

44
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.700
<v Speaker 1>and by the way there are no tracks under</v>
<v Speaker 1>the train and there is no fire in the.</v>

45
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Why would you attempt to say what's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

46
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Because in my third grade mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you told me to draw a fireplace,</v>

47
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I would draw two sticks and a fire and</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke in the fireplace unless you told</v>

48
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 1>me not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you told me to draw a pair of</v>

49
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>candlesticks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll draw candles with flames unless you</v>

50
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 1>tell me not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the pertinent negative is this</v>

51
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>wonderful concept that gives us a</v>
<v Speaker 1>broader way of looking at something.</v>

52
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Instead of looking at something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

53
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 1>you look at it like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the example,</v>

54
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>an example of how you apply that in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>real world.</v>

55
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>The pertinent negative in a medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation is when someone comes into the</v>

56
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 1>emergency room and they have all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>symptoms,</v>

57
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>it appears to the physician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have all the symptoms of pneumonia.</v>

58
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Pneumonia has three symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>symptom one is present symptom to is</v>

59
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if symptom three is absent,</v>

60
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>it's the pertinent negative.</v>

61
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>You have to say symptom three is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

62
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>therefore it's not pneumonia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the real world,</v>

63
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 1>outside of medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we use this?</v>

64
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 1>If we have an expectation of someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's behavior,</v>

65
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>you expect them to behave a certain way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they don't.</v>

66
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>You need to say it didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're evaluating someone on the job.</v>

67
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did A,</v>

68
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:17.190
<v Speaker 1>B and c very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't do the e and f.</v>

69
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 1>So it's looking at the affirmative and</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the negative and the</v>

70
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:25.030
<v Speaker 1>pertinent negative is a wonderful tool</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing missing persons cases.</v>

71
00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 1>You go to their homes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's not there?</v>

72
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>The cell phone's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The keys are not there.</v>

73
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.850
<v Speaker 1>The wallet is not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have a very different</v>

74
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:38.020
<v Speaker 1>search for that person if those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>were present instead of absent.</v>

75
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.460
<v Speaker 1>So this mughal painting gives us this</v>
<v Speaker 1>great opportunity to talk about not just</v>

76
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 1>what we see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what we don't see to give the person</v>

77
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:49.420
<v Speaker 1>who can't see what we see a much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate description of what they're</v>

78
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:49.900
<v Speaker 1>looking at.</v>
