00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably should clarify my spoon full</v>

2
00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:21.211
<v Speaker 1>of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way with running with scissors,</v>

3
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.910
<v Speaker 1>the humor was like a spoonful of sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes the medicine go down.</v>

4
00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:29.340
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just as humorous is a life raft in</v>

5
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.930
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible circumstances.</v>

6
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>It can kind of float you to the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe spot with running with scissors.</v>

7
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.350
<v Speaker 1>sprinkle some sugar onto a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a bitter piece.</v>

9
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.900
<v Speaker 1>It's that I would just not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would leave out the bigger piece,</v>

10
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolf at the table as much darker book,</v>

11
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Much Darker Book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both books though are like icebergs.</v>

12
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny little chunk above the surface of</v>

13
00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:15.301
<v Speaker 1>the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very small but yet kind of know what</v>

14
00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>else is underneath the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.390
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much going to be the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more.</v>

16
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.810
<v Speaker 1>And for that reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the period of my life and running with</v>

17
00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:29.230
<v Speaker 1>scissors was a lot more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was absolute madness</v>

18
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.540
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how I was going to turn</v>

19
00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:36.820
<v Speaker 1>out from that oven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was fun.</v>

20
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>But the time of my life before with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>father was not fun.</v>

21
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in order to write that wolf book,</v>

22
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.160
<v Speaker 1>I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.120
<v Speaker 1>I had to go back in my head to that time</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Shutesbury,</v>

24
00:01:58.641 --> 00:02:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts and I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.040
<v Speaker 1>I had to be with him again and even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though I'm a lot older now and he's</v>

26
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.210
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:19.211
<v Speaker 1>interesting information that matters not</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all because these memories are very,</v>

29
00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:21.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very vivid,</v>

30
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.660
<v Speaker 1>very vivid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while I was writing that book,</v>

31
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going through all the emotions,</v>

32
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:29.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would go through during the,</v>

33
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.160
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not fun.</v>

35
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.110
<v Speaker 1>It was I'm not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did it.</v>

36
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda had to do it for me and then I</v>

37
00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:44.750
<v Speaker 1>decided to publish it because I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.780
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I've learned anything from this</v>

39
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:52.220
<v Speaker 1>memoir thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that all the ways I thought I was a</v>

40
00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:56.300
<v Speaker 1>freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out there are other freaks that</v>

41
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:56.770
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>or people that have experienced the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

43
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>So I bet there are a lot of other guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I thought of guys who had the same</v>

44
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>father who went through the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even if there's only a few of them,</v>

45
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.640
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be useful for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 1>so that was the story over there with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
