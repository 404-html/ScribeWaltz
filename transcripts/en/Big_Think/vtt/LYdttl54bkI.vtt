1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.230
<v Speaker 1>It played over to come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.790
<v Speaker 1>today I think he would have a lot to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>about so many things,</v>

3
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:08.280
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but crowd sourcing would be of great</v>

4
00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:13.281
<v Speaker 1>interest to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take plato to the Google plex and he's</v>

5
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interested in our technology and,</v>

6
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:17.731
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

7
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:20.840
<v Speaker 1>that would appeal to him very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.900
<v Speaker 1>but he gets into a conversation at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google plex with a software engineer on</v>

9
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>a crowdsourcing and could crowdsourcing</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer the kind of ethical questions</v>

10
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>that he first raised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

11
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is,</v>

12
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:42.450
<v Speaker 1>he's quite interested in this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's very,</v>

13
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very down.</v>

14
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.720
<v Speaker 1>He's very much against it because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.180
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't have much of a faith in the</v>

16
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.790
<v Speaker 1>ethical opinions of the masses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought that ethics was a kind of</v>

17
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:03.380
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 1>that is extremely hard to attain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's right.</v>

19
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the reasons we've left him</v>

20
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:11.100
<v Speaker 1>so far behind.</v>

21
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 1>It's slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly where we make progress,</v>

22
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical progress.</v>

23
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he thought it was a kind of</v>

24
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and it takes a trained mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

25
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.071
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>it's harder than mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mathematics is a preparation for this</v>

27
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>kind of knowledge that you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of dispassion and distance</v>

28
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>from your own life to be able to access</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical knowledge.</v>

30
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:41.511
<v Speaker 1>So he would not have been very</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in crowdsourcing and what is</v>

31
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:47.571
<v Speaker 1>the opinion of the masses of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also would say,</v>

32
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then,</v>

33
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 1>how do we ever make any ethical</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress?</v>

34
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>How do we ever learn anything new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.200
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to challenge our,</v>

36
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.540
<v Speaker 1>our intuitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if in fact it's just being crowdsourced.</v>

37
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 1>I do have Plato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting quite addicted to the</v>

38
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:13.491
<v Speaker 1>Internet and looking up things on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Jana wikipedia constantly.</v>

39
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was partly,</v>

40
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed a quick way to bring him up to</v>

41
00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:19.974
<v Speaker 1>speed.</v>

42
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

43
00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:22.820
<v Speaker 1>and he is constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we carries,</v>

44
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>he gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well while he's at the Google plex,</v>

45
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>he gets a chromebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.100
<v Speaker 1>may give them a chromebook and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he carries it with him everywhere.</v>

47
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's constantly consulting it.</v>

48
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.701
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

49
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:34.140
<v Speaker 1>he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

50
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 1>he believed in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the expert.</v>

51
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he believed,</v>

52
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an expertise.</v>

53
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.241
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

54
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:44.060
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

55
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>aristotle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his student was actually says some</v>

56
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>things that are much more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>continent or a favorable toward</v>

58
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 1>crowdsourcing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

59
00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:58.050
<v Speaker 1>he says that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:58.051 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

61
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.380
<v Speaker 1>go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>a meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's just cooked by one person,</v>

63
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>you may not like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it's a feast with many,</v>

64
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>many people bringing their dishes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find something to like,</v>

65
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aristotle says,</v>

66
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:17.160
<v Speaker 1>and he really has an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a of crowdsourcing.</v>

67
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try to get as many points of view</v>

68
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 1>as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plato is,</v>

69
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.180
<v Speaker 1>is very dubious of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

70
00:03:24.181 --> 00:03:28.500
<v Speaker 1>he believes that it's extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to know anything.</v>

71
00:03:28.501 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>It takes a tremendous amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

72
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.630
<v Speaker 1>years and years of training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

73
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.700
<v Speaker 1>he has the rulers of his state studying</v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced mathematics for 10 years before</v>

74
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>they can even think about political</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>

75
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>That's how hard he thinks these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
