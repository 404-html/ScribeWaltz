1
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>So I think what's really fascinating is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there have been a number of recent</v>

2
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>studies looking at brain structural</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences between liberals and</v>

3
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:18.171
<v Speaker 1>conservatives and what's been found in</v>
<v Speaker 1>several studies is that liberals tend to</v>

4
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:24.651
<v Speaker 1>have a larger anterior cingulate gyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is an area that is responsible for</v>

5
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:31.341
<v Speaker 1>taking in new information and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact of the new information on</v>

6
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:36.651
<v Speaker 1>decision making or choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conservatives tended on the whole to</v>

7
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>have a larger right Amygdala,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Amygdala being a deeper brain</v>

8
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:44.050
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That process is more info,</v>

9
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional information,</v>

10
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:49.340
<v Speaker 1>specifically fear based information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

11
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>it's really responsible for the flight</v>
<v Speaker 1>or fright response.</v>

12
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>And this isn't everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not black and white.</v>

13
00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:59.940
<v Speaker 1>And of course then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about all of the people in the</v>

14
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But basically the study showed that if</v>

15
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>you just based it on brain structural</v>
<v Speaker 1>size difference,</v>

16
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>you could predict who would be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative and who would be a liberal</v>

17
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>with a frequency of 71 point six</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>

18
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.810
<v Speaker 1>71 point six percent is a pretty high</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to predict who is a conservative</v>

19
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:22.560
<v Speaker 1>and who was a liberal.</v>

20
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Just from brain structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at what your parents were</v>

21
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.170
<v Speaker 1>in terms of predicting what you might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of conservative versus liberal,</v>

22
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.750
<v Speaker 1>that enabled you to predict in studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a rate of 69 point five percent,</v>

23
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>so very close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not quite as good.</v>

24
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>And why is that interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because the brain is plastic.</v>

25
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>So the question as to whether you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain structure to start with that</v>

26
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:56.361
<v Speaker 1>informs whether you will be a liberal or</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative or whether the formation of</v>

27
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:01.920
<v Speaker 1>certain thoughts from your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

28
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.070
<v Speaker 1>shapes your brain structure because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain is plastic and ever changing,</v>

29
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.430
<v Speaker 1>particularly in youth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So does thinking certain thoughts or</v>

30
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>predominantly let's say utilizing your</v>
<v Speaker 1>right Amygdala versus your anterior</v>

31
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:18.910
<v Speaker 1>cingulate gyrus inform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.930
<v Speaker 1>the growth of those areas and therefore</v>
<v Speaker 1>help you predict later who is liberal</v>

33
00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>and who is conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in terms of interpreting the meaning</v>

34
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.460
<v Speaker 1>of a different sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>structures for a liberal versus a</v>

35
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 1>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to look at what that</v>

36
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>area is predominantly responsible for.</v>

37
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for conservatives,</v>

38
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>if you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amygdala is in large and that's the fear</v>

39
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>processing area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would expect,</v>

40
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe choices or decisions or character</v>

41
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:54.951
<v Speaker 1>and personality to be more informed by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>response to a fearful situation.</v>

42
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives,</v>

43
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:04.711
<v Speaker 1>in fact in personality studies do tend</v>
<v Speaker 1>to rate higher in areas of stability.</v>

44
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Loyalty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not liking change being more</v>

45
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.980
<v Speaker 1>religiously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

46
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in terms of decision making,</v>

47
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>having that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that rate higher for them in making</v>

48
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>certain choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at liberals from a</v>

49
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>personality character standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find stronger ratings in</v>

50
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:32.551
<v Speaker 1>terms of liking change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wanting to actually base decision</v>

51
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 1>making on new information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on science information.</v>

52
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.890
<v Speaker 1>And so those differences are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising in light of these brain</v>

53
00:03:45.021 --> 00:03:50.021
<v Speaker 1>structural differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being a liberal or being a conservative</v>

54
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>really is not a black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a bell shaped curve where</v>

55
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who considers themselves</v>

56
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe far less conservative,</v>

57
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than someone else who still calls</v>

58
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>themselves a conservative.</v>

59
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.980
<v Speaker 1>And that bell shaped curve continues all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way through where in the middle of</v>

60
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 1>there may be a large group that calls</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves independence.</v>

61
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>What we don't know is whether that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with differences in brain</v>

62
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:18.630
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

63
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 1>and so would we see in independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's done that study to say,</v>

64
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>independence,</v>

65
00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 1>don't show any differences in brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

66
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or any differences and say,</v>

67
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk taking reaction.</v>

68
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 1>So we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know for sure what that means,</v>

69
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.580
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's fair to say that even</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we looked at differences in brain</v>

70
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:43.000
<v Speaker 1>structure with the reliability of 71</v>
<v Speaker 1>point six percent,</v>

71
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.120
<v Speaker 1>that still leaves a very large number</v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't fit into that category.</v>

72
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:53.830
<v Speaker 1>where do they fall out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they more likely to be independence</v>

74
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 1>in their mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know the answer to that.</v>

75
00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>But certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.730
<v Speaker 1>these are not hard and fast rules.</v>

77
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.760
<v Speaker 1>This is not diagnostic science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

78
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.010
<v Speaker 1>and people who are independent obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>have certain characteristics I'll say,</v>

79
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:13.900
<v Speaker 1>of both sides are somewhere just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sound in the middle.</v>

80
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I think by understanding what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>structurally in the brain and</v>

81
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 1>functionally in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can better understand what informs</v>

82
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:27.190
<v Speaker 1>people's very strong opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

83
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.490
<v Speaker 1>that ultimately inform her political</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

84
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's one person,</v>

85
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 1>one vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in trying to change people's minds,</v>

86
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.120
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody has to look at what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the ability to change your mind,</v>

87
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it really changeable when,</v>

88
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>when we look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

89
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.190
<v Speaker 1>voting and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and changing minds and say,</v>

90
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:54.790
<v Speaker 1>political advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to recognize that all of that</v>

91
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>new information always comes in through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prism of your brain,</v>

92
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.030
<v Speaker 1>which means that what I say to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus you have maybe heard differently</v>

93
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:10.880
<v Speaker 1>even though I've said the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it comes in through the prism of,</v>

94
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.390
<v Speaker 1>does what you said make me nervous and</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid and therefore I'm going to resort</v>

95
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 1>to my old standby.</v>

96
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to change my decision or am</v>
<v Speaker 1>I going to hear the same information and</v>

97
00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:25.461
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

98
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 1>that's novel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a receptivity to novel</v>

99
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

100
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting to me and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think about whether I might change my</v>

101
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 1>mind based on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Information,</v>

102
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.190
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what the science is</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically saying to us that there are</v>

103
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:45.191
<v Speaker 1>going to be some people who are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear the information and retreat to</v>

104
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.270
<v Speaker 1>their original thinking and other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are going to hear new information</v>

105
00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:55.271
<v Speaker 1>and say that really does change my mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're trying to have a society that</v>

106
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.730
<v Speaker 1>will work in its own best interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that we do want to be able to</v>

107
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:06.560
<v Speaker 1>communicate with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're a liberal and say you</v>

108
00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:09.560
<v Speaker 1>want to talk to a conservative about gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage,</v>

109
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:15.070
<v Speaker 1>you want to have in your mind and how it</v>
<v Speaker 1>might still speak to loyalty,</v>

110
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.700
<v Speaker 1>stability and religious belief in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that you want to have those ideas in</v>

111
00:07:22.301 --> 00:07:26.150
<v Speaker 1>form your communication as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply saying,</v>

112
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.690
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this percentage of the population is</v>

113
00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 1>homosexual and therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 1>we should consider whether everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>should have those same rights.</v>

115
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.790
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science shows,</v>

116
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

117
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.910
<v Speaker 1>it's simply a fact your gay or not gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

118
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.370
<v Speaker 1>and therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't those people have the same</v>

119
00:07:46.371 --> 00:07:49.340
<v Speaker 1>rights?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the best way to appeal.</v>

120
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:54.341
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps to a conservative on this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to appeal to them in terms of</v>

121
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:57.020
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

122
00:07:57.021 --> 00:08:02.021
<v Speaker 1>a marital rules or history might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintained and not really altered for</v>

123
00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:08.570
<v Speaker 1>those who are in let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a traditional marriage of how it won't</v>

124
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.090
<v Speaker 1>interrupt the fabric for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

125
00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:13.730
<v Speaker 1>of their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the rules that they adhere to.</v>

126
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Those kinds of things would be more</v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing to them.</v>

127
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not that might be the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing argument to you as a liberal.</v>

128
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.570
<v Speaker 1>The truth is a conservative is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to be able to appeal to a liberal</v>

129
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.780
<v Speaker 1>using novel new information that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>science based and showing certain facts</v>

130
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:38.801
<v Speaker 1>and allowing for it not necessarily to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be purely religiously based,</v>

131
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that not be the rule system.</v>

132
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:46.730
<v Speaker 1>So to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by being empathically understanding.</v>

133
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:48.860
<v Speaker 1>And by that I don't mean sympathetically</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>

134
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:53.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean truly being able to stand in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other person's shoes and have some</v>

135
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 1>insight into where their brain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>directing them and appealing to that</v>

136
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:00.780
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you are conservative,</v>

137
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:05.781
<v Speaker 1>you will want to appeal with new</v>
<v Speaker 1>information because liberals are more</v>

138
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:10.880
<v Speaker 1>novelty seeking potentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

139
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:15.300
<v Speaker 1>and often science-based is a good way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>present new information.</v>

140
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Part of what's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

141
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:23.060
<v Speaker 1>in terms of what I'm seeing now is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually people are tending to double</v>

142
00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:28.251
<v Speaker 1>down on their own style and what appeals</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their own group of thinkers and that</v>

143
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:36.381
<v Speaker 1>is increasingly preventing the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication that would be important to</v>

144
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:42.351
<v Speaker 1>our future so that we can't so to speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>cross the aisle because it would require</v>

145
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:47.130
<v Speaker 1>trying on for size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thought pattern of the other group.</v>

146
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.870
<v Speaker 1>It would be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:51.840
<v Speaker 1>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's hard to do.</v>

149
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 1>I literally say that is difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a,</v>

150
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:56.730
<v Speaker 1>migdal is screaming at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

151
00:09:56.731 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 1>run for the hills or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>double down and fight.</v>

152
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.910
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

153
00:10:02.911 --> 00:10:05.440
<v Speaker 1>let me take a step back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

154
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:10.550
<v Speaker 1>and not have a fear based reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead present the science or</v>

155
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:16.251
<v Speaker 1>present the new information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good example would be that of gun</v>

156
00:10:16.501 --> 00:10:20.640
<v Speaker 1>ownership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I speak about gun ownership to a</v>

157
00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:25.200
<v Speaker 1>liberal group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they automatically have thoughts</v>

158
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:27.990
<v Speaker 1>probably about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly if they are in an urban</v>

159
00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:30.210
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime</v>

160
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:37.370
<v Speaker 1>and danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because statistically that is what they</v>

161
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:43.170
<v Speaker 1>have been privy to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the information has been given to them</v>

162
00:10:43.171 --> 00:10:46.350
<v Speaker 1>about how many homicides are committed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is,</v>

163
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dying by gun violence,</v>

164
00:10:48.391 --> 00:10:51.840
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I speak about gun ownership to a</v>

165
00:10:51.841 --> 00:10:55.860
<v Speaker 1>conservative group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are more likely in their loyal,</v>

166
00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:59.880
<v Speaker 1>stable way to think about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sportsmanship,</v>

167
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.580
<v Speaker 1>hunting with family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly again,</v>

168
00:11:02.581 --> 00:11:06.330
<v Speaker 1>if they're in a rural area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that is what they grew up with.</v>

169
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.390
<v Speaker 1>That is what has been stable for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the memory that they have about</v>

170
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:16.920
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can see how that's coming</v>

171
00:11:16.921 --> 00:11:19.560
<v Speaker 1>from two completely different</v>
<v Speaker 1>directions,</v>

172
00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:24.420
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the same word gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that it is hard to stand in the</v>

173
00:11:24.421 --> 00:11:26.130
<v Speaker 1>shoes for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

174
00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:27.600
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the other group.</v>

175
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you can,</v>

176
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.800
<v Speaker 1>you can come to make decisions about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

177
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:39.110
<v Speaker 1>the CDC has been prevented from doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>any research so that we could have new</v>

178
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.330
<v Speaker 1>science about gun violence as a public</v>
<v Speaker 1>health issue.</v>

179
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by actually the conservative political</v>

180
00:11:50.941 --> 00:11:53.300
<v Speaker 1>group has said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

181
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:58.240
<v Speaker 1>you can't do research on this area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We won't call it a public health issue.</v>

182
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.280
<v Speaker 1>And therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

183
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.530
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're prevented from getting dollars</v>

184
00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:07.120
<v Speaker 1>and prevented from having research into</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun violence per se,</v>

185
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:12.660
<v Speaker 1>and that comes probably from a fear</v>
<v Speaker 1>position that if there is any new</v>

186
00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:18.040
<v Speaker 1>information that sways a opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

187
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.520
<v Speaker 1>we will lose our loyal standing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that we firmly believe in and,</v>

188
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:28.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and harks back to very pleasurable,</v>

189
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:33.631
<v Speaker 1>comforting memories from earlier life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very complicated in a certain</v>

190
00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:36.610
<v Speaker 1>kind of way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

191
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the liberal group is wanting there to be</v>

192
00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:43.390
<v Speaker 1>this research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily to take guns away,</v>

193
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:48.660
<v Speaker 1>but to say we'd like to see the science</v>
<v Speaker 1>to validate whether or not certain</v>

194
00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:53.620
<v Speaker 1>things about guns or good for us or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for us.</v>

195
00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:00.100
<v Speaker 1>The most recent study looking at what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in the brain in terms of</v>

196
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:05.480
<v Speaker 1>politics predicted with the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>

197
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.890
<v Speaker 1>being able to identify a conservative</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus a liberal 82 point six percent.</v>

198
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:15.020
<v Speaker 1>And this was a look at brain activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is different.</v>

199
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.640
<v Speaker 1>You put someone in a functional Mri</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is different than just taking a</v>

200
00:13:19.641 --> 00:13:22.940
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It picks up activity in a certain area</v>

201
00:13:22.941 --> 00:13:27.941
<v Speaker 1>of the brain and found that when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have them do a risky behavior and look</v>

202
00:13:30.691 --> 00:13:35.691
<v Speaker 1>at their activity in their brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives were more likely to light</v>

203
00:13:36.271 --> 00:13:39.540
<v Speaker 1>up in the fright and flight response</v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

204
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:44.550
<v Speaker 1>The amygdala and liberals were more</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to light up in areas that have to</v>

205
00:13:44.971 --> 00:13:48.770
<v Speaker 1>do with social awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

206
00:13:48.771 --> 00:13:53.771
<v Speaker 1>you could see how therefore this</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference would inform what comes to</v>

207
00:13:54.141 --> 00:13:59.141
<v Speaker 1>the mind of either a liberal or</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative while either involved in a</v>

208
00:14:00.351 --> 00:14:05.150
<v Speaker 1>risky behavior or even something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening external to them,</v>

209
00:14:05.151 --> 00:14:08.090
<v Speaker 1>but feels like it might impact them in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>risky way.</v>

210
00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.340
<v Speaker 1>And that was actually even more</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictive than looking at structure of</v>

211
00:14:13.341 --> 00:14:18.140
<v Speaker 1>the brain or what your parents were in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of liberal versus conservative.</v>
