1
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.640
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of modern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing things were happening at the</v>

2
00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:12.850
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the United States of</v>

3
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.990
<v Speaker 1>America and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the movies and Hollywood.</v>

4
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.060
<v Speaker 1>We're one of those things that we kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think have lost track of how,</v>

6
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.780
<v Speaker 1>what a quantum shift watching movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:25.781 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 1>represented for the experience of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there,</v>

8
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.830
<v Speaker 1>there had been actors in plays before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

9
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first of all,</v>

11
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

12
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.670
<v Speaker 1>the glut of entertainment that suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 1>existed in the almost phantasmagorical</v>

13
00:00:40.871 --> 00:00:45.871
<v Speaker 1>quality of watching real people moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>around that were in front of you,</v>

14
00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:50.140
<v Speaker 1>but in some nether world and film and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were really in London or,</v>

15
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.101
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

16
00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:53.200
<v Speaker 1>or in India or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

17
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Yukon or whatever.</v>

18
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.071
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

19
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

20
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.650
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and time was suddenly changed that when</v>

21
00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:04.651
<v Speaker 1>from childhood to adulthood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything about the cinema was w w we</v>

22
00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>have to understand what a huge change</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was and,</v>

23
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.280
<v Speaker 1>and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how mutable it seemed to make reality.</v>

24
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>So you take that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

25
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:16.300
<v Speaker 1>the fact of cinema,</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV,</v>

26
00:01:16.301 --> 00:01:19.750
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything we now for five generations</v>

27
00:01:19.751 --> 00:01:24.751
<v Speaker 1>have taken as the way things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that that gave us,</v>

28
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.710
<v Speaker 1>gave us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially Americans,</v>

29
00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:29.350
<v Speaker 1>obviously French people and English</v>
<v Speaker 1>people as well,</v>

30
00:01:29.351 --> 00:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that,</v>

31
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.780
<v Speaker 1>that reality was mutable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then on top of that,</v>

32
00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:37.210
<v Speaker 1>and with that you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

33
00:01:37.211 --> 00:01:38.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrity culture,</v>

34
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.971
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

35
00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:43.330
<v Speaker 1>where celebrity itself is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>there are my orders of magnitudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly more celebrities.</v>

37
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.930
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.300
<v Speaker 1>in the 19th century and earlier there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

39
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.640
<v Speaker 1>there were a famous people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a few of them and,</v>

40
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.773
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.451
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

42
00:01:56.451 --> 00:01:57.284
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

43
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.900
<v Speaker 1>and now there were hundreds and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually thousands of famous people</v>

44
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.590
<v Speaker 1>who were now famous for pretending to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else,</v>

45
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.080
<v Speaker 1>actors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a strange new condition.</v>

46
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.640
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

47
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time,</v>

48
00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:14.200
<v Speaker 1>for much of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.060
<v Speaker 1>people looked up to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

50
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.150
<v Speaker 1>to movie stars because they seem to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>real potency in this world where,</v>

51
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals seen more and more part of a</v>

52
00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:25.870
<v Speaker 1>mass here.</v>

53
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Here were the people because they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous.</v>

54
00:02:28.061 --> 00:02:30.970
<v Speaker 1>And because we watched them and stared</v>
<v Speaker 1>at them and dreamed about them,</v>

55
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.991
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

56
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>we're the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little,</v>

57
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:38.181
<v Speaker 1>we're like superheros or demi gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the end of the 20th century or</v>

58
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.200
<v Speaker 1>before the end of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wouldn't?</v>

59
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.050
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an American,</v>

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steeped in this movie and then</v>

62
00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:48.520
<v Speaker 1>television culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be famous.</v>

63
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's no reason for you to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous,</v>

64
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:55.180
<v Speaker 1>but my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only famous people have real agency in</v>

65
00:02:55.181 --> 00:02:56.320
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

66
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to to that where,</v>

67
00:02:58.141 --> 00:02:59.940
<v Speaker 1>where fame is own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

69

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 1>there's advertising everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but advertising and the advertising</v>

71
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're really an American invention</v>

72
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>starting way back in the 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

73
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

75
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>the political candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential candidate,</v>

76
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:18.910
<v Speaker 1>William Henry Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the first marketed or advertised</v>

77
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>presidential candidate.</v>

78
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.460
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was this,</v>

79
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 1>this rich guy who they wanted to rebrand</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a humble guy,</v>

80
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>had grown up in a log cabin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So log cabins became his,</v>

81
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his icon,</v>

82
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:30.754
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

83
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>his branding symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they made real big ones and little</v>

84
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:35.550
<v Speaker 1>ones and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and liquor and,</v>

85
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.371
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

86
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>and facial creams in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in log cabin containers.</v>

87
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>And they made chants and songs and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>won by a landslide over a guy who was</v>

88
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 1>actually of humble origins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

89
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising as part of this fantasy</v>

90
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>industrial complex that is so American</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so defining of America,</v>

91
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>

92
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>has become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been a big part of what we're</v>

93
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:01.480
<v Speaker 1>talking about as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disneyland.</v>

94
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Disneyland.</v>

95
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.293
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

96
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became when it was created in the</v>

97
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>1950s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

98
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.340
<v Speaker 1>not just as a little amusement park to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to promote Walt Disney's animated films,</v>

99
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 1>but as this other version of reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was more,</v>

100
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 1>that was real in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was there,</v>

101
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 1>you could go there and buy things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>these old fashion shops on main street,</v>

102
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 1>USA with actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were selling you stuff.</v>

103
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

104
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 1>what happened in Disneyland and starting</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1955 did not stay there.</v>

105
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.000
<v Speaker 1>And that Main Street USA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of all became a kind of model for</v>

106
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 1>how you build shopping centers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you build a suburbs,</v>

107
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.240
<v Speaker 1>how you theme everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

108
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.160
<v Speaker 1>from restaurants to hotels to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to two shops to clubs.</v>

109
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.290
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

110
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

111
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 1>the Hollywood idea and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what came before in pop culture and</v>

112
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:04.450
<v Speaker 1>what came after and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as it expanded to sort of subsume</v>

113
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 1>all of American life is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

114
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

115
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.780
<v Speaker 1>is a big part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

116
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.020
<v Speaker 1>of how we as Americans have become so</v>
<v Speaker 1>iffy about telling what's fake from</v>

117
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 1>what's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's true from what's false.</v>
