1
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>I think cancer research right now is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a very interesting place.</v>

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about what has happened</v>

3
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>over the last 25 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has largely been identifying the</v>

4
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>hundred to 200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe slightly more than that,</v>

5
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>genes in the human genome that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved one way or another in</v>

6
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>controlling growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because cancer is fundamentally a</v>

7
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:33.261
<v Speaker 1>disease where growth is uncontrolled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the genes that are most important in</v>

8
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>understanding cancer are those growth</v>
<v Speaker 1>control genes.</v>

9
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:41.991
<v Speaker 1>And we're getting close to what I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>is probably a comprehensive list of</v>

10
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:48.591
<v Speaker 1>those genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next step is identifying which genes</v>

11
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>are important in which kinds of cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we're making real progress</v>

12
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then comes the hard part.</v>

13
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>And the hard part is turning that</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge into disease specific,</v>

14
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer treatments.</v>

15
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.080
<v Speaker 1>We have some early examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>success stories in this area.</v>

16
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Herceptin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was developed for the treatment of</v>

17
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>breast cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>leave act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was developed for the treatment of</v>

19
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>a lymphoma.</v>

20
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

21
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to be many,</v>

22
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>many more in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's really exciting about those</v>

23
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>therapies is unlike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>therapies that exist today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are largely poisons,</v>

25
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:39.111
<v Speaker 1>poisons that target dividing cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These new therapies are very,</v>

26
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 1>very specific and target the cancer cell</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

27
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I mean is that those drugs</v>

28
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>are going to be far more effective than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drugs we use today.</v>

29
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>And importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality of life of the patient is</v>

30
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>going to be significantly better because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not killing off hundreds of other</v>

31
00:01:58.171 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 1>cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>while you're trying to kill the cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

33
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.660
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
