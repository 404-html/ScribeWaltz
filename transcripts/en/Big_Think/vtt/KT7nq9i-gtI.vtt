<v Speaker 1>What we're leaving,</v>

2
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 15,</v>

3
00:00:14.421 --> 00:00:18.590
<v Speaker 2>20 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remind me of that.</v>

4
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:23.591
<v Speaker 2>All of the joke and the philosophy class</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the professor asks the students,</v>

5
00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:31.661
<v Speaker 2>which is worse ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ignorance or apathy and some poor kid</v>

6
00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:35.090
<v Speaker 2>from the back of the class says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know and I don't care.</v>

7
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an interesting question.</v>

8
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Is there an exciting way that we could</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the young people to this country</v>

9
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.590
<v Speaker 2>aware and their parents?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I refuse to believe that parents</v>

10
00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:55.130
<v Speaker 2>have suddenly become cold and</v>
<v Speaker 2>indifferent to their own kids and</v>

11
00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:56.000
<v Speaker 2>grandkids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parents,</v>

12
00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:01.001
<v Speaker 2>I think they've been deceived and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>misinformed and [inaudible] and so</v>

13
00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have a political system today,</v>

14
00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:11.561
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the elderly are unbelievably well</v>

15
00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:15.380
<v Speaker 2>represented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The American Association of Retired</v>

16
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Persons as 38 dues paying member,</v>
<v Speaker 2>38 million dues paying members.</v>

17
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.690
<v Speaker 2>They write more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lobby Mar,</v>

18
00:01:22.691 --> 00:01:25.880
<v Speaker 2>they call more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by and large,</v>

19
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:29.750
<v Speaker 2>it's not too unfair to say a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their programs are.</v>

20
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.540
<v Speaker 2>We want more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though by any reasonable standard,</v>

21
00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:37.190
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these challenges are</v>

22
00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:38.690
<v Speaker 2>unsustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't,</v>

23
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.430
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to be able to meet the</v>
<v Speaker 2>promises that we've made.</v>

24
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.170
<v Speaker 2>So on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have these,</v>

25
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.240
<v Speaker 2>this culture of our ethic of shared</v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice,</v>

26
00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:54.380
<v Speaker 2>being kind of a dirty word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not wanting to give up anything.</v>

27
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.410
<v Speaker 2>We have political organizations who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>dominant in representing one age group</v>

28
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.660
<v Speaker 2>and the young people who are all about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future or somehow being slipped.</v>

29
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:12.831
<v Speaker 2>This huge check,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hidden check I might add for our free</v>

30
00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:18.820
<v Speaker 2>lunch and nobody seems to be doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about it.</v>
