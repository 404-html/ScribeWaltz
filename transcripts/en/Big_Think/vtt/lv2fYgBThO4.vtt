00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's incredibly hard to stay focused.</v>

2
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.620
<v Speaker 1>There's so many distractions that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>around us at any given moment.</v>

3
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your pocket vibrates at any given</v>

4
00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:14.850
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A cause bigger,</v>

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.370
<v Speaker 1>getting 10 new emails and on social</v>
<v Speaker 1>media there's all these new</v>

6
00:00:18.371 --> 00:00:21.820
<v Speaker 1>notifications and the phone is ringing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your kids need help and your</v>

7
00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:24.920
<v Speaker 1>colleagues are coming up because you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>working in an open office plan and</v>

8
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.520
<v Speaker 1>they're asking you to chime in on some</v>
<v Speaker 1>memo.</v>

9
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Maintaining focus nowadays is harder</v>
<v Speaker 1>than ever before,</v>

10
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>but in some ways it's way more critical</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

11
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.110
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that we know about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most productive people and the most</v>

12
00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:43.111
<v Speaker 1>productive companies is that they create</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to enhance their focus.</v>

13
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.060
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they manage their mind in such a way</v>

14
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.590
<v Speaker 1>that they're able to focus on what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>important and ignore distractions much</v>

15
00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:53.290
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way that they do this is by</v>

16
00:00:53.291 --> 00:00:57.700
<v Speaker 1>what's known as building mental models,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially telling themselves stories</v>

17
00:00:57.701 --> 00:01:02.350
<v Speaker 1>about what they expect to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging in this kind of inner dialogue</v>

18
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.610
<v Speaker 1>about what they think should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening that allows their brain almost</v>

19
00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:10.510
<v Speaker 1>subconsciously to figure out what to pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to and what to ignore.</v>

20
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.690
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite examples of this is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big study that was done of nurses in</v>

21
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Nicu as some researchers from a group</v>
<v Speaker 1>named client associates went into some</v>

22
00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:25.090
<v Speaker 1>hospitals because they wanted to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out why some nurses were so good at</v>

23
00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:29.950
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to the right things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas others got distracted by all the</v>

24
00:01:29.951 --> 00:01:34.060
<v Speaker 1>noise and bustle around them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they found is that the best</v>

25
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.570
<v Speaker 1>nurses in Nicu is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the neonatal intensive care</v>

26
00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:42.520
<v Speaker 1>unit who are handling these babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nurses who are almost had a sixth</v>

27
00:01:42.521 --> 00:01:46.360
<v Speaker 1>sense or an esp about figuring out which</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies were sick and were getting</v>

28
00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:49.480
<v Speaker 1>sicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're the ones who were constantly</v>

29
00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:52.240
<v Speaker 1>telling themselves stories about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they expected to see as they were</v>

30
00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:57.241
<v Speaker 1>walking around the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of my favorite interviews from</v>

31
00:01:57.401 --> 00:01:59.800
<v Speaker 1>this study was with a nurse named</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darlene.</v>

32
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Darlene said that what she would do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she always was keeping a picture in</v>

33
00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:09.910
<v Speaker 1>her brain of what she thought that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect baby should look like.</v>

34
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.830
<v Speaker 1>And so she would walk through the unit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she would notice when babies didn't</v>

35
00:02:14.831 --> 00:02:17.140
<v Speaker 1>kind of match that picture in her brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

36
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.750
<v Speaker 1>And they would match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would mismatch that picture and</v>

37
00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:23.050
<v Speaker 1>kind of odd ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she might be walking past a crib</v>

38
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.460
<v Speaker 1>and she might expect a baby to be crying</v>
<v Speaker 1>because babies cry all the time.</v>

39
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.310
<v Speaker 1>And so if a baby was being uniquely</v>
<v Speaker 1>silent,</v>

40
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.370
<v Speaker 1>she would go over and she would try and</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what's going on.</v>

41
00:02:33.371 --> 00:02:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Like why is this baby being so quiet now</v>
<v Speaker 1>to all the other nurses are quiet baby</v>

42
00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:40.570
<v Speaker 1>seems like a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like that baby is happy and it</v>

43
00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:43.630
<v Speaker 1>doesn't need any attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to Darlene because she has this</v>

44
00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:47.890
<v Speaker 1>picture in her head of what the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby should look like when she sees a</v>

45
00:02:47.891 --> 00:02:51.070
<v Speaker 1>quiet baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she thinks that doesn't match the</v>

46
00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:51.730
<v Speaker 1>picture in my head.</v>

47
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.210
<v Speaker 1>I need to go pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she'd walk over and she'd see all</v>

48
00:02:55.211 --> 00:02:58.360
<v Speaker 1>these things that are all small issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their own,</v>

49
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The maybe the baby's blood was taken</v>

50
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>from its heel and instead of a dot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood on the bandaid,</v>

51
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>if there's a little bit of a bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>splotch,</v>

52
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the,</v>

53
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>the baby's temperature is a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevated,</v>

54
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>but nothing that like is out of place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing that's worrisome.</v>

55
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>But for Darlene and nurses like this who</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep this picture in their head,</v>

56
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>this mental model of what should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurring,</v>

57
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>all of those things don't jive with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story inside their head.</v>

58
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 1>And so as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their attention is grabbed by it and</v>

59
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>they start saying to themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

60
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Why is this baby bleeding a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than I expected?</v>

61
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Why is its temperature off just a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>degrees?</v>

62
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 1>And in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they discovered that the baby was</v>

63
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>incredibly sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there was not a lot of evidence that</v>

64
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:43.684
<v Speaker 1>it was second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

65
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>if they had waited half an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>45 minutes more,</v>

66
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.970
<v Speaker 1>the baby actually probably would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>passed away.</v>

67
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>But because Darlene noticed all of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things because the baby that she was</v>

68
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>seeing in real life didn't match the</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture in her head.</v>

69
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.080
<v Speaker 1>She acted immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started,</v>

70
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 1>they started the child on antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sepsis infection in its system was,</v>

71
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>was stamped out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the only reason that Darlene was</v>

72
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:10.450
<v Speaker 1>able to notice these warning signs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason she sort of had this esp</v>

73
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 1>or sixth sense for something going wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>was because she had a strong mental</v>

74
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had a picture in her head that she</v>

75
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>was comparing reality too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

76
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.510
<v Speaker 1>not all of us work in Nicu is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't work in hospitals.</v>

77
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 1>We're not dealing with life or death</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

78
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.190
<v Speaker 1>but think for a minute about what it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you walk into a meeting and</v>

79
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:33.450
<v Speaker 1>your boss asks you an unexpected</v>
<v Speaker 1>question or you're,</v>

80
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting there and you're,</v>

81
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 1>you're juggling the kids and dinner and</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly your phone vibrates and it's</v>

82
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>this email that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that causes the spike of panic.</v>

83
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Our instinct at a moment like that is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>react immediately to type something that</v>

84
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 1>we end up regretting later on or to</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer our boss and blurt something out</v>

85
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>and we think to ourselves afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

86
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I could've put that so much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>eloquently.</v>

87
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Why are some people so much better at</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintaining their focus and not reacting</v>

88
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 1>and not getting distracted by all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

89
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.190
<v Speaker 1>It's because ahead of time they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>envisioned what they expect to it to see</v>

90
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.710
<v Speaker 1>they've envisioned what they expect to</v>
<v Speaker 1>occur.</v>

91
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 1>So on the subway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're riding to work,</v>

92
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>they think about what is this day going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like?</v>

93
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I know that I'm going to this meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I expect to occur at that</v>

94
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Speaker 1>meeting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when they walk in and their boss</v>

95
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:25.330
<v Speaker 1>asked them some unexpected question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they their brain,</v>

96
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>almost subconsciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

97
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.460
<v Speaker 1>I didn't expect that question to occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't matching the picture in my</v>

98
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>brain of what I anticipated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I need to put that question off.</v>

99
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 1>I need to to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we take that offline and I'll answer</v>

100
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:39.460
<v Speaker 1>that later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they have a picture in their brain of</v>

101
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:42.400
<v Speaker 1>what it's going to be like to to deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the kids and to make dinner.</v>

102
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>There's some type of expectation and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a result,</v>

103
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>when their pocket buzzes and an email</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in,</v>

104
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.330
<v Speaker 1>they can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't handle this right now.</v>

105
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:52.690
<v Speaker 1>I need to give myself five minutes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll deal with this later.</v>

106
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>I use this all the time.</v>

107
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 1>They used to be that when I would ride</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subway into work,</v>

108
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>I would spend that time reading the</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper or I would try and get caught up</v>

109
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:02.871
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:07.871
<v Speaker 1>memos or or something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I do now is I put everything away</v>

111
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.660
<v Speaker 1>and I spend that 30 minutes just trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to envision what is this day going to be</v>

112
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 1>like because I know that the more that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have thought through what's about to</v>

113
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more that I have a strong vision in</v>

114
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>my mind of what I should expect and</v>
<v Speaker 1>anticipates,</v>

115
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.260
<v Speaker 1>the more my subconscious is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to decide this is what you should</v>

116
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 1>focus on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what you can safely ignore.</v>

117
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to train my brain by just</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a couple of minutes of thinking</v>

118
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:43.451
<v Speaker 1>through what's about to occur to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>better decisions about where my focus</v>

119
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 1>should actually be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>
