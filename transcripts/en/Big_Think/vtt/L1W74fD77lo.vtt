00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Best messages in any given negotiation</v>
<v Speaker 1>are really implied,</v>

2
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.680
<v Speaker 1>indirectly come to the other person</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on thinking that you're getting</v>

3
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:18.080
<v Speaker 1>them to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting them to get some really solid</v>

4
00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:23.081
<v Speaker 1>thought behind their answers and so a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great thing to send someone an email is</v>

5
00:00:24.171 --> 00:00:29.030
<v Speaker 1>have you given up on this project</v>
<v Speaker 1>because nobody likes to give up on</v>

6
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:34.031
<v Speaker 1>anything and at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to say yes to that because</v>

7
00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:38.300
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what they're letting</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in for when they say yes.</v>

8
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.690
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because that particular</v>

9
00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:46.691
<v Speaker 1>email has restarted negotiations that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen dead silence for weeks prior</v>

10
00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:53.111
<v Speaker 1>to that and simply sending that email</v>
<v Speaker 1>all by itself and in many cases you can</v>

11
00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:57.590
<v Speaker 1>get a response within three to five</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes of reading the email or the</v>

12
00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:00.620
<v Speaker 1>text.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great way to get things</v>

13
00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:01.970
<v Speaker 1>restarted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

14
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:06.170
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that is there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good chance you contributed to</v>

15
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:11.171
<v Speaker 1>the silence in the first place</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your next move when they respond is</v>

16
00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:16.610
<v Speaker 1>you've got to get a that's right out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them next because they have to feel like</v>

17
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.040
<v Speaker 1>that their communication is being paid</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to.</v>

18
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Summary is designed to let the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>side know that you really understand</v>

19
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:28.670
<v Speaker 1>what's going on now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if nothing else,</v>

20
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.110
<v Speaker 1>at least you understand their position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of negotiators that</v>

21
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:38.111
<v Speaker 1>really will give in on a deal because</v>
<v Speaker 1>being understood is more important than</v>

22
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>getting what they want in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.030
<v Speaker 1>the assertive negotiator being</v>
<v Speaker 1>understood is actually more important to</v>

24
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:48.710
<v Speaker 1>them than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than actually making the deal.</v>

25
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>So everybody wants to be understood</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

26
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Let people know you completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand where they're coming from and</v>

27
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>that's the design of a summary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>summarizing the facts and how they feel</v>

28
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:06.531
<v Speaker 1>about the facts and actually if you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>summarize their feelings about the facts</v>

29
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:10.200
<v Speaker 1>that are driving them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that they're blind to will make a</v>

30
00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:13.230
<v Speaker 1>big difference to them because then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel really understood that empathy</v>

31
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>connection is there and they may</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually change their mind about what</v>

32
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>decisions they've made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One empathy has been established.</v>
