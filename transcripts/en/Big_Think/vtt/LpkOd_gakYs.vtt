1
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of universities are looking for</v>

2
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:17.100
<v Speaker 1>partners in India and a faculty</v>
<v Speaker 1>exchanges,</v>

3
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>student exchanges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are enormously beneficial also to</v>

4
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>I think the important development that</v>
<v Speaker 1>has happened in America,</v>

6
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.750
<v Speaker 1>to my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that all the major universities are</v>

7
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>setting up India study centers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they will have an Indian studies</v>

8
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:40.281
<v Speaker 1>initiative as Howard has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yale has started to offer a major in</v>

9
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>South Asian studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 90% of South Asian studies is really</v>

10
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Indian studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Berkeley and Stanford have had</v>

11
00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>longstanding collaborations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A number of business schools are being</v>

12
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>set up in collaboration with American</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>

13
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>The Indian School of Business in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hyderabad,</v>

14
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>in collaboration with Kellogg has</v>
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>

15
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>after just five years of its founding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>become one of the top 20 schools in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

17
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.540
<v Speaker 1>So that's the kind of</v>

18
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.760
<v Speaker 2>dynamics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very exciting for us.</v>
