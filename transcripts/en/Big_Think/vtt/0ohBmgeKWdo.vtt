1
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pretty scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3
00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:14.510
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a lot,</v>

4
00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:15.500
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

5
00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:17.690
<v Speaker 1>it all sounds pretty political at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the day.</v>

6
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.553
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and without getting political and all </v>

7
00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:21.530
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

8
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.090
<v Speaker 1>I think the big unfortunate thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that as soon as it starts to hit home</v>

9
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.240
<v Speaker 1>and it starts to affect us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there seems to be,</v>

10
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an effect,</v>

11
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there seems to be a reaction if </v>

12
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 1>there's outreach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you look around the world,</v>

13
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is normal for a lot of people.</v>

14
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.413
<v Speaker 1>This is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's surprising that it's even a </v>

15
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.730
<v Speaker 1>surprise to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's shocking that it's a shock.</v>

16
00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:51.050
<v Speaker 1>It's shocking to me that nobody takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for,</v>

17
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a world that someone in chaos right now </v>

19
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.620
<v Speaker 1>and has been for a number of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

20
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.990
<v Speaker 1>none of this is new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

21
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.660
<v Speaker 1>so that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without getting all dreary and stuff,</v>

22
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been around for a long time and,</v>

23
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we all have responsibility.</v>

24
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.063
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

25
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.863
<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's a matter of time that it </v>

26
00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:21.690
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like everything else,</v>

28
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.160
<v Speaker 1>hopefully we'll get through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

29
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.630
<v Speaker 1>when it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it does happen,</v>

30
00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I hope it doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure it will.</v>

31
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all we could do is,</v>

32
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.740
<v Speaker 1>is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.430
<v Speaker 1>put our heads down and hunker down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

34
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.550
<v Speaker 1>and do what we have to do to get to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

35
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.423
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

36
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.663
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we have a choice in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter of these laws are getting passed </v>

37
00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:53.690
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

38
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are being affected and,</v>

39
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.980
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually,</v>

40
00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

41
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:01.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of time before,</v>

42
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before fall,</v>

43
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:05.630
<v Speaker 1>guys just out outright banned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

44
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.360
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

45
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.760
<v Speaker 1>it's call it what you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

46
00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:13.400
<v Speaker 1>some people would say it's risky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's irresponsible to do it in the first</v>

47
00:02:13.401 --> 00:02:14.234
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those would say it's responsible to </v>

48
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.740
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Eh,</v>

49
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

50
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.020
<v Speaker 1>in all that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trans fats,</v>

51
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:22.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effect that it has on,</v>

52
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.650
<v Speaker 1>is all politics and it's a matter of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

54
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>standpoint.</v>

55
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.370
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all this,</v>

56
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.020
<v Speaker 1>all this is it's a little beyond me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a simple cook,</v>

57
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.970
<v Speaker 1>opening a restaurant in east village</v>

58
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 3>foods</v>

59
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.800
<v Speaker 1>set up clipping friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fats.</v>

60
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:48.634
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't have an effect on me at </v>

61
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I understand how a lot of people,</v>

62
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:59.991
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people need to live by fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>food restaurants.</v>

64
00:03:00.141 --> 00:03:00.974
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sometimes the only food that they </v>

65
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:03.094
<v Speaker 1>can afford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would like to think in a perfect </v>

66
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:07.654
<v Speaker 1>world that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the fast food restaurants would </v>

67
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>take the responsibility to serve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foods a little bit healthier without the</v>

68
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>government having having to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>

69
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately it's just not the world we</v>

70
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

71
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not gonna,</v>

72
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be the boy that cried </v>

73
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>trans fats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but will say that,</v>

74
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sometimes desperate times call for </v>

75
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 1>desperate measures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously</v>

76
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.263
<v Speaker 3>I happened</v>

77
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>and I really think about it and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of evolution.</v>

78
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.050
<v Speaker 1>Evolution takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way I think about,</v>

79
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.273
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually going into maybe a fine </v>

80
00:03:48.231 --> 00:03:51.110
<v Speaker 1>dining restaurant one day becomes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to kind of,</v>

81
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.350
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reign yourself in completely and take</v>

82
00:03:54.351 --> 00:03:58.040
<v Speaker 1>a fine dining approach outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>casual restaurants and things like that.</v>

83
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.310
<v Speaker 1>But a fine dining approached by reigning</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in and doing,</v>

84
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Barber I think does it very well.</v>

85
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.113
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even Michael Anthony does it very well </v>

86
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.150
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of shifts that do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

87
00:04:08.151 --> 00:04:09.980
<v Speaker 1>and of course I'm not going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the whole list,</v>

88
00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:12.950
<v Speaker 1>but those are the two that really come </v>
<v Speaker 1>to mind,</v>

89
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

90
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cook from the land,</v>

91
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.280
<v Speaker 1>the simplicity and the beauty of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

92
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:21.434
<v Speaker 1>to listen to Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barbara speak about these things and </v>

94
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.500
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his eloquence with it.</v>

95
00:04:24.501 --> 00:04:25.910
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

96
00:04:25.911 --> 00:04:27.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

97
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.240
<v Speaker 1>So he's the guy you got to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not me.</v>

98
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.350
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

99
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

100
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 3>my grandfather lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost</v>

101
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.620
<v Speaker 1>his farm when my father was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was young.</v>

102
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.710
<v Speaker 1>So there's always that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 1>it's in the back of my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

104
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.360
<v Speaker 1>and I still have family up in the north </v>
<v Speaker 1>and main that live that are farmers.</v>

105
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

106
00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do what you can within the confines </v>

107
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.580
<v Speaker 1>of Your Business and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things being what they are and,</v>

108
00:05:04.581 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economics of a restaurant being what</v>

109
00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:08.494
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's unfortunate that you </v>

110
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.640
<v Speaker 1>the difference between an organic egg </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a commercial lake.</v>

112
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.923
<v Speaker 1>Now you look at the way a commercial leg</v>
<v Speaker 1>is raised and you look at the way an </v>

113
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 1>organic egg is raised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

114
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately it costs more than three </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

115
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.500
<v Speaker 1>The organic aid cost more than three </v>
<v Speaker 1>times they commercially raised egg.</v>

116
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.380
<v Speaker 1>So the economics of a restaurant being </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is and you know,</v>

117
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.810
<v Speaker 1>occupancy costs of restaurants in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York City being what they are,</v>

118
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.450
<v Speaker 1>there's only so much you could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes without,</v>

119
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>customers are still price sensitive and </v>

120
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.970
<v Speaker 1>savvy for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously in New York City.</v>

121
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 1>So you do what you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

122
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.270
<v Speaker 1>you want to be responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never want to be a responsible.</v>

123
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.403
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully what that means is that </v>

124
00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I can grow into more</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more over time.</v>

125
00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Back to the evolution of it.</v>

126
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.163
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

127
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

128
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.070
<v Speaker 1>there's where there's a will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a way,</v>

129
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.113
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

130
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.273
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that there's so much </v>

131
00:06:14.401 --> 00:06:16.050
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

132
00:06:16.051 --> 00:06:17.970
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with commercial farming,</v>

133
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.440
<v Speaker 1>commercial food products that it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an easy cop out,</v>

134
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.873
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if we put ourselves on a path to </v>

135
00:06:26.221 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 1>kind of get to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.033
<v Speaker 1>maybe it may take time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually we'll get to the point </v>

137
00:06:31.171 --> 00:06:32.700
<v Speaker 1>where it is feasible</v>

138
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.210
<v Speaker 3>just called by restraint.</v>

139
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

140
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.730
<v Speaker 1>three bowls of ice cream I shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have had.</v>

141
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.570
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't that fat is the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

142
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

143
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:51.410
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was also a big baseball player and all</v>

145
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.320
<v Speaker 1>that kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

146
00:06:52.321 --> 00:06:53.154
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

147
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.040
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.873
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

149
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

150
00:06:57.571 --> 00:06:58.860
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always a concern,</v>

151
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want your children to be active.</v>

152
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.180
<v Speaker 1>You don't want them to sit in front of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV and playing video games.</v>

153
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's easier for me to,</v>

154
00:07:05.401 --> 00:07:08.760
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy for me as a non parent to</v>

155
00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.140
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what kids should do.</v>

156
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.153
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to play that game again </v>
<v Speaker 1>because every parent in the world of </v>

157
00:07:13.741 --> 00:07:15.450
<v Speaker 1>tell me what an ass I am.</v>
