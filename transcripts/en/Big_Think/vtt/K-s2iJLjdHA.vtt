00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't apply the term journalists to</v>

2
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we operate with some,</v>

3
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.790
<v Speaker 1>a journalistic practices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by no means what I carry that title.</v>

4
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.860
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a terrible question that's often asked</v>

5
00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:31.490
<v Speaker 1>by a sort of mainstream media for trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to grasp this.</v>

6
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.430
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not mutually exclusive.</v>

7
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 1>There is journalism that appears on</v>
<v Speaker 1>blogs.</v>

8
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>So I guess that's blogging and</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalism.</v>

9
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there are sites like mine that</v>

10
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:45.380
<v Speaker 1>are journalistic but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:48.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't sort of hard fast sticking to</v>

12
00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:51.470
<v Speaker 1>that definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I think you have random</v>

13
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.120
<v Speaker 1>rambling 13 year olds who are printing</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever idea pops in their head.</v>

14
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.370
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's just blogging.</v>

15
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.361
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:04.361
<v Speaker 1>I think every mainstream publication out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there from time to the New York Times is</v>

17
00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:10.571
<v Speaker 1>trying to jump on this blogging</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon and they are using journalism</v>

18
00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 1>to fuel that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just happens to appear online in</v>

19
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:14.660
<v Speaker 1>different forms.</v>
