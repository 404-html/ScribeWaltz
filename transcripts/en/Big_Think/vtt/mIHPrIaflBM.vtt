1
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.360
<v Speaker 2>it might be the greatest task facing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say the next American president on the</v>

3
00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:17.100
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy realm is to reestablish</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moral authority of the United States</v>

4
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 2>as a human rights actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to overstate the case that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the US does still have an important</v>

6
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:27.200
<v Speaker 2>voice say to stop genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.240
<v Speaker 2>the US has actually been an important</v>
<v Speaker 2>rhetorical voice under four because the</v>

8
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.350
<v Speaker 2>United States does not commit mass</v>
<v Speaker 2>murder.</v>

9
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:35.184
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

10
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 2>ethnically cleansing hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people.</v>

11
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 2>So in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is still some residual moral</v>

12
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 2>authority to the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The US can also credibly promote</v>

13
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.500
<v Speaker 2>democracy because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

14
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 2>whatever flaws we have in the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>

15
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 2>it still is a credible democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the US cannot,</v>

16
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:57.390
<v Speaker 2>with a straight face promote the fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>against torture,</v>

17
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.340
<v Speaker 2>fight against foreseeable disappearance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight against arbitrary detention</v>

18
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 2>and the fight against unfair trials</v>
<v Speaker 2>because these are all abuses that the</v>

19
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Bush administration is practiced in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>name of fighting terrorism.</v>

20
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.380
<v Speaker 2>So the real challenge facing a new</v>
<v Speaker 2>government is to end those practices,</v>

21
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 2>to repudiate them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hold the author's accountable in some</v>

22
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 2>meaningful way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to recommit the United States to</v>

23
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.730
<v Speaker 2>serious respect for human rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the tough moments,</v>

24
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 2>even when the US is at threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in doing that,</v>

25
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.920
<v Speaker 2>I think that the United States can</v>
<v Speaker 2>reclaim its position as one of the</v>

26
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 2>leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not the leader of the human rights</v>

27
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 2>movement at the governmental level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is absolutely essential.</v>

28
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 2>I think in the longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the human rights movement is to have</v>

29
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 2>the power that is enjoyed in an earlier</v>
<v Speaker 2>era.</v>
