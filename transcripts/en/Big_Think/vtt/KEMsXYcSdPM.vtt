1
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.020
<v Speaker 1>When you sit down and observe your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind on purpose just for fun,</v>

2
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a kind of</v>

3
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.550
<v Speaker 1>scientific inquiry into</v>
<v Speaker 1>what drives you,</v>

4
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.700
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say if you</v>

5
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>focus on say the breath is the object of</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and you're riding on the way</v>

6
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.480
<v Speaker 1>as you're breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't take long before you'll</v>

7
00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:40.481
<v Speaker 1>notice that I'm some kind of want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes up some kind of desire and maybe</v>

8
00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:47.231
<v Speaker 1>it's because your body is uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you just want to fidget a</v>

9
00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:49.370
<v Speaker 1>little or shift posture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:53.720
<v Speaker 1>and just do it this way or that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so very hard to sit still.</v>

11
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we're antsy.</v>

12
00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Why are we answering?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we want to be comfortable and</v>

13
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:01.880
<v Speaker 1>we're not comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rather than the holding the</v>

14
00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:06.850
<v Speaker 1>discomfort</v>
<v Speaker 1>in awareness because why should we</v>

15
00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:08.530
<v Speaker 1>privilege comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfort,</v>

16
00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:11.710
<v Speaker 1>discomfort?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there is no ultimate comfort.</v>

17
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.150
<v Speaker 1>That's why we shift from one leg to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other and we're always very shifty.</v>

18
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.230
<v Speaker 1>But if you actually train yourself to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied,</v>

19
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.380
<v Speaker 1>you get less shifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the mind just naturally settles.</v>

20
00:01:23.381 --> 00:01:27.340
<v Speaker 1>The body naturally settles and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be comfortable</v>

21
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.930
<v Speaker 1>at home in your own skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're not and you want</v>

22
00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:39.670
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call that greed.</v>

23
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.563
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

24
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's greedy at wants something now that</v>

25
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.400
<v Speaker 1>wanting to just be comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine,</v>

26
00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:49.450
<v Speaker 1>but when you start to watch the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice that it's got a lot of</v>

27
00:01:49.451 --> 00:01:53.620
<v Speaker 1>agendas on the greed spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

28
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.010
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an greed is not quite the same as</v>

29
00:01:57.011 --> 00:01:59.410
<v Speaker 1>ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to do with greed,</v>

30
00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:03.640
<v Speaker 1>has to do with more for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of what I want from me.</v>

31
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Then there's this other thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll also notice,</v>

32
00:02:06.971 --> 00:02:10.120
<v Speaker 1>which is you're sitting there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite will come up.</v>

33
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.180
<v Speaker 1>What I don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm afraid of,</v>

34
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 1>what I need to keep at the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep at bay to push a way.</v>

35
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.690
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's collectively referred to as</v>

36
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.460
<v Speaker 1>aversion or dislike or hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:02:27.461 --> 00:02:32.461
<v Speaker 1>when it's really strong and direct the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphin that other people or whatever,</v>

38
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.940
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

39
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.180
<v Speaker 1>So we've got greed on the one hand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is toxic.</v>

40
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>The more you're sucked into greed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more go testicle you become,</v>

41
00:02:43.691 --> 00:02:47.800
<v Speaker 1>the more it's all about me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you're willing to sort of lose</v>

42
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:52.060
<v Speaker 1>your own ethical foundation to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular result only to find that even</v>

43
00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:55.390
<v Speaker 1>that results not really satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're onto the next result and it's</v>

44
00:02:55.391 --> 00:03:00.391
<v Speaker 1>a never ending trajectory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But nevertheless have to admit it's here</v>

45
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

46
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've transcended greed,</v>

47
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we do transcend greed,</v>

48
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>but we can transform how we are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to it.</v>

49
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>And with awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greed doesn't have to run us.</v>

50
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 1>And even if it's attenuated five or 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>

51
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be its own form of</v>

52
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>liberation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nevermind.</v>

53
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>Thirty or 40 or 50 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the same with the aversion,</v>

54
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 1>like what I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so bloody boring to sit here and</v>

55
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 1>watch my breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

56
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who thinks it's boring?</v>

57
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you looked at your boredom?</v>

58
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.370
<v Speaker 1>So have you looked at your aversion then</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as the you that's looking at</v>

59
00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:45.150
<v Speaker 1>your revision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more like awareness.</v>

60
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Awareness of aversion isn't diversive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awareness of greed isn't greedy.</v>

61
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.790
<v Speaker 1>So you're free already have those too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toxic impulses.</v>

62
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Then there's another one which is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the madness that passes for</v>

63
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.570
<v Speaker 1>the scenario in our heads and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>often spoken of as illusion or delusion</v>

64
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.160
<v Speaker 1>that we're kind of like got these</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely half baked explanations about</v>

65
00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:17.400
<v Speaker 1>everything and who we are and where</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are going and what's wrong with</v>

66
00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:22.401
<v Speaker 1>the world and what's wrong with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>family and what's right and all of that</v>

67
00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:23.790
<v Speaker 1>is Kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of it's true.</v>

68
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.020
<v Speaker 1>None of it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we believe it that that narrative</v>

69
00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:31.260
<v Speaker 1>mode and that mind wandering default</v>
<v Speaker 1>mode network,</v>

70
00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:36.261
<v Speaker 1>that's like my favorite pastime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of me and it's diluted and it</v>

71
00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:41.751
<v Speaker 1>also drains a huge amount of energy so</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can bring mindfulness to greed and</v>

72
00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:46.710
<v Speaker 1>the greed can be attenuated or</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberated.</v>

73
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Mindfulness to a version and the version</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be attenuated,</v>

74
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.680
<v Speaker 1>deliberate or mindfulness to our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>diluted nature,</v>

75
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.340
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and emotions and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is liberating of them.</v>

76
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Then what do you have left</v>

77
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.703
<v Speaker 2>you</v>

78
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.110
<v Speaker 1>as pure awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully embodied what comes next?</v>

79
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're writing the script.</v>

80
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

81
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.380
<v Speaker 1>then you'll feel this and you'll feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and you'll be enlightened and</v>

82
00:05:16.381 --> 00:05:21.150
<v Speaker 1>everybody will bow down to you and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know you will never have to have any</v>

83
00:05:21.151 --> 00:05:26.151
<v Speaker 1>kind of challenges or difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The full catastrophe will evaporate</v>

84
00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:27.230
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

85
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.390
<v Speaker 1>it'll be the same old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same old,</v>

86
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.520
<v Speaker 1>only you won't be the same old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same because you,</v>

87
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.530
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be the same.</v>

88
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.470
<v Speaker 1>You'll have the same bank account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have the same social security</v>

89
00:05:40.471 --> 00:05:42.630
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the same face in the mirror.</v>

90
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.660
<v Speaker 1>It'd be aging everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you will be in wiser relationship to</v>

91
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:52.881
<v Speaker 1>your possibilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to your embodied</v>

92
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
<v Speaker 1>enacted unfolding of those possibilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment by moment,</v>

93
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 1>and that means life lived fully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

94
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:11.030
<v Speaker 1>You have a chance while we have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chance,</v>

95
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 1>as far as I know you didn't ask to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>born this pure gravy.</v>

96
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.540
<v Speaker 1>It's just a total gift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even with all the pain and suffering and</v>

97
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:25.400
<v Speaker 1>the trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I recognize the profundity of that</v>

98
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:29.490
<v Speaker 1>and the rendering quality of the still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

99
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a gift and your gift and</v>
<v Speaker 1>silence in some sense at that point</v>

100
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.680
<v Speaker 1>becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>wakefulness.</v>

101
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.770
<v Speaker 1>It's radiant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's luminous,</v>

102
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.490
<v Speaker 1>and it's already you.</v>
