00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.270
<v Speaker 1>I agree with the premise of the question</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the rate of change is just so</v>

2
00:00:14.271 --> 00:00:16.700
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's through globalization or</v>

3
00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:21.260
<v Speaker 1>technology that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it were ever true that you could do</v>

4
00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>sort of a five year plan and then just</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it aside and executed.</v>

5
00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:27.050
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly not true today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:28.880
<v Speaker 1>and there is a constant need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovate.</v>

7
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.350
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways that we've benefited</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we do a lot of our business</v>

8
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.920
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 1>in partnership structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:42.491
<v Speaker 1>whether that's in the US or globally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that allows us to kind of go to</v>

11
00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:43.940
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>

12
00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:46.820
<v Speaker 1>on what other organizations are also</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

13
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.310
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the mobile sector.</v>

14
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you only looked at the u s market</v>

15
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:53.600
<v Speaker 1>where frankly our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:57.950
<v Speaker 1>cell phones and our networks are so far</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind,</v>

17
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's possible to do with,</v>

18
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:03.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mobile devices in Europe or in Asia,</v>

19
00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 1>that you wouldn't even see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities.</v>

20
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.010
<v Speaker 1>But because we're a global company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were able to see six years ago the</v>

21
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:17.531
<v Speaker 1>potential for those devices being</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment devices as well as,</v>

22
00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:21.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>email and phone devices.</v>

23
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>And began striking deals with companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>overseas to test different kinds of</v>

24
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:30.800
<v Speaker 1>content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was games or video.</v>

25
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.160
<v Speaker 1>So I think looking outside of your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization and working with your</v>

26
00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:39.920
<v Speaker 1>partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even vendors can be an interesting</v>

27
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:41.590
<v Speaker 1>source of innovative ideas.</v>
