1
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.040
<v Speaker 1>I tried to hear everything that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and that that can be very,</v>

2
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:09.380
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3
00:00:09.381 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>and someone who tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>I hear everything that's happening on</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage is lying cause there's,</v>

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>there's almost no way I think to really</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

6
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>But as an exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do try to identify,</v>

7
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that musician,</v>

8
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Speaker 1>the third flute playing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I tried to make sure I can hear</v>

9
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to hear what's going on</v>

10
00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:29.840
<v Speaker 1>because if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a way I,</v>

11
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Speaker 1>I've used the analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's like a ball,</v>

12
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>a very big ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can affect the way the ball rolls</v>

13
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:39.980
<v Speaker 1>and you can change the direction that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ball is rolling if it's already is,</v>

14
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>if it's already in motion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't suddenly have a turn,</v>

15
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>an abrupt angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a natural way that the,</v>

16
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.730
<v Speaker 1>the ball can be guided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though you're steering the ball,</v>

17
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>there's a natural momentum that the ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>has that you can't interfere with.</v>

18
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>So if the orchestra has a certain flow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can affect the flow.</v>

19
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>But there's a natural way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a way that actually would</v>

20
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 1>interrupt the natural flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that you can just do</v>

21
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to take into account what is</v>

22
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:10.870
<v Speaker 1>happening and what is being offered from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the players.</v>

23
00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 1>So that means really being in touch with</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing and hearing them as</v>

24
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>well as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's surprisingly difficult to,</v>

25
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>to really identify not even with two or</v>
<v Speaker 1>three or four lines,</v>

26
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:24.470
<v Speaker 1>but even just one line to really hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the,</v>

27
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>the will and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sense that the players are</v>

28
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>giving to one line to really listen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and to actually be able to react to</v>

29
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>it in a meaningful way is surprisingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

30
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's difficult.</v>

31
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what happens is,</v>

32
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's more than one current,</v>

33
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>if they're conflicting currents onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to make a choice.</v>

34
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>You have to either give in or insist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for the other musicians on stage,</v>

35
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 1>if they sense two currents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they say for example,</v>

36
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.240
<v Speaker 1>if I show one thing and they hear a</v>
<v Speaker 1>response to that,</v>

37
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 1>that is not in sync,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they have a dilemma they have to</v>

38
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:09.510
<v Speaker 1>choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I go with what I see from the</v>

39
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:13.080
<v Speaker 1>conductor or do I go with what I hear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I very often tell,</v>

40
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 1>tell the orchestra's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the New York Philharmonic,</v>

41
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:17.334
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I really want you to play with my bead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I care about.</v>

43
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 1>You're following me that precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that I want to take the</v>

44
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:30.690
<v Speaker 1>element of choice out of the question so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are not forced to decide,</v>

45
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I follow him or do I not follow him?</v>

46
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>There has to be just one current.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

47
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 1>mistakes happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accidents happen.</v>

48
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:40.230
<v Speaker 1>If something goes wrong then you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to use your sense and that's based</v>

49
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 1>on experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either you given,</v>

50
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.030
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's better to give in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow it to sort of write itself over</v>

51
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:47.520
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other Times you sort of dig your heels</v>

52
00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 1>in and you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

53
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where it is.</v>

54
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.770
<v Speaker 1>And it creates a discomfort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an uncomfortable moment.</v>

55
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.633
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

56
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 1>you try to use your best sense and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't say it's a always one way or</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

58
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.280
<v Speaker 1>or it's always another way is you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to figure out what the best way to</v>

59
00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:05.400
<v Speaker 1>get out of those situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully they're not too frequent.</v>
