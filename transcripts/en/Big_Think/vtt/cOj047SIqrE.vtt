1
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.370
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in suburbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salt Lake City,</v>

2
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Utah for the most part just right</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of salt lake.</v>

3
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the oldest of six,</v>

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>kind of a very typical mormon</v>
<v Speaker 1>upbringing,</v>

5
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>very wholesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to lab church.</v>

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.771
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I joined the army when I was 17.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a program that allows you to</v>

8
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>join like the reserves or the national</v>
<v Speaker 1>guard or the reserves while you're still</v>

9
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:32.360
<v Speaker 1>in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to boot camp,</v>

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back,</v>

11
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:36.030
<v Speaker 1>finish your senior year and then go back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and training and finish all your</v>

12
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.340
<v Speaker 1>advanced training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

13
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>so that's what I did right after I</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned 17 in January and I hadn't listed</v>

14
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.810
<v Speaker 1>by February.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enlisted the day after the ground war,</v>

15
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first Gulf war started.</v>

16
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.120
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I've always told people why I</v>

17
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:52.050
<v Speaker 1>joined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>

18
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.030
<v Speaker 1>the most honest answer I can give you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the why I joined is that I was 17 and</v>

19
00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the first adult decision that I</v>

20
00:00:59.251 --> 00:00:59.871
<v Speaker 1>got to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

21
00:00:59.871 --> 00:01:01.650
<v Speaker 1>I grew up playing gi joe and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

22
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a fun thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

23
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.061
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

24
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:03.841
<v Speaker 1>I can kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>be a boy scout or a kid for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetually.</v>

26
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.030
<v Speaker 1>And that appealed to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I joined.</v>

27
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I haven't talked about this one in</v>

28
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>the wild that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was okay.</v>

29
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happens in Utah and moved to New</v>

30
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>York City in 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The towers come down in September,</v>

31
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>2001.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>of course my initial reaction is one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>complete disbelief.</v>

33
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>We live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.930
<v Speaker 1>they say how sometimes you can look</v>
<v Speaker 1>right at something and not believe it.</v>

35
00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the first time I've ever really</v>

36
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>experienced that where I get a phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>call,</v>

37
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:37.030
<v Speaker 1>my buddy says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

38
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>the towers had been hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

39
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.580
<v Speaker 1>shut up asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't come in for new.</v>

40
00:01:39.581 --> 00:01:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Never again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And don't tell me ridiculous crap like</v>

41
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:42.474
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

42
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Then I realized it's not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching the news walk out to west</v>

44
00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Broadway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time I walked out to west</v>

45
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Broadway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first tower had already fell and I'm</v>

46
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>looking right at where it was and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>not seeing it.</v>

47
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the tower?</v>

48
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

49
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking on that sky and I couldn't</v>

50
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:03.000
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could not process that.</v>

51
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>The time I was in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walk away to try and watch some news</v>

52
00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:06.910
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

53
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should just watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go back a second time.</v>

54
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Now the second tower tower is fallen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean it's probably instead of</v>

55
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.200
<v Speaker 1>business lean of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>the feeling of complete disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>

57
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured pretty much any national</v>

58
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>guardsman in New York City at that time</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew they were going to get called up.</v>

59
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>So we just all without being told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started like congregating at our</v>

60
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:31.440
<v Speaker 1>respective armories and we were at</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground zero or near Ground Zero that</v>

61
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first two days we guarded,</v>

62
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an area a few blocks away,</v>

63
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the sites.</v>

64
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.460
<v Speaker 1>And then by the third day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the third week of the 11th day,</v>

65
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>so I guess it was like a 20 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

66
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>we just did what we do as soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is guard stuff.</v>

67
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.450
<v Speaker 1>We'd work 12 hour shifts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

68
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>my platoon in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was stationed between buildings four</v>

69
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:56.760
<v Speaker 1>and five and all we did was guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We set up a perimeter,</v>

70
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around a big,</v>

71
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.470
<v Speaker 1>and our job was to simply screen who</v>
<v Speaker 1>came in to the whole,</v>

72
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fire chief was in charge of the site</v>

73
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.761
<v Speaker 1>and he would tell us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

74
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>here I'm going to own the ironworkers in</v>
<v Speaker 1>or only let in ems world was the dogs.</v>

75
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just kind of said their garden stuff</v>

76
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>and told people who didn't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct authorization from the fire</v>

77
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>chief to fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which was actually kind of interesting</v>

78
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:28.921
<v Speaker 1>because anyone who has a suit or badge</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything was down there to include</v>

79
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CIA,</v>

80
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Nsa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys like,</v>

81
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

82
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 1>everyone showed up there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>firefighters came from a Minnesota</v>

83
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>wanting to help and we had to turn away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was kind of heartbreaking.</v>

84
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was her job is to kind of guard</v>

85
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:46.114
<v Speaker 1>a big hole.</v>

86
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.350
<v Speaker 1>There was some kind of unscrupulous</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that I think a lot of people don't</v>

87
00:03:52.351 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>love talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

88
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.640
<v Speaker 1>looting was a bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

89
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

90
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.470
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to thing about it because it's</v>

91
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:03.540
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we think about a ground zero and</v>

92
00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:07.140
<v Speaker 1>nine 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the incredibly heroic things</v>

93
00:04:07.141 --> 00:04:09.300
<v Speaker 1>that took place that day and the amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the outpouring of,</v>

94
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.200
<v Speaker 1>basically it was love that came from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were in the army.</v>

95
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.740
<v Speaker 1>We have just kids in the lower east side</v>
<v Speaker 1>go running around with like doughnut</v>

96
00:04:15.741 --> 00:04:17.940
<v Speaker 1>carts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving us donuts just because they want</v>

97
00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:20.070
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was all these wonderful stories.</v>

98
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.520
<v Speaker 1>But then there's also the storage to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have I like,</v>

99
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.380
<v Speaker 1>but there was a soldier in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.580
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of our soldiers had found like a box</v>

101
00:04:26.581 --> 00:04:30.480
<v Speaker 1>of money and he didn't think that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even cross his mind that it was wrong to</v>

102
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.553
<v Speaker 1>dilute it.</v>

103
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.050
<v Speaker 1>He ended up getting kicked out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>army or just being an idiot.</v>

104
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.990
<v Speaker 1>There were some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there were some problems too with</v>

105
00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:41.991
<v Speaker 1>people who are in positions of trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were taking advantage of the fact</v>

106
00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:44.430
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the stores,</v>

107
00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>especially in the basements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

108
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.500
<v Speaker 1>of the World Trade Center are now broken</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unguarded.</v>

109
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's really kind of a sore</v>

110
00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:57.330
<v Speaker 1>spot for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I details some,</v>

111
00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm being kind of careful about what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>say about it,</v>

112
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.520
<v Speaker 1>but there were some problems with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

113
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.080
<v Speaker 1>it was handled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully that's kind of the end of</v>

114
00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:07.200
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
