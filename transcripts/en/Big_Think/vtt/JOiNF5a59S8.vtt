1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.830
<v Speaker 2>I have teenage boys and I started</v>
<v Speaker 2>investing with them when they were 12</v>

3
00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:17.530
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ideally the best time is when they're</v>

4
00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:20.860
<v Speaker 2>teenagers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big believer that those people who</v>

5
00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:25.861
<v Speaker 2>have been exposed to investing at an</v>
<v Speaker 2>early age are going to be much more</v>

6
00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:28.990
<v Speaker 2>comfortable with the whole process as</v>
<v Speaker 2>adults.</v>

7
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 2>So ideally parents starch start teaching</v>
<v Speaker 2>their kids when they're teenagers,</v>

8
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open up a custodial brokerage account,</v>

9
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 2>help them choose stocks and mutual funds</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let them be a part of the process.</v>

10
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.730
<v Speaker 2>But that's not always the case because</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we found from our studies is that</v>

11
00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:46.480
<v Speaker 2>so many adults are not equipped to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>sound financial decisions.</v>

12
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Their parents didn't talk about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

13
00:00:49.061 --> 00:00:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>schools didn't teach them and so they're</v>

14
00:00:52.691 --> 00:00:54.280
<v Speaker 2>not in a position to teach their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

15
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.900
<v Speaker 2>So the second best place to start</v>
<v Speaker 2>investing is when you become in the</v>

16
00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:00.700
<v Speaker 2>workforce when you're 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

17
00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:05.701
<v Speaker 2>22 years old and he worked for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporation that offers a 401k.</v>

18
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.200
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our studies show that that's really when</v>

19
00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:13.030
<v Speaker 2>people begin to learn to invest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it's up to the corporation to</v>

20
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.200
<v Speaker 2>provide financial education and literacy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and encourage their employees to take</v>

21
00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:20.140
<v Speaker 2>advantage of this retirement vehicle</v>

22
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.220
<v Speaker 2>because young people have more time to</v>
<v Speaker 2>weather the ups and downs of the stock</v>

23
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:33.980
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're in a much better position to</v>

24
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:38.870
<v Speaker 2>take on more risk and you know with what</v>
<v Speaker 2>little more risk you get a little more</v>

25
00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:42.530
<v Speaker 2>reward and that would be a reason to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take on more risk.</v>

26
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.310
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really depends on your,</v>

27
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much you can stomach it,</v>

28
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you sleep at night when there are</v>

29
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:53.180
<v Speaker 2>bigger dips in the market?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you do have a bigger</v>

30
00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:57.950
<v Speaker 2>percentage of stocks in your portfolio</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have a big downmarket that your</v>

31
00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 2>portfolio is going to react more so than</v>
<v Speaker 2>say if you had less stock and more</v>

32
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:03.560
<v Speaker 2>bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

33
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.090
<v Speaker 2>over the long term history shows that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take on a little more risk,</v>

34
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.970
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get more return.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But keep in mind,</v>

35
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.350
<v Speaker 2>there is a sweet spot where there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take on a little bit too much</v>

36
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:17.120
<v Speaker 2>risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get that much more</v>

37
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:18.920
<v Speaker 2>return.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So consider,</v>

38
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the very least I'm saying,</v>

39
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:22.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say for a young person in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their twenties,</v>

40
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.440
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

41
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:26.410
<v Speaker 2>it's very personal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

42
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.040
<v Speaker 2>at least 80% in a diversified stock</v>
<v Speaker 2>portfolio for their retirement account</v>

43
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.550
<v Speaker 2>or for those accounts that they know</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to touch and they're</v>

44
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:37.280
<v Speaker 2>going to build upon over the year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>save for the next 40 years.</v>

45
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
