00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.820
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

2
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was an artist,</v>

3
00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:15.621
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what I did was collage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would bring together disparate</v>

4
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 2>elements and then when they be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they got side by side,</v>

5
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 2>there is a kind of magical child born</v>
<v Speaker 2>from those disparate elements.</v>

6
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.710
<v Speaker 2>And that's my creative process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll bring in some music,</v>

7
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 2>maybe unexpected music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll bring in some readings.</v>

8
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 2>I might take five books and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>randomly open to different pages.</v>

9
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might go for a walk.</v>

10
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when these things are placed side by</v>

11
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:49.380
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

12
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 2>interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

13
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 2>in the best of circumstances there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>magical child and that's my creative</v>

14
00:00:56.431 --> 00:01:01.431
<v Speaker 2>process is collage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like being immersed in life rather</v>

15
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Speaker 2>than separating yourself.</v>

16
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.940
<v Speaker 2>A person that I look to for inspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely Sharon Gannon.</v>

17
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sharon is the prime mover of Jeeva,</v>

18
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 2>do yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was her,</v>

19
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 2>her magical child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

21
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivates me on a daily basis,</v>

22
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with her,</v>

23
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.660
<v Speaker 2>her high hopes and her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

24
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.580
<v Speaker 2>her optimism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend to be a little bit pessimistic</v>

25
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 2>and I get mired in that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

26
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 2>what's the use?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Sharon always brings me back,</v>

27
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

28
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

29
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do right now in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next few minutes?</v>

30
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.050
<v Speaker 2>What could you do to make the world a</v>
<v Speaker 2>better place?</v>

31
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's constantly filled with new</v>

32
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 2>ideas and new possibilities and new</v>
<v Speaker 2>projects.</v>

33
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 2>So many projects I have to run to keep</v>

34
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.570
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
