1
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really tough question is it's</v>

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>kind of like asking a what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the five countries you should</v>

3
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>know about if you're not interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>geology or geography or politics?</v>

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the answer varies depending on what</v>

5
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 1>your actual interests are or what are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the five companies you should know.</v>

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

7
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:26.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

8
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>and the answer changes over time too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back when I was getting started,</v>

10
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Lo these many decades ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>the answers would have been Fortran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cobol,</v>

12
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>lists and maybe Apl,</v>

13
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

14
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>those were very formative languages back</v>
<v Speaker 1>then and people learned a lot from</v>

15
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these days,</v>

16
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be more important for you to</v>

17
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:56.270
<v Speaker 1>know a Java script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if I'm a,</v>

18
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>the only reason you know that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you know,</v>

19
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 1>whether or not to click the enabled Java</v>
<v Speaker 1>script button in your browser,</v>

20
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but javascript is a nice lightweight</v>

21
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>object oriented language.</v>

22
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

23
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why it can fit in a browser,</v>

24
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

25
00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:16.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do these things such as,</v>

26
00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:17.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.790
<v Speaker 1>run little programs that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.713
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.740
<v Speaker 1>help you input your data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then send it off to a web server</v>

30
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:24.420
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are heavier weight,</v>

32
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.150
<v Speaker 1>a object oriented languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>the elephant in the room is sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Java.</v>

35
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>You can't really make a list of modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages without talking about it.</v>

36
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Java is sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.630
<v Speaker 1>the Cobol of the 21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a kind of heavyweight,</v>

38
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>a verbose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

39
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>everyone loves to hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

40
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>everyone will admit that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but managers kind of like it because,</v>

41
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like you're getting a lot done.</v>

42
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>if 100 lines of Java code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>accomplish a task,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it looks like you've written a</v>

45
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 1>hundred lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though in a different language,</v>

46
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:12.240
<v Speaker 1>it might only take five lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:13.021
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

48
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:14.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.120
<v Speaker 1>you can eat a one pound steak or you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a,</v>

50
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 pounds of shoe leather and you feel</v>

51
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>a greater sense of accomplishment after</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shoe leather.</v>

52
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.403
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's some downsides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

54
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.740
<v Speaker 1>but it also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

55
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>because it is sort of considered an</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial language and programmers,</v>

56
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:36.681
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of interchangeable parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a managers like it for that reason,</v>

57
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>and for that reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of Java jobs that have been</v>

58
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>outsourced from the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

59
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what other languages?</v>

60
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

61
00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:50.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going in a different direction,</v>

62
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>coming more from academia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a language like a Haskell,</v>

63
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.430
<v Speaker 1>which we call a functional programming</v>
<v Speaker 1>language that means function in a</v>

64
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>mathematical sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in the sense of the other language</v>

65
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:08.670
<v Speaker 1>or other languages are dysfunctional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

66
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.160
<v Speaker 1>but a function mathematically has an</v>
<v Speaker 1>input and an output and it maps to,</v>

67
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:16.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a great deal of a mathematical</v>

69
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>certainty what those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what those are.</v>

70
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.620
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

71
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a</v>

72
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Haskell is one of those languages that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematician type minded people love.</v>

73
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.270
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a language for geniuses by</v>

74
00:03:39.271 --> 00:03:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

75
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 1>so you should probably know about it if</v>
<v Speaker 1>only to be able to say,</v>

76
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this Kinda like Haskell?</v>

77
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>And if so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

78
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:51.230
<v Speaker 1>you have to hire some really smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to,</v>

79
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to program manage A.</v>

80
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Haskell is sort of a modern kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lists in that sense.</v>

81
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else?</v>

82
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

83
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 1>we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't leave off modern languages</v>

84
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:10.381
<v Speaker 1>without talking about c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the c language that's just spelled with</v>

85
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>the letter c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>m is actually about 40 years old.</v>

86
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.900
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

87
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.870
<v Speaker 1>people have tried to replace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see with other languages that are,</v>

88
00:04:18.871 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 1>are like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have by and large,</v>

89
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:26.221
<v Speaker 1>not succeeded because a c is a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>minimalistic language and very close to</v>

90
00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:31.620
<v Speaker 1>the metal as we say on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a machine and lets you get down and</v>

91
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.690
<v Speaker 1>do very fine grain stuff very</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiently.</v>

92
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 1>But it's a lot of hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you've done that work,</v>

93
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.450
<v Speaker 1>you can run it pretty much everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So almost all the other languages that</v>

94
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Java,</v>

95
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Perl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

96
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually if you look down underneath,</v>

97
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 1>they're actually implemented and see or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in a closely related language.</v>

98
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

99
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.201
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

100
00:04:56.201 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>that continues to be a very fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>language if only because everyone is</v>

101
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:03.460
<v Speaker 1>trying to reinvent it and not succeeding</v>
<v Speaker 1>in doing so.</v>

102
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.730
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

103
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 1>for a fifth language a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

104
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:09.580
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably want to pick one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scripting languages.</v>

105
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

106
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.560
<v Speaker 1>there's several to choose from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's python,</v>

107
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>there's Ruby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course I am prejudiced in favor</v>

108
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>of Pearl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

109
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.260
<v Speaker 1>because I think it has the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

110
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.890
<v Speaker 1>the liveliest community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

111
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 1>and because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

112
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.310
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

113
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.310
<v Speaker 1>have intentionally been redesigning it</v>
<v Speaker 1>lightly to leap frog,</v>

114
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

115
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:33.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other languages,</v>

116
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

117
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>for the last number of years we've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>redesigning it to take out all the warts</v>

118
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.110
<v Speaker 1>that we've noticed over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we figured it was our one chance to,</v>

119
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a break,</v>

120
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 1>backward compatibility,</v>
