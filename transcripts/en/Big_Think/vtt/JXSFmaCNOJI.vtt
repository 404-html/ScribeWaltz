1
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.290
<v Speaker 1>It is in part that and part to mimic</v>
<v Speaker 1>our collective memories.</v>

2
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.330
<v Speaker 1>All of us that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.400
<v Speaker 1>memories of strange thing that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>

4
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.300
<v Speaker 1>how much of today do I remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's already abstracted,</v>

6
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>but I've already of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>utterly obliterated almost every</v>

7
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>syllable to come out of my mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gone.</v>

8
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:34.050
<v Speaker 1>It's history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about yesterday?</v>

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.020
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember every dish I washed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every scab I picked,</v>

10
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>every person I encountered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

11
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.480
<v Speaker 1>it's every meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ate hundreds and thousands of them.</v>

12
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that out of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>99%,</v>

13
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>probably a lot more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been a race that is biliterate it</v>

14
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 1>erase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't remember a detail.</v>

15
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not just talking about</v>

16
00:00:58.381 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about a Delta and people</v>

17
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>I've cared deeply about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember them and loving ways and</v>

18
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:08.400
<v Speaker 1>yet have a few snapshots of memory.</v>

19
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>And we hold onto those and we call a</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>

20
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little</v>

21
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.320
<v Speaker 1>remnant of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a lifetime.</v>

22
00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>That's what's left to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we attach this word memory to it,</v>

23
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>which cylons has a silent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>encompassing all.</v>

24
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that certainly applies to the things</v>

25
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>they carried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a book partly about memory.</v>

26
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.350
<v Speaker 1>The author of that book is an older guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's looking back and he's recycling</v>

27
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:46.521
<v Speaker 1>event from different angles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes inventing things as a way of</v>

28
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>seeking that which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is gone</v>

29
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>ghostly</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good friendship.</v>

30
00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:02.961
<v Speaker 1>Merrick who stepped on a landmine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>was blown into this tree and uh,</v>

31
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:09.051
<v Speaker 1>he's been dead a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet in the writing of the things</v>

32
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>they carried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to sunway resurrect through</v>

33
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:14.640
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is last thoughts may have been as</v>

34
00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>he sorted into that tree as sunlight is</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing me.</v>

35
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm making it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm trying to sort of cast a light</v>

36
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:28.731
<v Speaker 1>on that which has been darkened by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a history in the passage of time to</v>

37
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.820
<v Speaker 1>let chip keeps soaring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

38
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said as long as I book is Rad,</v>

39
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>that guy's going to keep soaring into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hedge for you know,</v>

40
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 1>and that tree and as long as the book is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rad Little Linda at the end of the book,</v>

41
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:49.071
<v Speaker 1>is it going to keep skating on that ice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Little Timmy will be in love with</v>

42
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:55.581
<v Speaker 1>her and skating along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is what</v>

43
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.621
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

44
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not saving their bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not even saving the memories of</v>

45
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>these people really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saving something like you hope</v>

46
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>that's essential and enduring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the human spirit,</v>

47
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>the love of a little boy for a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl and a good friend who soared into a</v>

48
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>tree and a terrible war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something,</v>

49
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's something.</v>
