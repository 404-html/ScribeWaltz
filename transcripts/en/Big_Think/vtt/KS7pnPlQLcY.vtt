1
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.650
<v Speaker 1>81% of white evangelicals voted for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump in the previous election.</v>

2
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.710
<v Speaker 1>That's a record that's more white</v>
<v Speaker 1>evangelicals than voted for George W.</v>

3
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And George W.</v>

4
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Bush was a white evangelical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This makes no sense to people,</v>

5
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.210
<v Speaker 1>especially when you consider that trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not just the most irreligious</v>

6
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 1>president in modern history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That his entire worldview makes a</v>

7
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:41.621
<v Speaker 1>mockery of core Christian values like</v>
<v Speaker 1>humility and empathy and care for the</v>

8
00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:44.330
<v Speaker 1>poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.630
<v Speaker 1>that this individual who couldn't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>name a single verse in the Bible when</v>

10
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:54.821
<v Speaker 1>asked to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet and yet received a record number</v>

11
00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.700
<v Speaker 1>of votes by white evangelicals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scholars of religion,</v>

12
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.900
<v Speaker 1>normal rational people have been trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out why,</v>

13
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.550
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

14
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.460
<v Speaker 1>And I think that there's a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to keep in mind.</v>

15
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's white evangelicals.</v>

16
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.000
<v Speaker 1>81% of white evangelicals voted for</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>

17
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:22.001
<v Speaker 1>but 67% of evangelicals of color</v>
<v Speaker 1>supported Hillary Clinton.</v>

18
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are people who believe the exact</v>

19
00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose only real difference is that is</v>

20
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:31.820
<v Speaker 1>the color of their skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's not ignore the fact that there</v>

21
00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:35.240
<v Speaker 1>is a racial element to this support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

22
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.430
<v Speaker 1>Jim Wallace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head of the sojourners,</v>

23
00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:41.570
<v Speaker 1>a liberal evangelical group said it best</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he said that these white</v>

24
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:45.740
<v Speaker 1>evangelicals quote acted more white than</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did evangelical.</v>

25
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.300
<v Speaker 1>And I think he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second reason I think it has to do</v>

26
00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:53.120
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pernicious influence of something</v>

27
00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:57.290
<v Speaker 1>called the Prosperity Gospel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is gripped the imaginations of</v>

28
00:01:57.291 --> 00:02:01.430
<v Speaker 1>white evangelicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is that a version of Christianity</v>

29
00:02:01.431 --> 00:02:05.570
<v Speaker 1>preached by these charlatans like Joel</v>
<v Speaker 1>Olsteen and td Jakes,</v>

30
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.160
<v Speaker 1>the essential just of which is that God</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants you to drive a Bentley.</v>

31
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>That what Jesus really wants for you is</v>
<v Speaker 1>material prosperity.</v>

32
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.070
<v Speaker 1>And indeed that's how you know God has</v>
<v Speaker 1>blessed you is by your material</v>

33
00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:19.970
<v Speaker 1>prosperity.</v>

34
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Many white evangelicals looked at Donald</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump,</v>

35
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.370
<v Speaker 1>and what they saw was a wealthy man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that wealth,</v>

36
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.670
<v Speaker 1>as far as they were concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just a sign of God's blessings.</v>

37
00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:36.170
<v Speaker 1>And so that freed trump from having to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do what every other candidate,</v>

38
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.310
<v Speaker 1>certainly every other Republican</v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate for president has had to do.</v>

39
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:43.420
<v Speaker 1>And that is actually prove his spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>bond.</v>

40
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Bonafides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump never had to do that.</v>

41
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.890
<v Speaker 1>All he had to do was just keep talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how rich he was.</v>

42
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.830
<v Speaker 1>And for a large swath of white</v>
<v Speaker 1>evangelicals,</v>

43
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 1>that was enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirdly,</v>

44
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump did something that no other</v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

45
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>not even any Republican president</v>
<v Speaker 1>cording the event evangelical vote ever</v>

46
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Express Lee promised secular power to</v>

47
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>these white evangelical groups in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches to them.</v>

48
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:12.721
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

49
00:03:12.721 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 1>and the conferences that he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both private and public,</v>

50
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.210
<v Speaker 1>he very clearly and very explicitly said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if they voted for him,</v>

51
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>that he would give them their power</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

52
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if he didn't agree with their pet</v>

53
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>causes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he would just allow them,</v>

54
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have those causes.</v>

55
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>And you can see as president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 1>he's talking now about removing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>instance,</v>

57
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:42.451
<v Speaker 1>than Johnson Amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an amendment that prohibits a</v>

58
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.420
<v Speaker 1>preachers and churches from actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging directly in politics,</v>

59
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and preaching politics from the pulpit.</v>

60
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 1>It's why they get to keep their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their tax break.</v>

61
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one has ever thought about,</v>

62
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>removing this requirement until Donald</v>

63
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now he is very seriously,</v>

64
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving towards allowing churches to take</v>

65
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:10.640
<v Speaker 1>part directly in political activism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

66
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 1>as churches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But none of this,</v>

67
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.710
<v Speaker 1>none of this explains the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon about white evangelicals in</v>

68
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is this in the span of a single</v>

69
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 1>election cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white evangelicals have gone from being</v>

70
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.590
<v Speaker 1>the group in America that is most likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say that a politician's morality</v>

71
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:41.581
<v Speaker 1>matters to the group that is now least</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to say that atheists and America</v>

72
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.590
<v Speaker 1>think that a politician's morality</v>
<v Speaker 1>matters more than white evangelicals in</v>

73
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:51.310
<v Speaker 1>America do.</v>

74
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 1>White evangelicals who continue to refer</v>
<v Speaker 1>to themselves as value voters.</v>

75
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.620
<v Speaker 1>This is a phenomenon that can't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>explained by just looking at the</v>

76
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Prosperity Gospel or looking at racial</v>
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

77
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.930
<v Speaker 1>What you're seeing is a gigantic group</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Americans who are fundamentally</v>

78
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:17.701
<v Speaker 1>overturning their core theological</v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs that public morality matters.</v>

79
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.200
<v Speaker 1>And the only explanation that I have for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that Donald Trump has turned a</v>

80
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:30.910
<v Speaker 1>large swath of white evangelical</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity into a cult,</v>

81
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 1>into a religious cult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dangerous religious cult.</v>

82
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.990
<v Speaker 1>All the signs are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

83
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump functions as he himself</v>

84
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.080
<v Speaker 1>admitted when he said offhandedly that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could shoot someone on fifth avenue</v>

85
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 1>and not lose voters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has become a kind of a prophetic</v>

86
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:52.960
<v Speaker 1>divine character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pat Robertson,</v>

87
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.460
<v Speaker 1>the head of the 700 club of very</v>
<v Speaker 1>influential white evangelical,</v>

88
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.800
<v Speaker 1>literally said that God took him in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream up to heaven.</v>

89
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 1>And he saw Donald Trump sitting at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right hand of God.</v>

90
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who actually sits at the right hand of</v>

91
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 1>God according to Evangelicals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

92
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pat Robertson is saying that Donald</v>

93
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Trump is essentially Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that's not that weird.</v>

94
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>His Own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.560
<v Speaker 1>evangelical advisor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.430
<v Speaker 1>a pastor by the name of Jeffers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

97
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.610
<v Speaker 1>said not too long ago that he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>prefer Donald Trump as a candidate over</v>

98
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:39.161
<v Speaker 1>someone who quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she expresses the values of Jesus.</v>

99
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.220
<v Speaker 1>So what we are seeing now is that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>white evangelicals,</v>

100
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:46.970
<v Speaker 1>not all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a,</v>

101
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.030
<v Speaker 1>but a fundamental core of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have essentially latched onto Donald</v>

102
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump as almost a salvific</v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

103
00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 1>They don't just follow him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't just agree with him.</v>

104
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:06.010
<v Speaker 1>They almost worship him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my fear is that as we know from our</v>

105
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:11.360
<v Speaker 1>very recent history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

106
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 1>colts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when confronted with the realities of</v>

107
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:21.401
<v Speaker 1>the world can often and in catastrophic</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

108
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 1>we have a presidency that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>deteriorating,</v>

109
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.130
<v Speaker 1>a president that is spiraling out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

110
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.260
<v Speaker 1>We have open conversations now about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>25th amendment and impeachment.</v>

111
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.620
<v Speaker 1>We have multiple investigations and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of indictments at the</v>

112
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:44.321
<v Speaker 1>highest level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a presidency that is in danger</v>

113
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:49.420
<v Speaker 1>of completely disintegrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't be such a big deal if it</v>

114
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:55.421
<v Speaker 1>weren't also a religious cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when a religious cult begins to</v>

115
00:07:55.881 --> 00:08:00.881
<v Speaker 1>deal with this kind of situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're cosmic ideas are,</v>

116
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.590
<v Speaker 1>are suddenly butting up against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>
