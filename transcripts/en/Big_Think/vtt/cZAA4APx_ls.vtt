00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Putting issues on the cable</v>

2
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.330
<v Speaker 2>so that we have to understand the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural mindset.</v>

3
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.300
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's far more in common.</v>

4
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Then there is indifference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in Asia,</v>

5
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.630
<v Speaker 2>in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other parts of Asia,</v>

6
00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:24.631
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saving face is fundamentally a process.</v>

7
00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:28.690
<v Speaker 2>You simply don't rip the face off of</v>
<v Speaker 2>another person.</v>

8
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.920
<v Speaker 2>You don't also open so much yourself in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning because you don't want to</v>

9
00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Speaker 2>lose face yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it takes longer to build those bonds.</v>

10
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.340
<v Speaker 2>And if you're the same way in the Middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>East,</v>

11
00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:43.570
<v Speaker 2>if you go to the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot go to was sued and buy</v>

12
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.120
<v Speaker 2>something without sitting inhabiting a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tea.</v>

13
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.090
<v Speaker 2>If it's a significant purchase in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>west,</v>

14
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:52.900
<v Speaker 2>we tend to be more direct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your bottom line?</v>

15
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.070
<v Speaker 2>You go right to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

16
00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 2>which are fundamental mistake.</v>
