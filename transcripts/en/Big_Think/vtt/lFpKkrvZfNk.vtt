1
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.910
<v Speaker 1>So what humans do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that specialist,</v>

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.930
<v Speaker 1>we absorb all of these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these inputs and we switched them up</v>

3
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 1>in various ways and come up with new</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

4
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:19.611
<v Speaker 1>And so there are essentially three main</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that the brain does this and we've</v>

5
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 1>summarize this as bending and breaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and blending.</v>

6
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.410
<v Speaker 1>So let's start with bending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bending is where you take something and</v>

7
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you change it,</v>

8
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 1>you make it smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make it bigger,</v>

9
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>you change something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at statues across human</v>

10
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:39.860
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find that that um,</v>

11
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>people bend the human form any which</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

12
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>making it taller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skinnier,</v>

13
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>emphasizing certain portions over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

14
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>They do that with all animal paintings</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sculptures and so on.</v>

15
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 1>You can bend lots of aspects of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the artist Jr made a statue of the</v>

16
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>high jumper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed Idris,</v>

17
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Olympics and he put that super</v>

18
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>huge and had him jumping over a</v>
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

19
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>And you have other sculptors that make</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely tiny little figurines.</v>

20
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>And one of the arguments we make is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exact same thing that's happening in</v>

21
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 1>art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same cognitive processes are</v>

22
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>happening in the sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

23
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>so you see exactly this kind of thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening all the time.</v>

24
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Just as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the early days of driving in the</v>

25
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:24.870
<v Speaker 1>1920s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>headlight glare was a real problem.</v>

26
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.860
<v Speaker 1>So Edwin land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>the scientist realized that he could</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve this by using polarizing crystals,</v>

28
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:35.910
<v Speaker 1>but those were very big at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he figured out how to shrink these</v>

29
00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>down and make a windshield out of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these little polarized crystals.</v>

30
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same sort of Aha moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the artist who's making these tiny</v>

31
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:47.880
<v Speaker 1>figurines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same kind of bend going on.</v>

32
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>And we see this all over in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in biology.</v>

33
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Just as one example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the artificial heart,</v>

34
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since it was invented in the 1980s has</v>

35
00:01:57.091 --> 00:02:00.510
<v Speaker 1>been a mechanical pump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these are very energy hungry and</v>

36
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 1>they get worn down.</v>

37
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>And so in 2004,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of physicians came up with a</v>

38
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:11.631
<v Speaker 1>continuous flow heart where blood flows</v>
<v Speaker 1>through and is oxygenated continuously.</v>

39
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 1>So if you have one of these hearts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a pulse at all.</v>

40
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Dick Cheney has one of these and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a pulse.</v>

41
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.220
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>this is a bend of what we find in</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

43
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>We get the idea of the heart and then we</v>
<v Speaker 1>bend it to make it compatible with what</v>

44
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:28.620
<v Speaker 1>we want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course the airplanes are,</v>

45
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.470
<v Speaker 1>are a bend of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.510
<v Speaker 1>what we witnessed birds doing and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are many ways that you can bend</v>

47
00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>things and this is one of the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that the brain does all the time.</v>

48
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.240
<v Speaker 1>So breaking is where you take some</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

49
00:02:43.241 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>some input that you've received and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>busted into pieces,</v>

50
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:49.110
<v Speaker 1>maybe leave pieces out or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

51
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.240
<v Speaker 1>So just as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

52
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>the artist cory archangel took the video</v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

53
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Super Mario Brothers and he hacked into</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and he removed everything except for</v>

54
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 1>the little clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he made an art installation</v>

55
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>where it was just the clouds and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>called it Super Mario Clouds.</v>

56
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>What he was doing was taking part of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

57
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>leaving part of it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That same kind of overt creativity that</v>

58
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>happens in the arts is exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens in the scientific lab all the</v>

59
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>time where you take certain parts away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

60
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>in my field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a method that's used now in</v>

61
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:25.230
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience called clarity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you take the,</v>

62
00:03:25.231 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can't see inside of,</v>

63
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>and you wash away all the fatty</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules so that you can see where the</v>

64
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>pathways originate and where they go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that way you can essentially make</v>

65
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 1>part of the brain transparent.</v>

66
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 1>You can suddenly see the pathways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the exact same idea.</v>

67
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Just as another example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

68
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.310
<v Speaker 1>the artist David Hockney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>takes the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the visual field and breaks it up into</v>

70
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:52.040
<v Speaker 1>pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the impressionist painters,</v>

71
00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Surat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

72
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.240
<v Speaker 1>does pointillism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

73
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>there's these sort of big dots and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing these dots.</v>

74
00:03:58.031 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 1>If you come up close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see them.</v>

75
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:00.860
<v Speaker 1>If you go far away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a,</v>

76
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 1>a painting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this exact same sort of breaking is</v>

77
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>the innovation that underlies our whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>digital universe because there's</v>

78
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:11.350
<v Speaker 1>pixelation of everything you see on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer screen.</v>

79
00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a bunch of individual squares that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have different colors.</v>

80
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>And at the right distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see me talking on a big think video.</v>

81
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Fred sanger was trying to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sequence long molecules of DNA.</v>

82
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>And he realized that he could break</v>
<v Speaker 1>these up into smaller pieces and then</v>

83
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 1>you can analyze and correlate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

84
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 1>He actually ended up winning two Nobel</v>
<v Speaker 1>prizes for this work that he did,</v>

85
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 1>and it's the basis of essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything we know about genomes at this</v>

86
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all the same cognitive</v>

87
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 1>operations that are happening that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see both in the art and in the sciences.</v>

88
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.370
<v Speaker 1>What happens in the arts is overt</v>
<v Speaker 1>bending,</v>

89
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 1>breaking and blending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see all kinds of art projects</v>

90
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:59.200
<v Speaker 1>where people are taking things in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're bending them and in size or</v>

91
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:02.410
<v Speaker 1>texture or they're breaking them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're breaking pieces off or they're</v>

92
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:06.130
<v Speaker 1>blending two ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the basis of all of the art that</v>

93
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:11.131
<v Speaker 1>we see exactly the same mechanisms are</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in the scientific lab.</v>

94
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 1>It's just that typically we can't see</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

95
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 1>So when you pick up your cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this little rectangle that is</v>

96
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:22.021
<v Speaker 1>absolutely chock full of creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of really brilliant ideas that went into</v>

97
00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:23.710
<v Speaker 1>the making of that.</v>

98
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.920
<v Speaker 1>But you can't see it because it's just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>

99
00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:27.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enclosed thing.</v>

100
00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:31.300
<v Speaker 1>But the interesting part is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly the same cognitive</v>

101
00:05:31.301 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say absorbing the world,</v>

102
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>bending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking and blending it and spinning</v>

103
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:40.600
<v Speaker 1>out new versions of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that we love about our</v>

104
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:45.601
<v Speaker 1>computers is that we can put information</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there and then when we pull it out a</v>

105
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.660
<v Speaker 1>year later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly the same.</v>

106
00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:50.560
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same zeros and ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The human brain doesn't work that way.</v>

107
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 1>When you put stuff in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets switched up with other things</v>

108
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 1>that have come in before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what comes out are,</v>

109
00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new versions of things.</v>

110
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>So blending is where you have two</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely separate ideas and then these</v>

111
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 1>become blended in the brain and</v>
<v Speaker 1>something new comes out.</v>

112
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 1>So just as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

113
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 1>in ancient mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see this all throughout where you</v>

114
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 1>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

115
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:13.300
<v Speaker 1>a man and the why and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

116
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 1>and you got a sphinx or you get all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

117
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 1>different combinations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elian and a goat.</v>

118
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 1>You get a chimera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

119
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same thing happens in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lab.</v>

120
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Just as one example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

121
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.990
<v Speaker 1>scientists have long wanted to harvest</v>
<v Speaker 1>spider silk,</v>

122
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 1>which is actually stronger than steel</v>
<v Speaker 1>for its size,</v>

123
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 1>but you can't get a bunch of spiders</v>
<v Speaker 1>together or they'll eat each other.</v>

124
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:40.871
<v Speaker 1>So what a geneticists did as he spliced</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the gene that makes spider silk and</v>

125
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:46.841
<v Speaker 1>put it in a goat and made freckles the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spider goat who secretes spider silk in</v>

126
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 1>her milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a real life Kymera.</v>

127
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.680
<v Speaker 1>And this idea of taking two separate</v>
<v Speaker 1>things in blending them is something</v>

128
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:55.680
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

129
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.710
<v Speaker 1>humans do all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We take very different concepts and we</v>

130
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.553
<v Speaker 1>put them together.</v>

131
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
