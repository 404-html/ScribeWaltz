1
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.170
<v Speaker 1>In Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to give a general explanation in</v>

2
00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:11.921
<v Speaker 1>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

3
00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:14.420
<v Speaker 1>according to the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to give everything that's</v>

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.040
<v Speaker 1>rewrite about military and intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues to the military censorship.</v>

5
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.690
<v Speaker 1>This book was submitted to military</v>
<v Speaker 1>censorship when it came back,</v>

6
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.560
<v Speaker 1>I counted 750 deletions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a and a tedious negotiation started with</v>

7
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.830
<v Speaker 1>them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we submitted some appears to supreme</v>

8
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.360
<v Speaker 1>court in most cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is the case of an in Israeli</v>

9
00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 1>businessman ex officer with the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hero of the Yom Kippor,</v>

10
00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>October 72,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war who became a businessman and</v>

11
00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:55.261
<v Speaker 1>cynically crudely and viciously sold</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical warfare to Iran.</v>

12
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>The fact that this was not caught by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mozart in time and the whole affair a</v>

13
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>were banned by military censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appeal to Supreme Court and won.</v>

14
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.110
<v Speaker 1>And there's a chapter in a book called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the termite file because the whole</v>

15
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.450
<v Speaker 1>operation was called him the termite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.710
<v Speaker 1>describing the operation.</v>

17
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.040
<v Speaker 1>In some cases we reach compromise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them was very funny.</v>

18
00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I think there was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

19
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a chapter called the second</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming of Hezbollah that starts with an</v>

20
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:27.310
<v Speaker 1>interview with a prominent figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with his Bible in which he says</v>

21
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.260
<v Speaker 1>in 50 years when they opened the secret</v>
<v Speaker 1>files,</v>

22
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>people in Israel would be amazed to how</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor was the human penetration of</v>

23
00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Israeli intelligence into Hezbollah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

24
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 1>when people would read the secret files</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be shocked and sad to see</v>

25
00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:52.690
<v Speaker 1>that Masada looked far less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

26
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.140
<v Speaker 1>like James Bond and far more like</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspector clouseau.</v>

27
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.150
<v Speaker 1>And then he asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know how many real agent did</v>

28
00:02:01.151 --> 00:02:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Israel have in the ranks of Hisbala?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like true ranks,</v>

29
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.950
<v Speaker 1>not in the sympathizers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nordion outside circles his troops,</v>

30
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.520
<v Speaker 1>and he left some fingers of his right</v>
<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>

31
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Now military censorship took everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

32
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>We appealed against it and the outcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a compromise in which they permitted</v>

33
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.250
<v Speaker 1>to publish everything.</v>

34
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.050
<v Speaker 1>And it's in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for the exact number of fingers</v>

35
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.260
<v Speaker 1>that he lifted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you read it,</v>

36
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:37.360
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that it's somewhere between</v>
<v Speaker 1>one and five because it's only his right</v>

37
00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:41.800
<v Speaker 1>arm and fingers were chopped in previous</v>
<v Speaker 1>operations.</v>

38
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no exact number.</v>

39
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.130
<v Speaker 1>I think it's ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet we had to reach some sort of a</v>

40
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.500
<v Speaker 1>compromise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say this,</v>

41
00:02:50.501 --> 00:02:55.501
<v Speaker 1>the bottom line is the 95 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this book is new information and I think</v>

42
00:02:56.411 --> 00:03:00.710
<v Speaker 1>that after all the knowledge of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reader of what's going on in that</v>

43
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 1>clandestine war between Israel and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States and one hand in Iran was</v>

44
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:07.710
<v Speaker 1>not severely damaged by this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of.</v>
