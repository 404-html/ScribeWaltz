1
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>I think that that human kind has been a</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of boots,</v>

2
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.840
<v Speaker 1>a powerful people stamping on people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>faces.</v>

3
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.300
<v Speaker 1>I think that's history and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>different size boots and different</v>

4
00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:27.080
<v Speaker 1>brands and colors and inside that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically history than the enlightenment</v>

5
00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:28.940
<v Speaker 1>comes along and they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enlightenment says,</v>

6
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.340
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's it.</v>

7
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.670
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting if you read somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Machiavelli,</v>

8
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

9
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>whose thoughts about Machiavelli,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it even have to understand that when</v>

10
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:46.100
<v Speaker 1>they use the word freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use it differently than we do.</v>

11
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>For them a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

12
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.490
<v Speaker 1>a state was free in the sense of it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a vassal state,</v>

13
00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:55.310
<v Speaker 1>that prince was not a vassal to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater empire.</v>

14
00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:57.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what freedom meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just taken for granted over</v>

15
00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course the people existed as</v>

16
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.750
<v Speaker 1>instruments of the leaders end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this great watershed moment in</v>

17
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:08.840
<v Speaker 1>humanity is the enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the Scottish enlightenment</v>

18
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.990
<v Speaker 1>where people started realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

19
00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:13.250
<v Speaker 1>we have our own ends.</v>

20
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Speaker 1>We exist as ends in ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the state is just this compact we</v>

21
00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:22.580
<v Speaker 1>form so we can pursue our own ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

22
00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.710
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they control freaks among us,</v>

23
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>hated that and fought the enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when they couldn't defeat it,</v>

24
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.400
<v Speaker 1>they subverted it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the French enlightenment.</v>

25
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.910
<v Speaker 1>That's Russo and they couldn't actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop the progress of the enlightenment.</v>

26
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:39.500
<v Speaker 1>So what they did was they cheapen it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

27
00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:39.781
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

28
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:41.810
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This individual freedom is important,</v>

29
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:43.760
<v Speaker 1>but we have to understand that</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual freedom.</v>

30
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.710
<v Speaker 1>It isn't the silly Scottish English</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of a man deciding his own ends.</v>

31
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.190
<v Speaker 1>It's really this deeper sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjugating yourself to the right</v>

32
00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Speaker 1>historical mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get Russo with his love</v>

33
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.670
<v Speaker 1>orientation around the will of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>general will,</v>

34
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.330
<v Speaker 1>which maybe isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean the majority of will.</v>

35
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:06.590
<v Speaker 1>It's maybe something that only one</v>
<v Speaker 1>person knows.</v>

36
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.500
<v Speaker 1>And when this robespierre forces you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>submit to him,</v>

37
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.390
<v Speaker 1>he's forcing you to be free.</v>

38
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 1>And Russo is phrased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that goes on through Hegel</v>

39
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Marx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the,</v>

40
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.990
<v Speaker 1>it's the trying for the proletariat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Lennon words that vanguard of the</v>

42
00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:25.190
<v Speaker 1>proletariat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the party Hitler,</v>

43
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>where it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

44
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.320
<v Speaker 1>the folk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

45
00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:33.321
<v Speaker 1>the prerogative of the people in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>real freedom is frowned and subordinate</v>

46
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:36.650
<v Speaker 1>yourself to the work of the people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>bike Mark Phi,</v>

47
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.070
<v Speaker 1>as they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the concentration camp gates and</v>

48
00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:43.580
<v Speaker 1>somewhere along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intellectuals from the continent,</v>

49
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I think lost the sense of no freedom is</v>
<v Speaker 1>this basic idea of people choosing their</v>

50
00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:51.770
<v Speaker 1>own ends in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not,</v>

51
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

52
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:53.271
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

53
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:55.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I listened to people talk in</v>

54
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.070
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go right back to this route and it's</v>

55
00:02:58.071 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>pretty easy to say for most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've just taken the wrong fork.</v>

56
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>They are in one way or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defining liberty and freedom as</v>

57
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>subordinating yourself to the ends that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

58
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>that someone else has chosen for you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's a value less.</v>

59
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.420
<v Speaker 1>That is to me the main contention in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world of ideas and political thought.</v>

60
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Somebody get that freedom has to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>self,</v>

61
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.500
<v Speaker 1>a defined process and pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it,</v>

62
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>are they all debating freedom as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We take it for granted that we get to</v>

63
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>subordinate individuals to our ends and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're just going to debate the</v>

64
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.313
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

65
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>that's where most people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where most of the world is,</v>

66
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's a really pernicious</v>
<v Speaker 1>concept.</v>

67
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>voltaire read a book by Rousseau where</v>

68
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he read the stuff,</v>

69
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote us a letter where he said,</v>

70
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>dear Mr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've had the pleasure of reading your</v>

71
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>book against the human race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well had it exactly right.</v>

72
00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 1>This is this philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this continental philosophy from</v>

73
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Rousseau,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kant,</v>

74
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Hegel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a niche,</v>

75
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Marx.</v>

76
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Lenin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

77
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.310
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's anti freedom.</v>

78
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>It's philosophy against the human race.</v>
