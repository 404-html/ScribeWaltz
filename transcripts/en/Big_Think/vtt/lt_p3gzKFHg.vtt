00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm very concerned about the traditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>foods versus imitation foods.</v>

3
00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>I still find people asking me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.300
<v Speaker 1>about soy butter that doesn't contain</v>
<v Speaker 1>trans fats because now they know trans</v>

5
00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 1>fats are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're still asking me about a</v>

6
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>substitute foods and imitations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineered foods and foods with added</v>

7
00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Speaker 1>this or removed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I want them to understand is</v>

8
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:38.650
<v Speaker 1>that the whole traditional foods are</v>
<v Speaker 1>best,</v>

9
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 1>even if they can't afford the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality version of beef or eggs or milk,</v>

10
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>they ought to be consuming beef or eggs</v>
<v Speaker 1>or milk instead of Ersatz foods.</v>

11
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

12
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.820
<v Speaker 1>and I'm also concerned about a plant</v>
<v Speaker 1>based diet for,</v>

13
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for pregnant mothers and for young</v>

14
00:00:57.881 --> 00:00:58.714
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>there is a trend in many urban areas for</v>
<v Speaker 1>young children to be vegetarians and I,</v>

16
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I gather from parents and from</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists that it's the children who</v>

17
00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:11.050
<v Speaker 1>are requesting to be vegetarians.</v>

18
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is presented as charming.</v>

19
00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Once Johnny finds out that I'm the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chicken breast comes from a chicken.</v>

20
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.840
<v Speaker 1>He can't bear to eat his friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chicken.</v>

21
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.900
<v Speaker 1>our son Julian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's three,</v>

23
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helps me take apart chickens regularly.</v>

24
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.390
<v Speaker 1>He completely understands that his</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

25
00:01:28.391 --> 00:01:30.220
<v Speaker 1>the farm animals are also the foods we</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>

26
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.430
<v Speaker 1>We are omnivores and nature created us</v>
<v Speaker 1>as omnivores.</v>

27
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are a lot of things</v>

28
00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:37.780
<v Speaker 1>five-year-olds might want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might want junk and they might want</v>

29
00:01:37.781 --> 00:01:39.040
<v Speaker 1>junk television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:42.460
<v Speaker 1>they might want to be vegetarians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a good time for a person to</v>

31
00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:46.340
<v Speaker 1>be a vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If in adulthood you've been well fed 'em</v>

32
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.470
<v Speaker 1>in your mother's womb and at her breast</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in your growing years,</v>

33
00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 1>you want to experiment with a high</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality vegetarian diet or even have a</v>

34
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.990
<v Speaker 1>very carefully planned Vegan Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's acceptable,</v>

35
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's right for children to</v>

36
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:04.270
<v Speaker 1>be raised as vegetarians even if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask.</v>

37
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>The good news also is that there now I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethically sound and ecologically sound</v>

38
00:02:10.991 --> 00:02:13.630
<v Speaker 1>ways to be an omnivore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would urge you,</v>

39
00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:17.020
<v Speaker 1>if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are conscientious about these</v>

40
00:02:17.021 --> 00:02:21.250
<v Speaker 1>matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find the farmers who care for animals</v>

41
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.270
<v Speaker 1>and care for plants and care for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment and shop from them.</v>
