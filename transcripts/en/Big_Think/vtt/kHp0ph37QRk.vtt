00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.420
<v Speaker 1>So your question is how widespread is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a NASA that scientists are</v>

2
00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:19.780
<v Speaker 1>convinced that human activity is</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for climate change and this</v>

3
00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:21.280
<v Speaker 1>is something that's important to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

4
00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:24.430
<v Speaker 1>very clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have known and worked with hundreds of</v>

5
00:00:24.431 --> 00:00:27.190
<v Speaker 1>earth scientists at many different</v>
<v Speaker 1>locations in NASA.</v>

6
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.390
<v Speaker 1>All of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them believe that human activity</v>

7
00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:35.290
<v Speaker 1>is responsible for the current climate</v>
<v Speaker 1>change that we see going so fast.</v>

8
00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:37.930
<v Speaker 1>It's almost unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to think about that.</v>

9
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.490
<v Speaker 1>One thing that I take really seriously</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm very proud of is that NASA is</v>

10
00:00:42.491 --> 00:00:45.880
<v Speaker 1>not a political organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are scientists that work for the</v>

11
00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:48.340
<v Speaker 1>American people were funded by taxpayer</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

12
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.580
<v Speaker 1>and what we do is we make measurements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have many,</v>

13
00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:54.490
<v Speaker 1>many different satellites that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>orbiting the earth right now.</v>

14
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.880
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at things like ice on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oceans at the polls.</v>

15
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.880
<v Speaker 1>They're looking for things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetation growth and the change of that</v>

16
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.430
<v Speaker 1>ocean level is the ocean level rising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Turns out that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have many scientists all over the</v>

18
00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>planet studying all of the different</v>
<v Speaker 1>ramifications of climate change.</v>

19
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.350
<v Speaker 1>We understand the causes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There actually is no scientific</v>

20
00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:18.700
<v Speaker 1>controversy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans are releasing greenhouse gases</v>

21
00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:21.010
<v Speaker 1>into the atmosphere and this is warming</v>
<v Speaker 1>our planet.</v>

22
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what scientists are researching</v>

23
00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:26.680
<v Speaker 1>currently and they don't all agree about</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what are the most important</v>

24
00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:29.890
<v Speaker 1>components of driving climate change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it carbon dioxide?</v>

25
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.770
<v Speaker 1>It could it be something else like</v>
<v Speaker 1>methane and methane gets released.</v>

26
00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:34.930
<v Speaker 1>That's an even more powerful greenhouse</v>
<v Speaker 1>gas.</v>

27
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.980
<v Speaker 1>We don't agree on how quickly things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the ocean level will rise.</v>

28
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.650
<v Speaker 1>People have different estimates for how</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly that will happen,</v>

29
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.870
<v Speaker 1>so there still is scientific controversy</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what the most important aspects of</v>

30
00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:49.810
<v Speaker 1>climate change are and how quickly it</v>
<v Speaker 1>will go in the future,</v>

31
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.550
<v Speaker 1>but there is no scientific disagreement</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a NASA that humans are causing</v>

32
00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:55.384
<v Speaker 1>climate change.</v>

33
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started this off by saying that one of</v>

34
00:01:57.491 --> 00:02:01.060
<v Speaker 1>the things I'm very proud of is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>NASA is not political and what that</v>

35
00:02:01.061 --> 00:02:05.320
<v Speaker 1>means for me is that I cannot advocate</v>
<v Speaker 1>for any specific solution to climate</v>

36
00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:06.730
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not my job.</v>

37
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.300
<v Speaker 1>That's up to policymakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people might suggest things like</v>

38
00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:13.510
<v Speaker 1>having more solar energy or cutting</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon emissions or things like that,</v>

39
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.740
<v Speaker 1>but at Nasa we really understand that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not us.</v>

40
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.370
<v Speaker 1>That's up to the American people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders and leaders around the world.</v>

41
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.520
<v Speaker 1>What we do is provide the facts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody on the planet.</v>

42
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.910
<v Speaker 1>All of our data is actually free to any</v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

43
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:30.430
<v Speaker 1>any person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any scientists all over the world that</v>

44
00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:33.580
<v Speaker 1>wants to use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we all know what's causing climate</v>

45
00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:36.040
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't tell you what to do about it,</v>

46
00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:38.830
<v Speaker 1>but we can say it's time to do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
