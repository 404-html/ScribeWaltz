00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that every manager in the</v>

2
00:00:11.421 --> 00:00:14.060
<v Speaker 1>world who's a Buddhist is necessarily a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good manager.</v>

3
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.270
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain elements of Buddhism I</v>

4
00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:22.271
<v Speaker 1>think are very positive for management,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially now such as let go of the</v>

5
00:00:22.911 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 1>past and if you look at coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a study done on coaches and</v>

6
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Buddha believed that anyone can change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what the study showed?</v>

7
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Coaches who believe people can change</v>
<v Speaker 1>are much more effective than those who</v>

8
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:38.120
<v Speaker 1>do not believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can change the well.</v>

9
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Amazingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't believe other people</v>

10
00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:43.580
<v Speaker 1>can change other pretty useless as</v>
<v Speaker 1>coaches.</v>

11
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.520
<v Speaker 1>So I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>my Buddhist philosophy is a simple one.</v>

12
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:51.521
<v Speaker 1>It basically involves let go of the past</v>
<v Speaker 1>except what is move forward.</v>

13
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Make the best of what you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Happy and content.</v>
