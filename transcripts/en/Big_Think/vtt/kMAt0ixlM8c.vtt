1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.540
<v Speaker 2>double take magazine once printed a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little pamphlet,</v>

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 2>which I listed 10 different things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should,</v>

4
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 2>you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember all of them,</v>

5
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:20.790
<v Speaker 2>but the first one was turned off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>television set.</v>

6
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can read poetry while you're</v>

7
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:28.491
<v Speaker 2>watching television very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of how to read a poem is based</v>

8
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 2>on the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

9
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 2>that poetry needs you as a reader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the experience of poetry,</v>

10
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 2>meaning and poetry is a kind of circuit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that takes place between a poet,</v>

11
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 2>a poem and a reader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that meaning doesn't exist,</v>

12
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 2>or inherent poems alone that readers</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring their own experiences,</v>

13
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 2>their own range of their own wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own knowledge,</v>

14
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 2>their own insights to poems and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning of a poem takes place in the</v>

15
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 2>negotiation between the poet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poem and the reader.</v>

16
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 2>And then as a reader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a task to do.</v>

17
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.340
<v Speaker 2>You have something to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You bring your experience to it.</v>

18
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not all inherent in the poem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

19
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 2>the great Holocaust post-holocaust poet</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Salon,</v>

20
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 2>said that a poem is a message in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottle sent out in the not always</v>

21
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:25.851
<v Speaker 2>greatly hopeful belief that somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometime it would wash up on land on</v>

22
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:30.240
<v Speaker 2>heartland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps the idea of a poem is a message</v>

23
00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 2>in a bottle means that it's sent out</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards some future reader.</v>

24
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 2>And the reader who opens that bottle</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes the address.</v>

25
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 2>See of the literary Text Salon was</v>
<v Speaker 2>picking up something that the Russian</v>

26
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 2>poet Osap Manuel Stem had written in</v>
<v Speaker 2>1916 called on the address.</v>

27
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 2>See.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Mondo stomp says a poet,</v>

28
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 2>you go down to the shore and you see an</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlikely looking from a bottle from the</v>

29
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You open it,</v>

30
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 2>model stem says it's okay to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not reading someone else's mail.</v>

31
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 2>It was addressed to ever found it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found it,</v>

32
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 2>therefore it's addressed to me and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you find it,</v>

33
00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 2>you become the secret address.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See of a literary text.</v>

34
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 2>And I felt that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

35
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 2>the reader had been left out of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience of reading poetry or what</v>

36
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 2>rate or what the experience of poetry</v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

37
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.360
<v Speaker 2>And so my focus is on the reader and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the poets job is not to inspire</v>

38
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 2>himself or herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Post job is to inspire some future</v>

39
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 2>reader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so as a reader,</v>

40
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 2>you have a task to do in finding those</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottles and opening up the messages and</v>

41
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:38.730
<v Speaker 2>experiencing what's in them inside of</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

42
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.620
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a connection that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>only hope for.</v>

43
00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 2>It's not something that you can make</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it does,</v>

44
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it needs someone else.</v>

45
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find in,</v>

46
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.270
<v Speaker 2>in Walt Whitman and an American</v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition,</v>

47
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 2>a certain kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say desperate American</v>

48
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.730
<v Speaker 2>in which you reach out</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which the poet tries to reach out</v>

49
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 2>through the page to make a connection by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the side of the road with some other</v>

50
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But ultimately that's,</v>

51
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 2>that's a longing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a completion that has to be made by</v>

52
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 2>other readers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see clarity,</v>

53
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 2>you can seek warmth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can try to make something for</v>

54
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 2>lasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can pick something in salt so that</v>

55
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 2>it's well made and you can hope that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out last time.</v>

56
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 2>But ultimately that's not up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately,</v>

57
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to reach across and find</v>
<v Speaker 2>some other person,</v>

58
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 2>some other human warmth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is,</v>

59
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 2>especially in written poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is inscribed and attacks and the text</v>

60
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 2>can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Work by itself and you as a poet can</v>

61
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 2>only do your best.</v>
