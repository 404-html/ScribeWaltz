<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Percy.</v>

3
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.910
<v Speaker 2>We appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We understand that.</v>

4
00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:15.290
<v Speaker 2>We know they publish that after you die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>

5
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.990
<v Speaker 2>we got the memo</v>

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.520
<v Speaker 1>by poets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't talking about versify or do</v>

7
00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:23.790
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't talking about folk who write</v>

8
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>words on a page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about all human beings</v>

9
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>who mustard imagination and empathy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceive of an alternative reality given</v>

10
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>the nightmares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic driven realities.</v>

11
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Most of us have to come to terms with</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means to live a life of a certain</v>

12
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:42.681
<v Speaker 1>kind is to be a poet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an artist of life and artists of living.</v>

13
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>One Who through ones deeds and actions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and witness exemplifies and imagination</v>

14
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>and an empathy that is subversive in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of relating to the past which just</v>

15
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:58.830
<v Speaker 1>has four to two and courageous in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>present to pass on to the next</v>

16
00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some wind at their back.</v>

17
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.080
<v Speaker 1>If you're wanting to know what hope he</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

18
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Just zoom in and August of 1955 within</v>
<v Speaker 1>materials.</v>

19
00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she's asked to speak before,</v>

20
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:19.211
<v Speaker 1>not just public but the whole world</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the cameras were there from all</v>

21
00:01:19.281 --> 00:01:24.200
<v Speaker 1>the various nations and there's her baby</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the coffin with the coffin open.</v>

22
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>They tried to make sure they kept a</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffin closed.</v>

23
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:27.564
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

24
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.730
<v Speaker 1>they're going to keep it open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just fetched his body from the</v>

25
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Tallahatchie River in Jim Crow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gut bucket,</v>

26
00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Mississippi Keel by cowardly hateful</v>
<v Speaker 1>American terrorists,</v>

27
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 2>white supremacists.</v>

28
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.060
<v Speaker 1>We going to keep it open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my only baby.</v>

29
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.360
<v Speaker 1>What you got to say Mamie till to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

30
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not speaking on behalf of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>

31
00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not speaking on behalf of black</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are America.</v>

32
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking on behalf of the bests of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the humans</v>

33
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 2>bcs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what I don't have a minute to</v>

34
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:01.440
<v Speaker 2>hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will pursue justice for the rest of my</v>

35
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's been a hope.</v>

36
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 2>It's an echo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that magnificent moment and Ryan home</v>

37
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 2>neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1932 classic more men in the moral</v>

38
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 2>society where Ryan Hall says any</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice.</v>

39
00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:21.591
<v Speaker 2>There's only justice soon degenerate</v>
<v Speaker 2>into something less than justice.</v>

40
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Justice must be rescued by something</v>
<v Speaker 2>grander and deeper than justice.</v>

41
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.090
<v Speaker 2>Mainly love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>

42
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.160
<v Speaker 2>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not identical,</v>

43
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.640
<v Speaker 2>but in the visible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Martin says,</v>

44
00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:39.640
<v Speaker 2>justice is what love looks like in</v>
<v Speaker 2>public,</v>

45
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.050
<v Speaker 2>he's talking about it in the legacy of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jerusalem,</v>

46
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.350
<v Speaker 2>not the legacy of Athens for Plato.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Justice as a norm</v>

47
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.120
<v Speaker 2>to giving and having ones do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but an Amos justice is a force,</v>

48
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.360
<v Speaker 2>is a major force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an answer to the question of Walter</v>

49
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Hawkins and his song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

50
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.120
<v Speaker 2>How do I count for this fire I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of me that want to give me any</v>

51
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:17.314
<v Speaker 2>piece?</v>

52
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.860
<v Speaker 2>I've got to somehow get it out and if I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do something to rock,</v>

53
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 2>so going to cry out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's as substantial.</v>

54
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even call it spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we know religious folk have no</v>

55
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 2>monopoly on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Given the history of religious</v>

56
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 2>institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accommodating themselves to the most</v>

57
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 2>vicious phones have beastiality and</v>
<v Speaker 2>atrocity be against our Jewish brothers</v>

58
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 2>and sisters in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity.</v>

59
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.570
<v Speaker 2>It could be against Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be against everything because</v>

60
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.980
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gazing levels of black folk or</v>

61
00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:52.690
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank God for the history of the</v>

62
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:57.691
<v Speaker 2>heretics and the blast famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my crowd.</v>

63
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Look at the history of communism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My God,</v>

64
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.140
<v Speaker 2>every self conscious Marxists finds him</v>
<v Speaker 2>or herself usually having to leave the</v>

65
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 2>communist party in order to be true to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best of Karl Marx.</v>

66
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.700
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of the ossification and a pet to</v>

67
00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 2>vacation of institutions in that way.</v>

68
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Hope is that substantial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep coming back to that point.</v>

69
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.730
<v Speaker 2>And the issue of integrity that the boys</v>
<v Speaker 2>raised is quintessential.</v>

70
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.290
<v Speaker 2>And of course we live in an age of what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cupidity love of money.</v>

71
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.230
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say stupidity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's too easy.</v>

72
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 2>Even though that's part of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's cupidity</v>

73
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.080
<v Speaker 2>cause it wouldn't be a Donald Trump if</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't for Wall Street corporate.</v>

74
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 2>He leads the Republican Party that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>so complicitness and willing to adjust</v>

75
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:55.360
<v Speaker 2>themselves to it or even a democratic</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of this too.</v>

76
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Milk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>toast and acts like they want to be part</v>

77
00:04:57.231 --> 00:05:02.231
<v Speaker 2>of the resistance but usually have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought in kicking and screaming because</v>

78
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:04.180
<v Speaker 2>the Deimos wake up and just hit the</v>
<v Speaker 2>streets.</v>

79
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.730
<v Speaker 2>The way the system is did the day after</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inauguration night,</v>

80
00:05:07.731 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 2>it hit hit the airports the way our</v>
<v Speaker 2>precious brothers and sisters in</v>

81
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:17.011
<v Speaker 2>solidarity with and following,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so call undocumented brothers and</v>

82
00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:22.351
<v Speaker 2>sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all those little ones we've been in</v>

83
00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 2>the vanguard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the poets,</v>

84
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.530
<v Speaker 2>the artists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the van guard of the species.</v>

85
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Integrity over against cupidity and</v>
<v Speaker 2>venality and the saddest feature of our</v>

86
00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 2>present moment and that's why you all</v>
<v Speaker 2>were so visionary because you all came</v>

87
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 2>up with this day and age of Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see for a lot of people,</v>

88
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:49.420
<v Speaker 2>they didn't need to talk about hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Obama because Obama has already</v>

89
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 2>provided in the hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

90
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.060
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get that memo.</v>

91
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 1>That's another lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to get into that</v>

92
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:57.900
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

93
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.180
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

94
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm suspicious of anybody tagged the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wall of speak military industrial</v>

95
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 1>complex assassinating American citizens</v>
<v Speaker 1>without accountability.</v>

96
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm critical of antibody antibody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top 1% getting 95% of the income</v>

97
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.940
<v Speaker 1>growth and 94% of the job that you brag</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a short term contemporary,</v>

98
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 1>temporary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>precarious jobs that somehow you're</v>

99
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:27.010
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about the low unemployment</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate.</v>

100
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just take a look at these</v>
<v Speaker 1>brushes folk in these communities</v>

101
00:06:30.851 --> 00:06:34.090
<v Speaker 1>dealing with these two or three jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to put it all together.</v>

102
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Start with the university with adjunct</v>
<v Speaker 1>professors.</v>

<v Speaker 1>status quo is and therefore death.</v>

104
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you hope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's another lecture.</v>

105
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.070
<v Speaker 1>My point is this.</v>

106
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.273
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

107

<v Speaker 2>that everybody's for sale.</v>

108
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.790
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Your glucose was right.</v>

110
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Pervasive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ubiquitous commodification tied to</v>

111
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.320
<v Speaker 2>militarization in our relations with one</v>
<v Speaker 2>another and the relations with police</v>

112

114
00:07:25.141 --> 00:07:30.141

115
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:36.190
<v Speaker 2>relation to the West Bank under Israeli</v>
<v Speaker 2>occupation in relation to poor doers,</v>

116
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:42.230
<v Speaker 2>folk inside of Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given the increasing wealth inequality</v>

117
00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:47.231
<v Speaker 2>within Israel itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>commodification,</v>
