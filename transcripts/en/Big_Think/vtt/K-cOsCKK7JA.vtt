00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly I think religious forces have</v>

2
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 1>had a huge impact and continue to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>

3
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a particular religion or a</v>

4
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>profit or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.770
<v Speaker 1>certainly we wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be here in the United States</v>

6
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:32.200
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>our forefathers hadn't been concerned</v>
<v Speaker 1>about religious persecution in Europe at</v>

8
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

9
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pilgrims came over to Plymouth rock.</v>

10
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't see the same divisions if we</v>

11
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>hadn't had the crusades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

12
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been something that has</v>

13
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.120
<v Speaker 1>influenced us through the centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it is to make things better,</v>

14
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 1>to try and make the world a better place</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the people who live here.</v>
