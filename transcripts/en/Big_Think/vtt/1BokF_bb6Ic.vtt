1
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.580
<v Speaker 1>There's two different sorts of frauds as</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand it,</v>

2
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.930
<v Speaker 1>to a fraud or corruption of just a lump </v>
<v Speaker 1>them together.</v>

3
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.540
<v Speaker 1>But you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got theft corruption in it.</v>

4
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Just to give you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:20.080
<v Speaker 1>could have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.570
<v Speaker 1>an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

7
00:00:22.571 --> 00:00:23.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

8
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.493
<v Speaker 1>I'm not looking to be insulting to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the various developing world </v>

9
00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:28.294
<v Speaker 1>governments and to say that they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>fraudulent and everybody there was </v>

10
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:31.844
<v Speaker 1>fraudulent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're clearly not in some very honest </v>

11
00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:35.110
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good people over there.</v>

12
00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:37.240
<v Speaker 1>But some of the challenges become that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:40.600
<v Speaker 1>when the minister of finance transfers </v>
<v Speaker 1>the money to the Ministry of Education,</v>

14
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are occasions where some of the </v>

15
00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:43.444
<v Speaker 1>money and it goes the administer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>education convinced that check into </v>

16
00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:47.914
<v Speaker 1>cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cash now's got to get distributed </v>

17
00:00:50.021 --> 00:00:52.360
<v Speaker 1>to the districts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the districts,</v>

18
00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:56.410
<v Speaker 1>I've got to then distribute the cash to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the local parishes,</v>

19
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>then the parishes.</v>

20
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.013
<v Speaker 1>I've got to distribute it to the school </v>
<v Speaker 1>masters and to the principals in the </v>

21
00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:01.264
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine how there could be </v>

22
00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:07.720
<v Speaker 1>situations where some people along that </v>
<v Speaker 1>chain of the cash take their time.</v>

23
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.921
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:08.921 --> 00:01:09.754
<v Speaker 1>along the way and when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so by the time the people that the who </v>

25
00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:15.100
<v Speaker 1>are supposed to receive the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

26
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.180
<v Speaker 1>their salary that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>the hundred percent of the cash that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a given upfront to the ministry,</v>

28
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.920
<v Speaker 1>there's only 80% left by the time it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets to the teacher at the bottom end.</v>

29
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.903
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the sorts of situations that </v>

30
00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:32.830
<v Speaker 1>have been described to me as being very </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical.</v>

31
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

32
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.460
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't always happen in every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

33
00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:38.230
<v Speaker 1>but clearly these are problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.600
<v Speaker 1>and then when the young woman wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>collect her,</v>

35
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.733
<v Speaker 1>collect her $80 leftover from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred that was originally supposed to </v>

36
00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:45.514
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the,</v>

37
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.393
<v Speaker 1>the person who was supposed to give it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to her very often will abuse the woman </v>

38
00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:52.030
<v Speaker 1>until he actually gives her the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he's got the power over the money.</v>

39
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in addition to that,</v>

40
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.083
<v Speaker 1>there are also many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many ghost employees in the system </v>

41
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.380
<v Speaker 1>because there are no very good checks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and balances.</v>

42
00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:02.410
<v Speaker 1>So that's one element of the corruption </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fraud,</v>

43
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.100
<v Speaker 1>which maps system we'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide a solution for.</v>

44
00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:06.934
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.803
<v Speaker 1>the governments are very keen to underst</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they'll save a lot of money </v>

46
00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:11.620
<v Speaker 1>because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:11.621 --> 00:02:13.330
<v Speaker 1>the people get paid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:13.331 --> 00:02:15.040
<v Speaker 1>kind of directly so that people will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>

49
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:16.990
<v Speaker 1>They'll get paid the amount that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to get paid.</v>

50
00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:19.990
<v Speaker 1>So they'll suddenly start finding that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saving a lot of money.</v>

51
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from there,</v>

52
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.720
<v Speaker 1>the time they send out their $1 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever the number is from the top,</v>

53
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.243
<v Speaker 1>that they'll find that that million </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars when they actually sent it </v>

54
00:02:28.811 --> 00:02:31.360
<v Speaker 1>directly to the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

55
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.650
<v Speaker 1>the people will get the money they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to get for,</v>

56
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:35.740
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a lot of employees that </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't really exist.</v>

57
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.550
<v Speaker 1>So that's one level of corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another level of corruption,</v>

58
00:02:39.551 --> 00:02:42.700
<v Speaker 1>which is that you have to pay people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make things happen.</v>

59
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.830
<v Speaker 1>And I haven't thought it through well </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to see kind of Kemet solution,</v>

60
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come and help out in that situation.</v>

61
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we can solve every </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

62
00:02:53.261 --> 00:02:54.094
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of the corruption and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fraud and the lack of transparency and </v>

63
00:02:57.701 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>the abuse of payments of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>government type payments to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the pensions,</v>

65
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.643
<v Speaker 1>you know that not everybody gets all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pension that they're supposed to get </v>

66
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:08.584
<v Speaker 1>because of the cash distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the sorts of situations that </v>

67
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:17.341
<v Speaker 1>map solution can provide a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a a great benefit to develop.</v>

68
00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>We will government when people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>identified,</v>

69
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.973
<v Speaker 1>they just don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of discussion before </v>

70
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 1>you ask me the next question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the privacy rights?</v>

71
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of of the,</v>

72
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's,</v>

73
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.083
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the governments are going to have so </v>

74
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>much information about the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have their biometrics,</v>

75
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>they'll know that I have the health </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and then they'll have some,</v>

76
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 1>they'll have potentially access to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial information.</v>

77
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.273
<v Speaker 1>Currently these people don't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the government has ultimate power </v>

78
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:45.484
<v Speaker 1>over these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more you enable individuals to </v>

79
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 1>become part of a formal society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more freedom they have,</v>

80
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.313
<v Speaker 1>the more economic success they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody recognizes that economic </v>

81
00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:02.401
<v Speaker 1>success creates an environment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability and peace.</v>

82
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.353
<v Speaker 1>So it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much in the best interests of the </v>

83
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>countries themselves that you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can have stability and peace.</v>

84
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.693
<v Speaker 1>It's in the interest of the developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>world to be able to create an </v>

85
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 1>environment where people are happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People you know,</v>

86
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>kind of ended up that the people exist.</v>

87
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 1>And from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a larger perspective,</v>

88
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.273
<v Speaker 1>today we're dealing in an environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's very limited money </v>

89
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 1>available for an Oda in overseas </v>
<v Speaker 1>development assistance.</v>

90
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.823
<v Speaker 1>So the challenge for the governments is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to find ways to maximize the efficiency </v>

91
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 1>of the money that is being used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that by,</v>

92
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.433
<v Speaker 1>for the donor countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's partnering through the </v>

93
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>World Bank or a USA ID or deferred or </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these agencies,</v>

94
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.293
<v Speaker 1>their ability to identify private sector</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies that will have their own skin </v>

95
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:00.394
<v Speaker 1>in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I've got their own agenda to </v>

96
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:04.600
<v Speaker 1>ensure some longterm sustainability of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the projects,</v>

97
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.733
<v Speaker 1>that there's the ability for these </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies to leverage the donor money </v>

98
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.880
<v Speaker 1>and convert equity to growth and create </v>
<v Speaker 1>an environment where there'll be,</v>

99
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.043
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long term success is the way that </v>

100
00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 1>governments need to be looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

101
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.813
<v Speaker 1>they're developing.</v>
