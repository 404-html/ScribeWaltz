1
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.760
<v Speaker 1>of the changes since nine 11 have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>

3
00:00:15.761 --> 00:00:16.594
<v Speaker 1>I mean an enormous amount of money has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been thrown at the intelligence </v>

4
00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:20.890
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

5
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.520
<v Speaker 1>you went from a period in the 90s where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.443
<v Speaker 1>the peace dividend after the cold war </v>
<v Speaker 1>was in many cases taken at the expense </v>

7
00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:34.801
<v Speaker 1>of the intelligence community and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't much hiring going on and a lot of</v>

8
00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:35.944
<v Speaker 1>early retirements are being forced and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there weren't very many investments and </v>

9
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.403
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really kind of hollowed out after </v>

10
00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:42.640
<v Speaker 1>nine 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive amounts of money were thrown in.</v>

11
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Everybody went on huge hiring sprees and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you,</v>

12
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.793
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't live inside the community but </v>

13
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.350
<v Speaker 1>touring it and bumping up against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I,</v>

14
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.190
<v Speaker 1>my impression is that immediately after </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine 11,</v>

15
00:00:54.191 --> 00:00:55.024
<v Speaker 1>you had an extraordinarily talented </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of young people volunteer to go </v>

16
00:00:58.061 --> 00:00:58.894
<v Speaker 1>into the intelligence beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the best generation of public </v>

17
00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:01.990
<v Speaker 1>servants and went into the government.</v>

18
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the 60s,</v>

19
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.370
<v Speaker 1>people were motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were smart,</v>

20
00:01:06.371 --> 00:01:08.740
<v Speaker 1>they were well educated and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed,</v>

21
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after nine,</v>

22
00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:11.860
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they,</v>

23
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.723
<v Speaker 1>but they went into the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The system really didn't know how to </v>

24
00:01:13.781 --> 00:01:15.940
<v Speaker 1>absorb them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of them bounced out.</v>

25
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.043
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people became disillusioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There weren't a good senior programs or </v>

26
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.343
<v Speaker 1>officers available to mentor them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that sort of wave of </v>

27
00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:32.290
<v Speaker 1>young people as has been atrophied and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not,</v>

28
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

29
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought up to the way,</v>

30
00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:37.414
<v Speaker 1>the way you would win in the meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of their experiences when all these </v>

31
00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:40.624
<v Speaker 1>really great people went in was that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole system kept being reorganized and </v>

32
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:46.600
<v Speaker 1>then reorganized again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the agencies,</v>

33
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:47.434
<v Speaker 1>we're all moving around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think the sense you have from </v>

34
00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:51.214
<v Speaker 1>inside is that there's still a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion about what is a career in </v>

35
00:01:57.731 --> 00:01:58.630
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:03.100
<v Speaker 1>how do you actually have a useful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful and interesting career as a,</v>

37
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 1>as an operative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

38
00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:05.230
<v Speaker 1>analysts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:06.910
<v Speaker 1>there's millions of analysts running </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

40
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.063
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as to the actual collection of </v>

41
00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:11.674
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was what the problem seemed to be </v>

42
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.950
<v Speaker 1>running up to nine 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the system is,</v>

43
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.833
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the system is fixed at </v>

44
00:02:19.511 --> 00:02:20.590
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's still a mess.</v>

45
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

46
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.990
<v Speaker 2>For</v>

47
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.560
<v Speaker 1>private firms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a,</v>

48
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.150
<v Speaker 1>I think that's plain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

49
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:31.984
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that private contractors </v>

50
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>ought to be acting on the battlefield as</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of proxies for or allies of the u s</v>

51
00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:44.050
<v Speaker 1>military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.093
<v Speaker 1>I think private contracting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>logistics and for support and for </v>

53
00:02:47.981 --> 00:02:50.020
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

54
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.100
<v Speaker 1>and maybe for some analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.093
<v Speaker 1>can be part of a governmental system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to have private contractors in the </v>

56
00:02:58.241 --> 00:02:59.074
<v Speaker 1>field tearing out the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of state craft of war or </v>

57
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>shadowy intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a warlike activity,</v>

58
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>paramilitary or collection activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is a mistake.</v>

59
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.263
<v Speaker 2>Pardon?</v>

60
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.571
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

61
00:03:18.571 --> 00:03:19.404
<v Speaker 1>he's a professional who I think was </v>
<v Speaker 1>welcomed there when he was appointed </v>

62
00:03:22.951 --> 00:03:27.030
<v Speaker 1>because the turmoil of the previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>regime had been pretty considerable.</v>

63
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.343
<v Speaker 1>He was a known quantity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was known to be sort of a friend of </v>

64
00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:32.094
<v Speaker 1>the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't there to tear it down or kind of </v>

65
00:03:33.871 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 1>reinvent it the way some other directors</v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

66
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:38.194
<v Speaker 1>had come in wanting to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the basic problem that he faces and </v>

67
00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:43.284
<v Speaker 1>that the agency faces is that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically had been reorganized out of </v>

68
00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:47.754
<v Speaker 1>their prestige and to some extent </v>
<v Speaker 1>reorganized out of their parts of their </v>

69
00:03:51.811 --> 00:03:53.120
<v Speaker 1>mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

70
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.023
<v Speaker 1>they've lost their place at the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their place at the table with the White </v>

71
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.140
<v Speaker 1>House is now taken by the director of </v>
<v Speaker 1>national intelligence,</v>

72
00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:04.890
<v Speaker 1>the new sort of tsar of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence agencies.</v>

73
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.173
<v Speaker 1>And that means the CIA is adjusting to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different world in which it </v>

74
00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:09.450
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

75
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it no longer has direct contact with the</v>

76
00:04:11.641 --> 00:04:13.110
<v Speaker 1>press of the United States every </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

77
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.333
<v Speaker 1>That's what made the CIA the source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this mystique in our political </v>

78
00:04:16.711 --> 00:04:18.180
<v Speaker 1>culture was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:19.560
<v Speaker 1>every morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing,</v>

80
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:21.500
<v Speaker 1>six 30 or 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM the president nodded,</v>

81
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.343
<v Speaker 1>states sits down with the director of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the CIA or his designated briefer and </v>

82
00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:26.304
<v Speaker 1>they talk about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when the president wants something </v>

83
00:04:28.621 --> 00:04:30.970
<v Speaker 1>done off the books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.330
<v Speaker 1>he turns to the CIA and he says </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly,</v>

85
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

86
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.740
<v Speaker 1>I want to raid Cuba or I want to foment </v>
<v Speaker 1>a descent in this country or that,</v>

87
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.480
<v Speaker 1>and that relationship of the president </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the CIO is broken.</v>

88
00:04:45.481 --> 00:04:46.314
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The CIA has now more like the FBI at </v>

89
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.363
<v Speaker 1>works at one step removed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a mission to go out into the </v>

90
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:56.100
<v Speaker 1>world and steal secrets and occasionally</v>
<v Speaker 1>go out in the world and blow up bridges.</v>

91
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.510
<v Speaker 1>But it's doing that almost as a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate like,</v>

92
00:05:00.511 --> 00:05:01.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

93
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.093
<v Speaker 1>like the Federal Reserve that does </v>
<v Speaker 1>monetary policy that they're divorced </v>

94
00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:05.964
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from policy and decision making or if </v>

95
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.060
<v Speaker 1>there's an intermediary and the DA and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dni.</v>

96
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.283
<v Speaker 1>And I think Hayden has not been able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite resolve how this reorganization </v>

97
00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:18.960
<v Speaker 1>will play out in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the life of the institution.</v>

98
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a very heated debate yeah.</v>

99
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Within the U s army and the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuing now,</v>

100
00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:31.380
<v Speaker 1>and I'm still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing some work on this now.</v>

101
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

102
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strain,</v>

103
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.580
<v Speaker 1>everyone agrees there was an enormous </v>
<v Speaker 1>strain.</v>

104
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>

105
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

106
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:42.683
<v Speaker 1>the questions that are debated are what </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the strategic consequences of this </v>

107
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:47.400
<v Speaker 1>strain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

108
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.893
<v Speaker 1>and on the one hand you have those like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Casey or a certain colonels and others </v>

109
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 1>who would emphasize the loss of combat </v>
<v Speaker 1>capability,</v>

110
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.273
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential for a surprise elsewhere </v>

111
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 1>in the world that the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't respond to.</v>

112
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

113
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.653
<v Speaker 1>and the general sort of inability of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States to say pivot from Iraq </v>

114
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 1>where things may be going better to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan,</v>

115
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>where things are clearly going worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there just is no,</v>

116
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.090
<v Speaker 1>there's no elasticity in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the system anymore.</v>

117
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>The resources are all on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the field.</v>

118
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 1>So that's one side.</v>

119
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 1>The other side emphasizes as gates did </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a speech a couple of weeks ago,</v>

120
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.013
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have armies to win the wars that </v>

121
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 1>we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

122
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:43.270
<v Speaker 1>I would rather break an army winning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 1>the war that we have to win than worry </v>
<v Speaker 1>about some future scenario.</v>

124
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:49.783
<v Speaker 1>Nobody this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So somebody was arguing with her the </v>

125
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.730
<v Speaker 1>other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I says,</v>

126
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:52.563
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody worried during World War II that </v>

127
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:56.054
<v Speaker 1>we were going to break the army and </v>
<v Speaker 1>overemphasize figuring out how to beat </v>

128
00:06:59.091 --> 00:06:59.924
<v Speaker 1>Nazi Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we were going to miss Vietnam </v>

129
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 1>because we hadn't prepared for </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterinsurgency.</v>

130
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:04.523
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

131
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.503
<v Speaker 1>that's what you have armies for is to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>all out to achieve the objectives you </v>

132
00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:09.554
<v Speaker 1>need to achieve now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then that depends on whether you </v>

133
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:14.770
<v Speaker 1>believe finishing in Iraq with every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

134
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 1>brigade available is really in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>national interest.</v>

135
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.161
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

136
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:19.994
<v Speaker 1>and so in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these arguments about strain and </v>

137
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:24.790
<v Speaker 1>breaking the army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

138
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.730
<v Speaker 1>there are kind of coded argument about </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether the rock is still worthwhile.</v>

139
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.700
<v Speaker 2>I think the hud still important for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of them</v>

140
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.760
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

141
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting with justice,</v>

142
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:40.694
<v Speaker 1>at large and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and has more or less accepted </v>

144
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for the attacks and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one's ever bothered to chase him down.</v>

145
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more sort of relevant to the current</v>

146
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

147
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:55.220
<v Speaker 1>we talked before about the 20 years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuous leadership,</v>

148
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.340
<v Speaker 1>the ability to deliver messages to </v>
<v Speaker 1>followers,</v>

149
00:07:58.341 --> 00:07:59.174
<v Speaker 1>to define the narrative of the war that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he believes he's leading to identify </v>

150
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.430
<v Speaker 1>targets to name countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's still matters.</v>

151
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.740
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter the way he did in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1999,</v>

152
00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:07.574
<v Speaker 1>but taking him off the airwaves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forcing al-Qaida to deal for the first </v>

153
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:13.070
<v Speaker 1>time in 20 years with a succession </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>

154
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.353
<v Speaker 1>probably from the point of view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcaide his adversaries would be a good </v>

155
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:18.080
<v Speaker 1>objective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

156
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.720
<v Speaker 1>so I think there are lots of reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

157
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.440
<v Speaker 1>the hunt for him still matters as to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what al Qaeda is capability is,</v>

158
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this year.</v>

159
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all you can really do is look at</v>

160
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:32.204
<v Speaker 1>what the system is reporting by way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of threat reporting on the one </v>

161
00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:36.434
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what all the open source </v>

162
00:08:37.671 --> 00:08:41.840
<v Speaker 1>evidence from the last three or four </v>
<v Speaker 1>years tells you about their capability.</v>

163
00:08:41.841 --> 00:08:42.674
<v Speaker 1>And I think that in summary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it tells you is that they still </v>

164
00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:51.071
<v Speaker 1>have the intent to carry out what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might think of as sort of medium sized,</v>

165
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks against airplanes,</v>

166
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against,</v>

167
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subway systems against embassies,</v>

168
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.740
<v Speaker 1>military bases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the capability to plan sort of</v>

169
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:06.900
<v Speaker 1>six to nine month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly complicated,</v>

170
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:07.734
<v Speaker 1>fairly ambitious plans like the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's on trial in London involving the </v>

171
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 1>attempt to blow up planes over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic in August of 2006,</v>

172
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 1>the one that led to us not being able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>carry our toothpaste board airplanes,</v>

173
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.560
<v Speaker 1>that was their most ambitious plots </v>
<v Speaker 1>since nine 11.</v>

174
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.900
<v Speaker 1>It was meant to be the fifth anniversary</v>
<v Speaker 1>plot.</v>

175
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.870
<v Speaker 1>It was meant to take down five to 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>planes.</v>

176
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Speaker 1>If it's exceeded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have,</v>

177
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:26.843
<v Speaker 1>we'd be living in a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'd be 600 or more dead Americans </v>

178
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:30.624
<v Speaker 1>and Brits lying in the Atlantic Ocean </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'd probably be occupying the </v>

179
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 1>federally administered tribal areas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in engaged in a very vicious,</v>

180
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:37.044
<v Speaker 1>a counter insurgency campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's been their most ambitious </v>

181
00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 1>plot since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

182
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:44.130
<v Speaker 1>it's a couple of orders of magnitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>short of nine 11.</v>

183
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.600
<v Speaker 1>So I think they'll probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

184
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.160
<v Speaker 1>bin Ladin keeps an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Al Kind keeps an eye on the calendar.</v>

185
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:50.994
<v Speaker 1>They know this is an election season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he'll probably want to do </v>

186
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:54.504
<v Speaker 1>something in 2004 what we can see in </v>
<v Speaker 1>retrospect is that he didn't have the </v>

187
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:00.660
<v Speaker 1>capability to do anything other than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>media event,</v>

188
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.943
<v Speaker 1>but he appeared like an apparition on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the weekend before the election and </v>

189
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.430
<v Speaker 1>delivered this message to the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

190
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:09.264
<v Speaker 1>John Kerry's still believes that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>day was a factor in his defeat in a </v>

191
00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:13.140
<v Speaker 1>close election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at a minimum,</v>

192
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:18.170
<v Speaker 1>I expect them to attempt media events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they have capability of,</v>

193
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.720
<v Speaker 1>they'll probably will use it during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall season.</v>

194
00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:22.554
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
