00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.170
<v Speaker 1>In China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are basically two major issues.</v>

2
00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:12.730
<v Speaker 1>The first issue is that there is not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of intellectual property enforcement</v>

3
00:00:12.731 --> 00:00:17.731
<v Speaker 1>on the streets or in the web rooms on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a that you can find pirated</v>

4
00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:23.761
<v Speaker 1>material all over China and there's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a very effective way of enforcing</v>

5
00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:25.660
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're working on that,</v>

6
00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very slow.</v>

7
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>The second problem is market access.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese were severely restrict the</v>

8
00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:35.320
<v Speaker 1>amount of foreign product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including American product,</v>

9
00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:38.020
<v Speaker 1>a film product that comes into China</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegally,</v>

10
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.860
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not only is that bad in and of</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

11
00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:46.630
<v Speaker 1>but then encourages more pirated</v>
<v Speaker 1>material to to be on the streets because</v>

12
00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:50.590
<v Speaker 1>you can find almost anything that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever been produced in the history of the</v>

13
00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:53.500
<v Speaker 1>human race in China that's on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>streets illegally.</v>
