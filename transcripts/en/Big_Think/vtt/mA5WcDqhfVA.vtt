1
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I think we've got a lot of scientists</v>
<v Speaker 1>working in the United States,</v>

2
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:13.780
<v Speaker 1>certainly already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>would we like to have more funding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course everybody wants more funding</v>

4
00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:19.450
<v Speaker 1>for their particular area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 1>if I were in the theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd been in demand more government</v>

6
00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:23.610
<v Speaker 1>funding for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Speaker 1>theater productions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more money would be nice.</v>

9
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:32.121
<v Speaker 1>But I think the real role that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>president can play in this broader kind</v>

10
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.520
<v Speaker 1>of theme of Science Literacy is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>education using the presidency as a</v>

11
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>bully pulpit to get out the message that</v>
<v Speaker 1>science is important.</v>

12
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not just something that's done by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientists,</v>

13
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>for the scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's done by the scientists who were</v>

14
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>citizens for everybody else in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country and it with the collaboration of</v>

15
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>everybody else in the country because at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least in terms of a government supported</v>

16
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's paid for by the rest of the</v>

17
00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

18
00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think scientists have a role to play</v>

19
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think scientists should perhaps make</v>

20
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 1>more of an effort to communicate with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the public at large about the work</v>

21
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>they're doing and the implications and</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it's important.</v>

22
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

23
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.240
<v Speaker 1>it's perhaps easier to ask for more</v>
<v Speaker 1>money than it is to explain to people</v>

24
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>who don't have a scientific background</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you need more money.</v>

25
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 1>But I think the latter is at least as</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

26
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's these days,</v>

27
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:27.350
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of being a scientist,</v>

28
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>but responsible somehow.</v>
