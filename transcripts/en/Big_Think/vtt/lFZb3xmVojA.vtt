00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always stay away from,</v>

2
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I live in a place which has been cursed</v>
<v Speaker 1>with interference by,</v>

3
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>by olders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

4
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.320
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the party that I represent a keep to a</v>

5
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.181
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

6
00:00:25.181 --> 00:00:28.830
<v Speaker 1>very rigidly neutral lane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

7
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:33.831
<v Speaker 1>people to hear a decide in terms of who</v>
<v Speaker 1>your president does,</v>

8
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>who your congress members is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your government does as a modern</v>

9
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:41.100
<v Speaker 1>tardy for people who live here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From an artist perspective,</v>

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>of course we're entitled to say we want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Ireland to be part of that.</v>

11
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.720
<v Speaker 1>And given that 46 million or so people</v>
<v Speaker 1>here have their roots in Ireland,</v>

12
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>we think that should be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an issue.</v>

13
00:00:56.971 --> 00:01:00.810
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some moral at arden does partitioned,</v>

14
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.153
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

15
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.340
<v Speaker 1>that's another gentleman and coercion</v>
<v Speaker 1>into our affairs at con be stripped and</v>

16
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm quite sure that if a future</v>

17
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>administration decided it was setting</v>
<v Speaker 1>that strategic interest to incorporate</v>

18
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.070
<v Speaker 1>the British government to create</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions for our issue them to the</v>

19
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>dump would hop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so without getting involved in any</v>

20
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:24.080
<v Speaker 1>of the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 1>I certainly would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would argue that it should be a martyr.</v>

23
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>And incidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the most successful foreign policy</v>

24
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.000
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>at this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

26
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:40.161
<v Speaker 1>the red is based process in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A held in its infancy by President</v>

27
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Clinton continues to be helped by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush administration.</v>

28
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.820
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

29
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>it's the success that has worked and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would not have worked except for Irish</v>

30
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.500
<v Speaker 1>America and for the people who live here</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the U.</v>

31
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>S.</v>
