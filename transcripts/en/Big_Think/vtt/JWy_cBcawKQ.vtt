00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Flow genome project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we've discovered when people want</v>

2
00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:06.810
<v Speaker 1>more flow in their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number one thing we can tell them is</v>

3
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:10.410
<v Speaker 1>that there is a flow cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the old idea about flow was that it</v>

4
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:12.270
<v Speaker 1>was a binary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a light switch.</v>

5
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>You were in the zone or you were out his</v>
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

6
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>What we now know is that flow is a four</v>
<v Speaker 1>part cycle and you have to move through</v>

7
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>all four parts of these cycle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cycle before you can return to the flow</v>

8
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:24.324
<v Speaker 1>state itself,</v>

9
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.070
<v Speaker 1>the neurobiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that flow side.</v>

10
00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:39.310
<v Speaker 1>When the actual research came out of her</v>
<v Speaker 1>Benson's work at Harvard,</v>

11
00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:42.760
<v Speaker 1>he kind of laid the foundation for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what we've discovered is that the</v>

12
00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:45.310
<v Speaker 1>front end of the flow state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a struggle phase.</v>

13
00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.010
<v Speaker 1>This is a loading phase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are loading then overloading the</v>

14
00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:51.640
<v Speaker 1>brain with information for a baseball</v>
<v Speaker 1>player.</v>

15
00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:56.320
<v Speaker 1>This is learning to swing a bat and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball for a writer planning a new book.</v>

16
00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:59.050
<v Speaker 1>This is when you're doing interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is when you're reading,</v>

17
00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:01.300
<v Speaker 1>it's when you're diagramming structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things like that.</v>

18
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.800
<v Speaker 1>It's very unpleasant as a general rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even the flow may be the most</v>

19
00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:09.640
<v Speaker 1>desirable and pleasant stayed on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual flow cycle itself starts with</v>

20
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.670
<v Speaker 1>a very unpleasant state known as</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle from struggle.</v>

21
00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:15.640
<v Speaker 1>You move into a release.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This literally means you want to take</v>

22
00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.020
<v Speaker 1>your mind off the problem.</v>

23
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.100
<v Speaker 1>So what happens in flow is we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>trading conscious processing,</v>

24
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>which is slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has very limited Ram,</v>

25
00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:25.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The working memory can only hold about</v>

26
00:01:25.421 --> 00:01:30.070
<v Speaker 1>four items at once and it's very energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>inefficient for subconscious processing,</v>

27
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.060
<v Speaker 1>which is extremely fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very energy efficient and has</v>

28
00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:37.360
<v Speaker 1>pretty much endless ram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to do that you have to move from</v>

29
00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:39.820
<v Speaker 1>struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have to let stop thinking about</v>

30
00:01:39.821 --> 00:01:41.500
<v Speaker 1>what you were trying to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

31
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.200
<v Speaker 1>you take your mind off the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go for long walks.</v>

32
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Gardening works very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Building models works very,</v>

33
00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:49.780
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Albert Einstein famously used to row a</v>

34
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:52.420
<v Speaker 1>boat in the middle of Lake Geneva and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stare at the clouds,</v>

35
00:01:52.421 --> 00:01:54.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you can take your mind off the</v>

36
00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:56.020
<v Speaker 1>problem and it won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

37
00:01:56.021 --> 00:01:59.340
<v Speaker 1>one of the only things that you can't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move through release is watched</v>

38
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:01.720
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually changes your brain waves in</v>

39
00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:02.920
<v Speaker 1>a way that will block flow.</v>

40
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>But once you move from release,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

41
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.040
<v Speaker 1>actually underneath the surface neuro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biologically there's a global release of</v>

42
00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>nitric oxide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a gas is signaling molecule.</v>

43
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:15.550
<v Speaker 1>It's found everywhere in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This flushes all the stress hormones out</v>

44
00:02:15.551 --> 00:02:18.670
<v Speaker 1>of your system and replaces them with</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of feel good performance.</v>

45
00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Nancy neurochemicals like dopamine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin and endorphins which underpin</v>

46
00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:26.800
<v Speaker 1>the flow state as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in the flow state itself.</v>

47
00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:29.800
<v Speaker 1>This is the third stage and the struggle</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on the back end of the flow state</v>

48
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.190
<v Speaker 1>there is actually a recovery phase and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really,</v>

49
00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:34.270
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really critical.</v>

50
00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:38.890
<v Speaker 1>So you go from this amazing high of flow</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a very deep low that shows up in</v>

51
00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:41.450
<v Speaker 1>recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of this is that all those feelgood</v>

52
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.300
<v Speaker 1>neurochemicals that drained out of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

53
00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:47.200
<v Speaker 1>it takes certain vitamins and minerals</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sunlight and things like that to</v>

54
00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:48.100
<v Speaker 1>rebuild them.</v>

55
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.360
<v Speaker 1>So the recovery phase on the back end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flow state is actually very,</v>

56
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:55.930
<v Speaker 1>very unpleasant as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you really want to hack flow,</v>

57
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.690
<v Speaker 1>you need to learn how to struggle better</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you need how to learn how to</v>

58
00:02:58.691 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the most important things in</v>

59
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>recovery is you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need some emotional fortitude,</v>

60
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>some grit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to basically hold onto your</v>

61
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not get stressed out at the fact that</v>

62
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>you no longer feel like superman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the main reason,</v>

63
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 1>what two reasons for this is one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get too stressed out and feeling</v>

64
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to start producing</v>

65
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>cortisol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little bit is fine.</v>

66
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Too much of it blocks the accelerated</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning that comes with flow.</v>

67
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>So you will actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get the short term benefit of the</v>

68
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:30.840
<v Speaker 1>flow state itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you won't get the longterm benefit,</v>

69
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>the accelerated learning that you get in</v>
<v Speaker 1>flow.</v>

70
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.650
<v Speaker 1>The other problem is if you have to move</v>
<v Speaker 1>from recovery back into struggle and</v>

71
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>you're bummed out at no longer being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>flow during the recovery phase,</v>

72
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.350
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to get up for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult place of struggle that</v>

73
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>follows.</v>
