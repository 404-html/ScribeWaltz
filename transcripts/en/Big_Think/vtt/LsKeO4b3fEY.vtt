00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.083
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Our business focuses us on diversity</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we all work in a sport that was</v>

3
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:16.491
<v Speaker 2>deemed too black to thrive and actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>even survive.</v>

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 2>People Forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there were articles,</v>

5
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:23.970
<v Speaker 2>the dark clouds over the NBA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:24.661
<v Speaker 2>mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

7
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 2>I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was executive vice president,</v>

8
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Larry sent me up to a newspaper and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

9
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 2>the television guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get it stern.</v>

10
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.430
<v Speaker 2>You guys are just not going to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a white country and you have a</v>

11
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 2>black sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we developed chips on our shoulder</v>

12
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:49.890
<v Speaker 2>early on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you worked at the NBA in the 70s,</v>

13
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.310
<v Speaker 2>you had to be a believer that America</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a good country and that we had</v>

14
00:00:56.701 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 2>something to teach rather than to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of a sport,</v>

15
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could have Willis Reed from</v>

16
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:09.741
<v Speaker 2>Louisiana and grambling and the bill</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bradley from a Crystal City,</v>

17
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Missouri and Princeton on a championship</v>
<v Speaker 2>team.</v>

18
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That says something about a sport that</v>

19
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 2>has something to teach that's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's about talent.</v>

20
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.970
<v Speaker 2>We sort of rallied around the notion</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you came to an NBA game,</v>

21
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.140
<v Speaker 2>it didn't matter where you sat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

22
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.580
<v Speaker 2>whether you were in the nosebleed</v>
<v Speaker 2>section or at court side,</v>

23
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 2>your opinion counted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And regardless of your race,</v>

24
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.270
<v Speaker 2>and if you were on the court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

25
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 2>your talent counted regardless of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

26
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:42.990
<v Speaker 2>You got game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you play,</v>

27
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:44.010
<v Speaker 2>you don't have game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

28
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 2>And so this was a subject of some</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion at the NBA always on an</v>

29
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:52.530
<v Speaker 2>ongoing basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it has ramifications throughout our</v>

30
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 2>whole business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was,</v>

31
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:55.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

32
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.510
<v Speaker 2>required to act when Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our test,</v>

33
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ran into the stands in Detroit and there</v>

34
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:03.640
<v Speaker 2>was a big brawl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

35
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 2>the talk radio that weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

36
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.740
<v Speaker 2>the words thugs and punks was uttered</v>
<v Speaker 2>what seem to be about a million times,</v>

37
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it was less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we will know the code words.</v>

38
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.340
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we're,</v>

39
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.380
<v Speaker 2>we tend to be particularly protective of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our players in that regard.</v>

40
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:29.880
<v Speaker 2>And I think it makes us conscious of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of different things,</v>

41
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having to do with the racial discussion.</v>
