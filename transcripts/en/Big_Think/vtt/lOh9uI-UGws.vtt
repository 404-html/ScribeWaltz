1
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 1>It is very difficult to it on the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:15.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like a person wants to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking,</v>

3
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're addicted to smoking and he's not</v>

4
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>so hard to stop one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

5
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:23.070
<v Speaker 1>three days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most people will relapse after two</v>

6
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Speaker 1>or three days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing with,</v>

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.840
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with diets and food for once these,</v>

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.120
<v Speaker 1>these changes that'll cure these</v>
<v Speaker 1>condition responses.</v>

9
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Number one are long lasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you are going to be constantly</v>

10
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>inhibiting these pre potent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.090
<v Speaker 1>nice to actually want to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Imagine Your Day,</v>

12
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of sorts of the managing my day</v>

13
00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>24 hours in the morning and go run</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>

14
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm all all wired up so I have perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

15
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Nothing bad has happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I basic alley loose,</v>

16
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>loose my key on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to make these huge line and then</v>

17
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>the secretary insults me and I have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

18
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:11.611
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

19
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:11.851
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

20
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:12.684
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get.</v>

21
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>So you start to get frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm frustrated and frustrated and angry</v>

22
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:21.501
<v Speaker 1>and angry and your ability to then</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulate this urge to eat the food</v>

23
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>starts to be on their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as we get frustrated,</v>

24
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 1>as we get stressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our ability to exert control gets</v>

25
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>diminished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to die then this is one,</v>

26
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons is not the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

27
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll come back to it in a second.</v>

28
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.590
<v Speaker 1>The ability to exert control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to control our emotions and our</v>

29
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:49.770
<v Speaker 1>behaviors gets eroded when we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>stressed,</v>

30
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.430
<v Speaker 1>when we're tired or actually when we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>full deprived and that's why people</v>

31
00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:58.530
<v Speaker 1>become irritable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is actually,</v>

32
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a response where your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain,</v>

33
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:06.561
<v Speaker 1>your body sensing that you are in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>state of deprivation and under a state</v>

34
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:12.321
<v Speaker 1>of the premade Bayesian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your main full state changes to go and</v>

35
00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>want to do that behavior that will get</v>
<v Speaker 1>you out of that state.</v>

36
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.230
<v Speaker 1>So you have again that balance of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense drive to get out of that very</v>

37
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant state and on the other one</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cognition and says,</v>

38
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.050
<v Speaker 1>I want to lose weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to lose weight and there is a</v>

39
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:32.600
<v Speaker 1>point that you do lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lose this battle and so you give in</v>

40
00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>and you get a stressor comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The flight has been canceled.</v>

41
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>I've been dealing with all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these psych had a bad day on my flight</v>

42
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>on top of everything gets canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at that moment you lose the ability</v>

43
00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 1>to control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of the things I need to,</v>

44
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same thing with drugs or</v>
<v Speaker 1>weed smoking behavior.</v>

45
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>A person he's doing fine and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden their spouse says,</v>

46
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want the divorce when they have been</v>

47
00:02:57.301 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>stopped smoking and then they relapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something very,</v>

48
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 1>very stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lose that ability.</v>

49
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.790
<v Speaker 1>There are all other things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are um,</v>

50
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.693
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

51
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>shown by animal stories that may also</v>
<v Speaker 1>being very,</v>

52
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>very provocative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

53
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>this is at the research level in</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

54
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't been shown in humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in my view,</v>

55
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>the moment that I started to see results</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that in animals,</v>

56
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>I want to question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this happening in humans?</v>

57
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 1>There's been a series of stories now by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Hobble,</v>

58
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for many years.</v>

59
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

60
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>when I read these I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

61
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.290
<v Speaker 1>where he takes rods on key,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives them a diet high in sure we'll,</v>

62
00:03:36.291 --> 00:03:38.450
<v Speaker 1>we'll eat the societies a lot of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 1>he takes these little ruts and gives</v>
<v Speaker 1>them high amounts of sugar and then he</v>

64
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:47.641
<v Speaker 1>takes these animals and gives them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I draw that we call an opiate antagonist</v>

65
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you say an opiate?</v>

66
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 1>The Taiwanese and not being a townie.</v>

67
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Some medication that when you give to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rat only when you give it to a rod that</v>

68
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:01.861
<v Speaker 1>has been repeatedly exposed to opiates</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm caroline.</v>

69
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Morphine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oxycontin,</v>

70
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>repeated exposure only when it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeated,</v>

71
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 1>you gave that you trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I withdraw like a heroin withdraw.</v>

72
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>The animus satish shatters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gets to shake and a,</v>

73
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:18.490
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unpleasant for the animal.</v>

74
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>When a kid these these opiate antagonist</v>
<v Speaker 1>into an animal that has been exposed to</v>

75
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 1>high content of sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he triggers an opiate withdraw.</v>

76
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.110
<v Speaker 1>This is incredibly unpleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

77
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that we haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>studied in humans is could there be</v>

78
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:40.951
<v Speaker 1>something similar that they're eas are</v>
<v Speaker 1>we draw out just like it's been shown in</v>

79
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:46.681
<v Speaker 1>animals or Kurian when a person is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stops in a diet and then they basically</v>

80
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:52.981
<v Speaker 1>are courting the intake of sugar which</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberates endogenous opiates,</v>

81
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 1>so no longer those endogenous opiates</v>
<v Speaker 1>are being liberated and your creating a</v>

82
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:03.301
<v Speaker 1>mile state of withdraw that he's not of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course so powerful that you recognize</v>

83
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that may be creating this state of</v>

84
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>dysphoria and discomfort.</v>

85
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.190
<v Speaker 1>This is artifactually factually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what happens when you put</v>

86
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 1>someone on on withdrawal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maya withdrawal from opiates.</v>

87
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they're going to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaking,</v>

88
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.850
<v Speaker 1>but there's a sense of discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just you're not feeling well on</v>

89
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.120
<v Speaker 1>your Stinger like like that and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unpleasant.</v>

90
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.140
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extent to which a similar process,</v>

91
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:31.540
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe happening is something that should</v>

92
00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 1>be investigated that could also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if proven correct,</v>

93
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.210
<v Speaker 1>help to understand why so very difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go into a diet.</v>

94
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.880
<v Speaker 1>And we'll also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's again,</v>

95
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 1>a document that in humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is documented in animals,</v>

96
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.120
<v Speaker 1>could provide a strategist to help so</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

97
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 1>so that they don't have these very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these very disagreeable state of</v>

98
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 1>discomfort.</v>
