1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 2>well you're not really friends and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's unusual is that I've even</v>

3
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.420
<v Speaker 2>operated on some friends and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed our relationship because they've</v>

4
00:00:18.431 --> 00:00:21.910
<v Speaker 2>gone from being friends to being friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>had operated on and,</v>

5
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.310
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I almost named their doctor now more</v>

6
00:00:24.311 --> 00:00:26.350
<v Speaker 2>than their friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

7
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.810
<v Speaker 2>and it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father operated on folks in town and</v>

9
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.130
<v Speaker 2>had an interesting perspective on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because we're from a small town.</v>

10
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 2>He usually new people he was operating</v>
<v Speaker 2>on any often found it odd to not know a</v>

11
00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:50.050
<v Speaker 2>person who was operating on he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He liked it better when you knew because</v>

12
00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:53.320
<v Speaker 2>you felt more invested even though he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had complications and things go wrong</v>

13
00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:56.860
<v Speaker 2>like anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas in a big city practice,</v>

14
00:00:56.861 --> 00:00:58.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

15
00:00:58.781 --> 00:00:59.614
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

16
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.440
<v Speaker 2>I always end up thinking twice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

17
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.550
<v Speaker 2>one of my colleagues operated on his</v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend's a boyfriend.</v>

18
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

19
00:01:08.021 --> 00:01:12.230
<v Speaker 2>his daughter's boyfriend and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all kind of scratch your head as you</v>

21
00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:14.854
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

22
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.260
<v Speaker 2>you know who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who better to take a look at this guy.</v>

23
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think the,</v>

24
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a necessary though,</v>

25
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.640
<v Speaker 2>professional line where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

26
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.080
<v Speaker 2>people are relying on you to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>something more than a friend.</v>

27
00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 2>They're relying on you to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>professional and to,</v>

28
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.510
<v Speaker 2>by being a professional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means I'm really thinking through</v>

29
00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:43.930
<v Speaker 2>how to do things optimally for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give them their best chance,</v>

30
00:01:43.931 --> 00:01:48.931
<v Speaker 2>worked with other people as a team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that goes beyond what friendship</v>

31
00:01:49.181 --> 00:01:50.350
<v Speaker 2>requires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

32
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.243
<v Speaker 2>it's just different.</v>

33
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some ways it deepens it because you</v>

34
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 2>understand their issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a cancer surgeon,</v>

35
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:02.790
<v Speaker 2>most of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I do general surgery,</v>

36
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:07.791
<v Speaker 2>but most of the patients I take care of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our cancer patients and I'm a.</v>

37
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.670
<v Speaker 2>and it changes it in the sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

38
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 2>well let me put this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

39
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I haven't ever operated on</v>

40
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 2>someone who's really my best friend and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I would do that,</v>

41
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:22.290
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but folks who are friends,</v>

42
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 2>colleagues from work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

43
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.620
<v Speaker 2>who are the same age as me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

44
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.270
<v Speaker 2>we find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

45
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 2>that they're not sure what to call me</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

46
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.210
<v Speaker 2>They always called me a tool before and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they almost want to call me Dr</v>

47
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.900
<v Speaker 2>Gawande because they see me that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

48
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.741
<v Speaker 2>and I would say to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

49
00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:43.981
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

50
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 2>call me a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is that,</v>

51
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 2>that discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see them deciding,</v>

52
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't call them anything.</v>

53
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 2>I'll just say hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the friendship can become both</v>

54
00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 2>deeper and yet a little more formal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We ended up talking about,</v>

55
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life and death and their fears will,</v>

56
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 2>this cancer comeback is often very high</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their minds.</v>

57
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes it hard to just talk about,</v>

58
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

59
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 2>that movie Avatar was not that good was</v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

60
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't think gratitudes right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right word.</v>

61
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

62
00:03:21.921 --> 00:03:24.770
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're getting so good at doing what we</v>

63
00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:27.440
<v Speaker 2>do in medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not good enough.</v>

64
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it goes well,</v>

65
00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:33.020
<v Speaker 2>there's enormous relief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's an expectation that,</v>

66
00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:34.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the way it should have gone.</v>

67
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.940
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what they feel like is there's</v>

68
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.050
<v Speaker 2>this person here who is the source of</v>
<v Speaker 2>information for me who can tell me</v>

69
00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:45.020
<v Speaker 2>something about what's going on that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't really understand.</v>

70
00:03:45.021 --> 00:03:47.240
<v Speaker 2>And so when we run into each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

71
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.780
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand we might be sharing cd</v>
<v Speaker 2>recommendations,</v>

72
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.340
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitably they can't get out of the</v>

73
00:03:55.341 --> 00:03:59.570
<v Speaker 2>room and meeting up without wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>just take you aside and say,</v>

74
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.411
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

75
00:04:00.411 --> 00:04:04.130
<v Speaker 2>I've been having this going on or that</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on and is there anything I should</v>

76
00:04:04.131 --> 00:04:09.131
<v Speaker 2>be worried about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that discussion is very different in</v>

77
00:04:09.711 --> 00:04:10.341
<v Speaker 2>some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

78
00:04:10.341 --> 00:04:11.990
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to escape it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

79
00:04:11.991 --> 00:04:14.840
<v Speaker 2>let's just have a regular old</v>
<v Speaker 2>friendship.</v>

80
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.960
<v Speaker 2>But in other ways it is special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

81
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.840
<v Speaker 2>I liked that connection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being able to be helpful.</v>
