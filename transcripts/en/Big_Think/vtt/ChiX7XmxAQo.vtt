1
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a mix of both and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that represents the future of what</v>

2
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:15.690
<v Speaker 1>the mixed capitalism kind of model is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The State Ism that Europe has always</v>

3
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>practiced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where corporations and the government</v>

4
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 1>are very much in collusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what Asia has learned to do and does</v>

5
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:26.490
<v Speaker 1>itself at Korea and Japan and China are</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is something that basically if you</v>

6
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>take European economies and Asian</v>
<v Speaker 1>economies together,</v>

7
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>it puts us in the minority of players</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have been practicing real,</v>

8
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 1>genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free market sort of practices and</v>

9
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>economics in the last decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think we're going to learn to do</v>

10
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>things their way rather than vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That speaks to a broader critique of</v>

11
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:45.480
<v Speaker 1>globalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that we don't be,</v>

12
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>countries don't want to have unmanaged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfettered globalization.</v>

13
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.160
<v Speaker 1>They want to regulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:54.200
<v Speaker 1>they want to have capital controls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to direct and channel foreign</v>

15
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>investment in certain ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>to serve their own national needs and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>build their infrastructure and so forth.</v>

17
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the model that is prevailing now</v>

18
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 1>in Asia because it's proved to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>great payoffs.</v>

19
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the free market model is what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>blamed correctly or incorrectly for the</v>

20
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Asian financial crisis.</v>
