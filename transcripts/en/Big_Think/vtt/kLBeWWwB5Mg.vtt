00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.930
<v Speaker 1>So one of the great things about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization is that</v>

2
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.830
<v Speaker 1>All the different people have different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are curious about different things and</v>

4
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.520
<v Speaker 1>somehow if they all follow their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity in some way,</v>

5
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.390
<v Speaker 1>great stuff happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of what's happened so far.</v>

6
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a civilization where you're</v>

7
00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:37.991
<v Speaker 1>able to support people doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then uh,</v>

8
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>the civilization feels you feel happier</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in it.</v>

9
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I read about something that,</v>

10
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>whether it's art or biology or</v>
<v Speaker 1>sociology,</v>

11
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:52.430
<v Speaker 1>if I read about something interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I realize that some humans actually</v>

12
00:00:52.431 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 1>spent their whole life doing that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

13
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.640
<v Speaker 1>and that we supported them doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I f I feel like that's the,</v>

14
00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:01.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pinnacle of civilization that's the</v>

15
00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

16
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons we fund these</v>

17
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.380
<v Speaker 1>experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.610
<v Speaker 1>is because we want to live in a world</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people find stuff out.</v>

19
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you funded nothing in science</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you never found anything out.</v>

20
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.940
<v Speaker 1>How depressing would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know actually.</v>

21
00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:27.020
<v Speaker 1>How depressing would that be that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be pretty depressing.</v>

22
00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Or imagine a world in which nobody could</v>
<v Speaker 1>write books or,</v>

23
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason to fund things,</v>

24
00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:34.461
<v Speaker 1>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

25
00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:37.460
<v Speaker 1>you can't argue that any stupid thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should fund,</v>

26
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.260
<v Speaker 1>but if there's a whole lot of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are interested in doing something and it</v>

27
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:44.480
<v Speaker 1>makes sense and they've worked on it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

28
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.060
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonable to fund it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you can,</v>

29
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some people who believe that,</v>

30
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:51.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should only fund things that make</v>

31
00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:54.350
<v Speaker 1>people's lives longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that seems ridiculous.</v>

32
00:01:54.351 --> 00:01:59.060
<v Speaker 1>How about making people's lives better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about people making people happier</v>

33
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.230
<v Speaker 1>to be alive because they can read cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff in the New York Times or whatever,</v>

34
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.110
<v Speaker 1>wherever in science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>

35
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.580
<v Speaker 1>so people are somehow moralistic about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the length of people's lives rather than</v>

36
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:13.910
<v Speaker 1>the quality of life or the rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the standard of living.</v>

37
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.010
<v Speaker 1>So I think by me doing particle physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it raises everybody's standard of</v>

38
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:20.480
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

39
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.940
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

40
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.710
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I shouldn't be quoted that way,</v>

41
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.540
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I do that.</v>
