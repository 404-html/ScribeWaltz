1
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>So when one country intervenes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>another country's civil war,</v>

2
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>extends the war and if you think about</v>

3
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening is you're having more</v>

4
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>resources coming into that conflict and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bringing in new resources,</v>

5
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:22.200
<v Speaker 1>bringing a new interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically complicating and complexifying</v>

6
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>that war that was already a very complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

7
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>There are ways in which intervention</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be good,</v>

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>which is you're trying to pull the</v>
<v Speaker 1>parties apart,</v>

9
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.250
<v Speaker 1>not trying to pick sides one side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>picking the other side,</v>

10
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

11
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.460
<v Speaker 1>and that can sort of stop the killing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But typically before that happens,</v>

12
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 1>if outside states are getting involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a civil war,</v>

13
00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>it tends to extend it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So history is mixed on how to best solve</v>

14
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:46.240
<v Speaker 1>civil wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that the international</v>
<v Speaker 1>community has a strong proclivity toward</v>

16
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>a negotiated settlement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want the parties to both a lay</v>

17
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>down their arms and negotiate an end to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the civil war where each of them feels</v>

18
00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>as if they have a part to play in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>configuration of the new state.</v>

19
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>That is the absolute preference that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>international community has.</v>

20
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>And it pushes to that we're pushing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that today in Syria,</v>

21
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no discussion about negotiating</v>

22
00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:15.130
<v Speaker 1>with the Taliban because we understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may not be able to force an,</v>

23
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>an end to this war and that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>volleyball and are not going anywhere</v>

24
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 1>and that we might not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might have to negotiate with them.</v>

25
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.680
<v Speaker 1>The problem is in order for a negotiated</v>
<v Speaker 1>settlement to,</v>

26
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>to resolve a civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>requires both sides to stay absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed to that and to remain</v>

28
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 1>committed to that for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that requires for both sides,</v>

29
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>or if it was more than one side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about the former wars and</v>

30
00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Yugoslavia more than one side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That if they renege on the negotiated</v>

31
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>settlement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's going to be harmful to them</v>

32
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>and to their interests.</v>

33
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.910
<v Speaker 1>So you want to be thinking about how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ensure that both sides or all sides feel</v>

34
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:54.000
<v Speaker 1>compelled to stay aligned with what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiated settlement brought,</v>

35
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.043
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

36
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>in order to end the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one way to do that as to ensure that</v>

37
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>the security service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the armed forces are configured</v>

38
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:03.930
<v Speaker 1>correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they're representative of the</v>

39
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>broader nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another way is to have outside</v>

40
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>peacekeepers there to keep the parties</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

41
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>So you can think about the former</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yugoslavia or even Cyprus.</v>

42
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 1>There are peacekeepers there and they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been there now for decades in both</v>

43
00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:17.570
<v Speaker 1>places in Bosnia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

44
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>they were supposed to be there for one</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

45
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Bill President,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Clinton said we're only gonna be</v>

46
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>there for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was in 1995.</v>

47
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:27.540
<v Speaker 1>It's now 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And similarly in Cyprus,</v>

48
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:29.880
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peacekeepers were supposed to be there</v>

49
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>temporarily and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're somewhat permanently.</v>

50
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>The good news is you haven't had many</v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths as a result because the</v>

51
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>peacekeepers have Kevin apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So negotiated settlements are one way to</v>

52
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>sort of end wars and to keep them w</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended.</v>

53
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.000
<v Speaker 1>But actually they're quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>

54
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.640
<v Speaker 1>they're not the most common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

55
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>an alternative is thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>military victories,</v>

56
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:53.150
<v Speaker 1>which end today about half of civil wars</v>
<v Speaker 1>prior to the end of the Cold War,</v>

57
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 1>ended three quarters of all civil wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a military victory just means that</v>

58
00:02:57.601 --> 00:03:01.680
<v Speaker 1>once I prevails on the battlefield and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out historically that there are</v>

59
00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>more robust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one,</v>

60
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>one side winds and prevails and civil</v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

61
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to have a longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>lasting settlement.</v>

62
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the question is why is that?</v>

63
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>So I've researched that and it turns out</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe the reason is,</v>

64
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 1>is because to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reason,</v>

65
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that rebel victories or</v>
<v Speaker 1>even more a robust,</v>

66
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is,</v>

67
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>is that by defeating the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've demonstrated that you have the</v>

68
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>capacity to beat the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

69
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>that you actually have the military</v>
<v Speaker 1>might.</v>

70
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>So when you think about those negotiated</v>
<v Speaker 1>settlements,</v>

71
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>that's what a third party is providing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the capacity to keep the players</v>

72
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And secondarily,</v>

73
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:38.830
<v Speaker 1>particularly when it comes to rebel</v>
<v Speaker 1>victories,</v>

74
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 1>why they're more robust is they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimacy.</v>

75
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.680
<v Speaker 1>So they defeated the government and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually can bring the population behind</v>

76
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>them to support the configuration and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the running of the new government.</v>

77
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rebels quite often bring opposition</v>

78
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>into government in order to more</v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively govern.</v>

79
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 1>So military victories are an option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have been an option historically,</v>

80
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 1>the issue is the international community</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of doesn't support it because it</v>

81
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 1>sounds as if we're advocating the use of</v>
<v Speaker 1>force or the continued use of force.</v>

82
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

83
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pragmatist when it comes to these</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of things.</v>

84
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:15.950
<v Speaker 1>I look at the international community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>and where it wants to go and whether it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to go into different corners of</v>

86
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>the world and it's not willing to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>into every corner of the world,</v>

87
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 1>the international community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly large actors,</v>

88
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now Russia and the United States and its</v>

89
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:30.310
<v Speaker 1>allies aren't going to go everywhere.</v>

90
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 1>So they're not going to commit to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing peace to every corner of the</v>

91
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about me and mark today and there</v>

92
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 1>were hanging being targeted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and Mara has had a number of civil</v>

93
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:44.521
<v Speaker 1>wars raging for a number of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the international community does not</v>

94
00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 1>have the will to go in there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate separate pieces to bring peace</v>

95
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 1>to that country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And therefore we have to acknowledge and</v>

96
00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>recognize that military victories are</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

97
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>They have concluded civil wars most</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>

98
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they concluded two,</v>

99
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.660
<v Speaker 1>one was Sri Lanka where the government</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevailed over the Tamil Tigers after</v>

100
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>decades of fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now,</v>

101
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a horrific end to that civil war.</v>

102
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 1>There's no denying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were fears of genocide,</v>

103
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 1>but now the international community can</v>
<v Speaker 1>step in and say to the Sri Lankan</v>

104
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:19.040
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to treat the Tamil population a</v>

105
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>equitably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly justly and,</v>

106
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.240
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps work with the Sri Lankan</v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

107
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have them behave,</v>

108
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 1>to not sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

109
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.440
<v Speaker 1>take out vengeance a revenge against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>timing of population.</v>

110
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.220
<v Speaker 1>And then the other one is in south Sudan</v>
<v Speaker 1>with south Sudan.</v>

111
00:05:36.221 --> 00:05:38.270
<v Speaker 1>It was actually a rebel victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

112
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 1>and basically that was a rebel victory</v>
<v Speaker 1>that resulted in the partition and the</v>

113
00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 1>creation of a new state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which again,</v>

114
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:47.320
<v Speaker 1>partition is quite rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The international community doesn't</v>

115
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:51.760
<v Speaker 1>support the idea of making new states in</v>
<v Speaker 1>part because most states in the</v>

116
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 1>international system are multinational</v>
<v Speaker 1>and multiethnic and they don't want to</v>

117
00:05:55.991 --> 00:06:00.991
<v Speaker 1>set that precedent of allowing one state</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have in one state to allow for pieces</v>

118
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:06.140
<v Speaker 1>of it to break off because they fear</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it'll set off a set of dominoes,</v>

119
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 1>not only within their own state but what</v>
<v Speaker 1>globally.</v>

120
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

121
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>victory is a possibility as well as</v>

122
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:15.090
<v Speaker 1>negotiated settlements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

123
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 1>and when I look at these cases</v>
<v Speaker 1>historically,</v>

124
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 1>and then also contemporaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

125
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>when I'm looking at is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a will and the capacity of the</v>

126
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 1>international community to get involved.</v>

127
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 1>And if there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we might want to countenance</v>

128
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 1>victory for one side or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who were the good guys?</v>

129
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Who were the bad guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

130
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 1>in most of awards is a little bit about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on both,</v>

131
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 1>on some cases is a lot of bad on one</v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

132
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 1>a little bit about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on another.</v>

133
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you want to look at,</v>

134
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.771
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

135
00:06:41.771 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conditions about whether victory is</v>

136
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:47.240
<v Speaker 1>even a possibility and then negotiate a</v>
<v Speaker 1>settlement.</v>

137
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Is there a commitment from one party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United Nations,</v>

138
00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:54.840
<v Speaker 1>a coalition of states to go in and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>help keep the peace or to make peace and</v>

139
00:06:54.841 --> 00:06:57.830
<v Speaker 1>then help keep the peace later?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because without that commitment,</v>

140
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:03.010
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard for the parties to not be</v>
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to fighting down the road.</v>

141
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 1>It turns out if you have one civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your chances as the biggest indicator if</v>

142
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:10.820
<v Speaker 1>you have had a civil war in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your chances of having another civil war</v>

143
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 1>is much greater.</v>
