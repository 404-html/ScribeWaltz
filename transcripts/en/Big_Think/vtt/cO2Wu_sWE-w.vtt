1
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one when we move,</v>

2
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:19.340
<v Speaker 1>we moved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went to Ireland because of the death</v>

3
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.560
<v Speaker 1>death of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my little sister.</v>

4
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.800
<v Speaker 1>And there were uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brother frank,</v>

5
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.280
<v Speaker 1>myself and twin boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oliver and Eugene,</v>

6
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>and when we got to Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.190
<v Speaker 1>we want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within two years the two boys,</v>

8
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>you're Jaden Oliver died when they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>about four and four and a half of</v>

9
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.960
<v Speaker 1>various ailments at the time that nobody</v>
<v Speaker 1>cared too much about what was going on</v>

10
00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:46.760
<v Speaker 1>with poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were no autopsies or anything.</v>

11
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:50.660
<v Speaker 1>He just died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just died and good riddance.</v>

12
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.240
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.570
<v Speaker 1>but when we got a children's levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three and a half,</v>

14
00:00:56.571 --> 00:00:58.010
<v Speaker 1>frank was born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were known as Yanks and uh,</v>

16
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.760
<v Speaker 1>you feel outside the tribe when you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking differently,</v>

17
00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:13.730
<v Speaker 1>acting differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaving differently.</v>

18
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.180
<v Speaker 1>So as quickly as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made the attempt to be a get in with</v>

19
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:23.870
<v Speaker 1>the gang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk like them and be like them and</v>

20
00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 1>dressed like them.</v>

21
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.820
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

22
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.720
<v Speaker 1>no matter what we did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were still yanks.</v>

23
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.530
<v Speaker 1>So then we grow up there and we come to</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

24
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to America back here.</v>

25
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.880
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

26
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:41.810
<v Speaker 1>you're Irish over there were yanks over</v>
<v Speaker 1>here were Irish.</v>

27
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:46.811
<v Speaker 1>So my brother frank and myself decided a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time ago that worked for your very</v>

28
00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:53.171
<v Speaker 1>simply is we are New Yorkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is our country,</v>

29
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.290
<v Speaker 1>this is my land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the place for me where every</v>

30
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:05.081
<v Speaker 1>single dream I ever had came to fruition</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I love her dearly.</v>

31
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I love Yellow York</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be Irish in 2010,</v>

32
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:22.281
<v Speaker 1>2010.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a.</v>

33
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 1>There is a pride in our</v>

34
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.370
<v Speaker 1>that that that's happened in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual accomplishments and our</v>

35
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>literary accomplishments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishments in our technological</v>

36
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.660
<v Speaker 1>accomplishments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here to for a after,</v>

37
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.020
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>800 years of occupation and the function</v>

38
00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:58.071
<v Speaker 1>of the oppressor is to assure you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are nothing,</v>

39
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>that you're nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're less than deserving of</v>

40
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:07.640
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you are a piece of shit and I'm</v>

41
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.810
<v Speaker 1>don't aspire to anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they infuse you with with shame,</v>

42
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.970
<v Speaker 1>which has to do with the past because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the all shamans based family in the</v>

43
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to do with what you have done,</v>

44
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.980
<v Speaker 1>what you thought you will have done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ad Wants has sometimes seamus and juiced</v>

45
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:37.261
<v Speaker 1>by what has been done to you and by</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing things to be done to you,</v>

46
00:03:38.931 --> 00:03:43.931
<v Speaker 1>you are ashamed of not resisting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one part of a of oppression is</v>

47
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>to make sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure you're a shameful,</v>

48
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.920
<v Speaker 1>shamed human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a then on the other,</v>

49
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 1>and that takes care of the past and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future has to do with fear.</v>

50
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Don't attempt to come up here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't attempt to go forward.</v>

51
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were nobody.</v>

52
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>You are nobody and you'll always be</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

53
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.800
<v Speaker 1>So don't even think about coming here</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you do something awful will</v>

54
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:20.170
<v Speaker 1>happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were,</v>

55
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.130
<v Speaker 1>we were caught between the two demons to</v>
<v Speaker 1>devil's shame and fear,</v>

56
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.960
<v Speaker 1>and we couldn't deal with the present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was that we are indeed as</v>

57
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 1>accomplished in our own minds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as spiritual,</v>

58
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>as any other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as good as any other people.</v>

59
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could not look in the mirror.</v>

60
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:51.580
<v Speaker 1>I never said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we are.</v>

61
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.390
<v Speaker 1>So to be Irish today is the abandonment</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that shame and the younger people are</v>

62
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:04.750
<v Speaker 1>moving it out and they're moving the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear away.</v>

63
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:06.520
<v Speaker 1>They're not afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're adventurous,</v>

64
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:10.450
<v Speaker 1>they're going about the world as a care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not carefree,</v>

65
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 1>carefree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

66
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.140
<v Speaker 1>But as with confidence and with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>with the knowledge of the language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the education,</v>

68
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.490
<v Speaker 1>linguistically capable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poetic and fun,</v>

69
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>loving with a love of song and of life</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

70
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.560
<v Speaker 1>So that for the younger people to be is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

71
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a great,</v>

72
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.690
<v Speaker 1>this wonderful thing that is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The older ones of my generation are,</v>

73
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in infused with.</v>

74
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.940
<v Speaker 1>They're still have the fear and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>various</v>

75
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.180
<v Speaker 1>ethnic groups have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have diseases that are peculiar to their</v>

76
00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for example,</v>

77
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Jewish people have a taste sacks and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>African Americans have sickle cell</v>

78
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 1>anemia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

79
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:09.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Irish disease was respectability and</v>

80
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>that infects them a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a,</v>

81
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:16.430
<v Speaker 1>what would somebody say was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would they say?</v>

82
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 1>What would the English say if you wore</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

83
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be that.</v>

84
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:23.500
<v Speaker 1>So consequently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the Irish poet a,</v>

85
00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 1>he said you eventually become the thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hate the most.</v>

86
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 1>That's why so many of these Yahoos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly the ones that run the</v>

87
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:34.970
<v Speaker 1>center St Patrick's Day parade are</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives.</v>

88
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.240
<v Speaker 1>And that conservatism is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not a political ideology.</v>

89
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.240
<v Speaker 1>It is a form severe form of brain damage</v>
<v Speaker 1>for which has hardly any cure.</v>

90
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

91
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.210
<v Speaker 1>what we can do with them as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are gradually moving out.</v>

92
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:57.230
<v Speaker 1>The younger folks have taken over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some day there may be some culture in</v>

93
00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:02.240
<v Speaker 1>this St Patrick's Day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I prefer if it were an Irish parade</v>

94
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.130
<v Speaker 1>like Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel has a as a,</v>

95
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.850
<v Speaker 1>a parade that's Israel not devoted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moses or Abraham or Moses and Abraham.</v>

96
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.290
<v Speaker 1>And so I'd like to see the day when this</v>
<v Speaker 1>was an Irish because you can't be grand</v>

97
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:23.291
<v Speaker 1>marshal of this charade if you're not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Catholic.</v>

98
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 1>And they say a practicing Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

99
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these guys are hypocrites when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are about,</v>

100
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.930
<v Speaker 1>they're about as a practicing as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I am.</v>

101
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:41.050
<v Speaker 1>And I don't certainly am not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the whole thing myself.</v>

102
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.360
<v Speaker 1>But they are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hypocritical anyway,</v>

103
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.750
<v Speaker 1>and I hope that one day it will be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>IRA would be nourished,</v>

104
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 1>prayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I would march future.</v>

105
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 1>If you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have one foot in the future and</v>

106
00:07:57.561 --> 00:08:00.500
<v Speaker 1>one foot in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pissing on the present.</v>

107
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:03.050
<v Speaker 1>So I stay in the present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know about the future.</v>
