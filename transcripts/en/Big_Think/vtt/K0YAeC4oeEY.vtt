1
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.600
<v Speaker 1>We launched the Parkinson's initiative</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Michael J,</v>

2
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Fox and the Parkinson's institute in out</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

3
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>and we have individuals with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parkinson's.</v>

4
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>We're given a discounted version of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>23 and me,</v>

5
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>so we've designed the 23 and me site so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that individuals can get access to their</v>

6
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can fill out surveys specifically</v>

7
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>about Parkinson's as well as about their</v>
<v Speaker 1>general health,</v>

8
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they get all the other access,</v>

9
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>so in information about their ancestry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can connect and share with</v>

10
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a community portion they can</v>

11
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:43.020
<v Speaker 1>learn from people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we want to have a really engaging</v>

12
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:46.410
<v Speaker 1>experience for people so that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep getting information from them.</v>

13
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.860
<v Speaker 1>So we have one Parkinson survey now we</v>
<v Speaker 1>will plan to have additional Parkinson</v>

14
00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>surveys because the longterm goal is how</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I get information about you today,</v>

15
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 1>but let's say I want to know how does</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Parkinson's progress in 12 months</v>

16
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>in 24 months and 48 months because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>information will be really valuable to</v>

17
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 1>correlate with your genetic information.</v>

18
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>So then comes in 23 and we on the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

19
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>our researchers in house are actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyzing all the data,</v>

20
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>so all the information that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>collecting through the surveys,</v>

21
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>they then compare with the genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>information and what we're finding is</v>

22
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>we're actually making really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>discoveries.</v>

23
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>So I'm on all the different questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're asking about.</v>

24
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>So we'll hope to announce soon</v>
<v Speaker 1>information about,</v>

25
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because as Parkinson's community came</v>

26
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are some of the discoveries that we</v>

27
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>have made and what are those</v>
<v Speaker 1>discoveries,</v>

28
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 1>what kinds of discoveries will benefit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that community.</v>

29
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>So that might also integrate with a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the clinical trials that are</v>

30
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>happening where clinical trials are</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

31
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either on drugs where we can potentially</v>

32
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>help figure out why some people respond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people don't respond what,</v>

33
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.100
<v Speaker 1>where there's toxicity or toxicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>and some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the Parkinson's patients are</v>

35
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>eager to participate in clinical trials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we might be able to help make sure</v>

36
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Speaker 1>that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can find a clinical trial that</v>

37
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:03.144
<v Speaker 1>makes sense for them.</v>

38
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.640
<v Speaker 1>I think the biggest problem in clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>trials is that they're underpowered and</v>

39
00:02:10.641 --> 00:02:14.210
<v Speaker 1>that fundamentally the studies are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>too small and they're designed in such a</v>

40
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:16.850
<v Speaker 1>way because they're so expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're designed in such a way that</v>

41
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:20.090
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a small cushion and so,</v>

42
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're expensive to run if you need,</v>

43
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.940
<v Speaker 1>if you need a thousand patients to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really get the clinic the power that</v>

44
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:27.920
<v Speaker 1>you're looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have 1100.</v>

45
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what we're finding is that those</v>

46
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.860
<v Speaker 1>actually are still under powered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the advantage of 23 and me that we</v>

47
00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:37.730
<v Speaker 1>can do is we can actually have huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>datasets where we're not looking to</v>

48
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:38.451
<v Speaker 1>collect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:42.170
<v Speaker 1>100 people with cancer or a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>people with multiple sclerosis.</v>

50
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.450
<v Speaker 1>We want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.100
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Parkinson's initiative,</v>

52
00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:46.701
<v Speaker 1>we've announced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:49.310
<v Speaker 1>we have over 3000 people with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parkinson's in it,</v>

54
00:02:49.311 --> 00:02:50.540
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.360
<v Speaker 1>on a relative basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the largest cohorts out there</v>

56
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:53.930
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

57
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.740
<v Speaker 1>So we're looking to develop these large</v>
<v Speaker 1>cohorts and keep asking questions.</v>

58
00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the other advantages that</v>

59
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>we have is that we can ask these</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parkinson's patients about their</v>

60
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Parkinson's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're also learning about all these</v>

61
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>other aspects of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we asked the general health survey</v>

62
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 1>and then we're asking you about commonly</v>
<v Speaker 1>used drugs,</v>

63
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:11.471
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 1>do they get a stomach ache when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>take advil,</v>

65
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 1>how do they respond to Benadryl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

66
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's a cohort where we can keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning more and more things from them.</v>

67
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>I think we're very focused on</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing,</v>

68
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or understanding the relationship</v>

69
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 1>between genetics and drug response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that could be either on the</v>

70
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>efficacy side or the safety side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

71
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a well known studies that have come</v>

72
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 1>out that said 50 percent of all drugs</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we take to have no effect on you.</v>

73
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>So what we would like to understand is</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're given a drug is going to</v>

74
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:42.580
<v Speaker 1>respond yes or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and is it going to be safe,</v>

75
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 1>yes or no?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's going to be a critical</v>

76
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:45.860
<v Speaker 1>mission of 23.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And me.</v>
