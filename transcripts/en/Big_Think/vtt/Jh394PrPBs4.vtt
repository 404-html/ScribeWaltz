1
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a long story.</v>

2
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.090
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I was in retailing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to city college and I went to fit</v>

4
00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:19.850
<v Speaker 1>and I was in retailing for awhile and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was working for a company called gimbals</v>

5
00:00:19.851 --> 00:00:23.480
<v Speaker 1>in New York City and they were going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>close shop.</v>

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.930
<v Speaker 1>They sold the real estate here right</v>
<v Speaker 1>here on 33rd and Broadway and I was out</v>

7
00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:30.140
<v Speaker 1>of a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

8
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.561
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:32.540
<v Speaker 1>I've always been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I've been working since I'm 16</v>

10
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:34.880
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said I was married at the time and I</v>

11
00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>was able to take some time off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I took some time off and some friends</v>

12
00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:41.570
<v Speaker 1>of mindset to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's open a cabaret.</v>

13
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.501
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

14
00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:46.250
<v Speaker 1>that might be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we opened this cabaret on Eighth</v>

15
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Avenue and 26th street and they named a</v>
<v Speaker 1>caroline's.</v>

16
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once my name was on the door,</v>

17
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.720
<v Speaker 1>then I had a little more than invested</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in it.</v>

18
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.771
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

19
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:55.880
<v Speaker 1>this might be fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:59.090
<v Speaker 1>helping run this club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we started with lots of cabaret acts</v>

21
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.300
<v Speaker 1>and when that quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really didn't hit me.</v>

22
00:01:02.301 --> 00:01:04.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't contemporary enough for me at</v>

23
00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:07.010
<v Speaker 1>that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we started to book comedians like</v>

24
00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Jay Leno and Jerry Seinfeld and Garry</v>
<v Speaker 1>shandling and billy crystal and peewee</v>

25
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Herman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the start of,</v>

26
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.390
<v Speaker 1>of Caroline's as a comedy club.</v>

27
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

28
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>watching the David Letterman show that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on it,</v>

29
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>

30
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 1>30 at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

31
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Jay Leno was kind of a regular on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

32
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of Said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

33
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:31.720
<v Speaker 1>let me tie it into one if we can get him</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the show when he said Caroline's and</v>

34
00:01:31.721 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>he can mention that he's there and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>people come out to see him.</v>

35
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:38.280
<v Speaker 1>It was a way of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of saving with advertising,</v>

36
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>but getting the word out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was called marketing at that</v>

37
00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:44.490
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so kind of we did it that way and I kind</v>

38
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:49.491
<v Speaker 1>of built our reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a working comedian.</v>

39
00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Speaker 1>He worked around the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a small following at that time,</v>

40
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>but they came out to him and it was kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my contemporaries at the time.</v>

41
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Jay and I are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.050
<v Speaker 1>like the same age and his clientele was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same age as that time and,</v>

43
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.110
<v Speaker 1>and they came out to Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed by people that were on the rise</v>

44
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Speaker 1>like Jerry Seinfeld and Garry shandling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sandra Bernhard,</v>

45
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.560
<v Speaker 1>Rita rudner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

46
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:19.070
<v Speaker 1>it's everybody that's kind of made it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came through the club</v>

47
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.063
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

48
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I think I was talking to an agent at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that time at Apa and Jerry was there and</v>

49
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:29.751
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

50
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:31.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agents are always trying to sell you a</v>

51
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.940
<v Speaker 1>so talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

52
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:36.350
<v Speaker 1>so he suggested that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we booked Jerry and we did A.</v>

53
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Jerry worked at the club for a number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and I remember him doing a few new</v>

54
00:02:40.011 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 1>year's eves there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was Kinda fun years ago.</v>

55
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people came through our</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

56
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:50.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

57
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:52.680
<v Speaker 1>there were a lot of people where we had</v>
<v Speaker 1>them as we,</v>

58
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>we put them as opening acts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

59
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Rock was a young kid when he</v>

60
00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>started to work at the club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

61
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.030
<v Speaker 1>and when he last appeared at a club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a,</v>

62
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>a young comedian called Wanda Sykes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wanda,</v>

63

<v Speaker 1>we put wander as an opening act and</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced to the Chris and after that,</v>

64
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>her career was made and she worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She worked a lot with Chris with Chris</v>

66
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I take it for granted.</v>

67
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>The people have come through there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean lots of producers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
