1
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.470
<v Speaker 2>well if I were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give you that answer of course,</v>

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.220
<v Speaker 2>but it was Charles Darwin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you another answer and in fact</v>

4
00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:17.810
<v Speaker 2>if I was Adam Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd give you a third.</v>

5
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Will have too many answers for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the mechanical era sort of obviated</v>

6
00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:27.560
<v Speaker 2>the need for doomsday predictions with</v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to out of control populations</v>

7
00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:30.920
<v Speaker 2>because every time it appeared that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't do anything more,</v>

8
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:34.000
<v Speaker 2>we could do something more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had the first green revolutions,</v>

9
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.250
<v Speaker 2>which I just talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second green revolution came when it</v>

10
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.700
<v Speaker 2>became obvious that if you don't start</v>
<v Speaker 2>fertilizing the ground with her</v>

11
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.220
<v Speaker 2>fertilizers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with food and supplements,</v>

12
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:46.130
<v Speaker 2>I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if we don't start trying to get rid</v>

13
00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:49.940
<v Speaker 2>of the competitor species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>namely the weeds with herbicides and,</v>

14
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.160
<v Speaker 2>and also the pests that want to eat this</v>
<v Speaker 2>crop,</v>

15
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.050
<v Speaker 2>that we can now grow to two profusion as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the result of the invention of dynamite.</v>

16
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.460
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

17
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it allowed us to clear the</v>

18
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:02.960
<v Speaker 2>fields of all those rotten little trees</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we had to get rid of.</v>

19
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.290
<v Speaker 2>So too bad because we could use those</v>
<v Speaker 2>trees again.</v>

20
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we now find ourselves in another dilemma</v>

21
00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:14.420
<v Speaker 2>where we think the population will peak</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the food supply will dwindle.</v>

22
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.500
<v Speaker 2>So once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in a Malthusian a mind game.</v>

23
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that whatever problem is</v>

24
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:26.300
<v Speaker 2>presented to the human species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got such a big cerebral cortex.</v>

25
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.800
<v Speaker 2>We can solve it if we all agree to and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

26
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 2>that's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we want to solve the next problem to</v>

27
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.640
<v Speaker 2>usher in the third green revolution?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second one was all of those</v>

28
00:01:37.641 --> 00:01:39.890
<v Speaker 2>pesticides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>herbicides and fertilizer things,</v>

29
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.220
<v Speaker 2>plus not genetically modified foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly a highly selected foods.</v>

30
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:47.930
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at our food since day,</v>

31
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.220
<v Speaker 2>virtually every crop that's grown</v>
<v Speaker 2>originated from some wild plant that you</v>

32
00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:53.300
<v Speaker 2>would not recognize.</v>

33
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.550
<v Speaker 2>An apple is about the size of a pea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It started out in the middle of Russia</v>

34
00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 2>someplace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you took a bite of it,</v>

35
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:02.240
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be able to eat for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mouth will be closed.</v>

36
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.540
<v Speaker 2>It's so sour that you wouldn't believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that someone would actually want to eat</v>

37
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:09.050
<v Speaker 2>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet domestication of that plant has</v>

38
00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:10.970
<v Speaker 2>now resulted in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>

39
00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:15.971
<v Speaker 2>20,000 different varieties of apples</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a single unit plant.</v>

40
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.650
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you look at wheat,</v>

41
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.210
<v Speaker 2>it's been the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at rice,</v>

42
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:23.630
<v Speaker 2>it's been the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been marvelous at selecting crops</v>

43
00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:28.460
<v Speaker 2>to fit into climates that are suited for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the optimum growth of those plants,</v>

44
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.250
<v Speaker 2>but what was there before?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the point there.</v>

45
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 2>There was a natural ecosystem there</v>
<v Speaker 2>before we planted those.</v>
