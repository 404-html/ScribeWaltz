1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.760
<v Speaker 1>My name is Eric Hippeau,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a venture capitalists.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.150
<v Speaker 1>My firm is called Larry Hippeau ventures</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's me plus three other partners.</v>

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>We are technology investors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we look for companies that use</v>

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily consumer technology.</v>

5
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that they have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumer facing,</v>

6
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>but the technology has to be based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same technology that we all use day</v>

7
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:24.830
<v Speaker 1>to day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>and so we're looking for companies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>use technology to either create large</v>

9
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:33.120
<v Speaker 1>new marketplaces or large new</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses,</v>

10
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or who disrupt a large businesses that</v>

11
00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:40.240
<v Speaker 1>are already in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.320
<v Speaker 1>and New York is particularly well suited</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this because there's a lot of people</v>

13
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>with very diverse backgrounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diverse domain knowledge.</v>

14
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot of people in the,</v>

15
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>in our educational system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a million kids in our public school</v>

16
00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$600,000 car students,</v>

17
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and technology today is primarily</v>

18
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>developed in large urban centers.</v>

19
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>So obviously New York is well positioned</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

20
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.870
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference between New York and</v>

21
00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:14.871
<v Speaker 1>Silicon Valley is in the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology that people that we develop</v>

22
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>here as opposed to in Silicon Valley</v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

23
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>I think we should point out where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>similarities are and the similarities</v>

24
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:28.041
<v Speaker 1>are that because technology today is</v>
<v Speaker 1>transportable and rentable and</v>

25
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.710
<v Speaker 1>relatively cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 1>to use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>we in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it could be anywhere,</v>

29
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>it could be Bombay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be Austin,</v>

30
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.280
<v Speaker 1>have access to the same technology to</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop new applications,</v>

31
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>new services than anybody in Silicon</v>
<v Speaker 1>Valley.</v>

32
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.660
<v Speaker 1>So everyone starts with the same level</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing field.</v>

33
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>The technology is accessible through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cloud.</v>

34
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.760
<v Speaker 1>It's rentable through the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can start a company with a</v>

35
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

36
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of laptops and a two or three people and</v>

37
00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 1>you have an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few thousand dollars literally,</v>

38
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>and you can start a company and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>start a business.</v>

39
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.230
<v Speaker 1>So it's very different today than it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a few years ago where a large part</v>

40
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:14.010
<v Speaker 1>of the money that you raised actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to the acquisition of the</v>

41
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:16.170
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to buy servers and you have to</v>

42
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>buy hardware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to buy expensive software</v>

43
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>licenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And today you don't have to do any of</v>

44
00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big difference.</v>

45
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:24.234
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

46
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.570
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have in New York as,</v>

47
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:27.404
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

48
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 1>as anywhere else access to the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>latest developments in technology than</v>

49
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>anybody in Silicon Valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big differences that New York</v>

50
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>focuses more on the software layer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the application and the services</v>

51
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>layer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.990
<v Speaker 1>so that we're really good at software,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York.</v>

53
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:46.591
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

54
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:47.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're good at,</v>

55
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at platforms.</v>

56
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>We're good at consumer facing</v>
<v Speaker 1>application.</v>

57
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:53.440
<v Speaker 1>We're good at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>enterprise software,</v>
<v Speaker 1>software as a service.</v>

59
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>We're good at a variety of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>domains,</v>

60
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>obviously are the ones that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of the traditional sectors such as</v>

61
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.990
<v Speaker 1>advertising and media and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also healthcare and a variety of</v>

62
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:16.981
<v Speaker 1>different domains where you have people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have experience and expertise,</v>

63
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they know some big companies are</v>

64
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>located here and big sectors of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy or are based here.</v>

65
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>What New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

66
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>it's probably not going to do is develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next plumbing for the Internet.</v>

67
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>That's more likely to be a coming out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the west coast.</v>

68
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>But having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're increasingly getting more and more</v>

69
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>advanced engineering talent are in New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>

70
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.180
<v Speaker 1>on Roosevelt Island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a cornell university</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

73
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:54.871
<v Speaker 1>in conjunction with the big technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>institute in Israel are building a</v>

74
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>campus and which will be ready in two or</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years,</v>

75
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:03.880
<v Speaker 1>but the classes have already started in</v>
<v Speaker 1>other locations and this is all going to</v>

76
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 1>be advanced applied engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who knows what's going to develop in</v>

77
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:11.140
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some hardware is already being developed</v>

78
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:12.760
<v Speaker 1>in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We invest investors,</v>

79
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Makerbot,</v>

80
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 1>the three d printer company that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>sold recently to,</v>

81
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:18.574
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

82
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 1>another three d printer company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

83
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there is a,</v>

84
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.540
<v Speaker 1>there is a background in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in hardware and manufacturing in New</v>

85
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 1>York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generally speaking,</v>

86
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 1>it's really software that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

87
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big thing as it were healing.</v>
