1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:00.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.070
<v Speaker 2>that we had a big party and lab had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of reporters came to get comments</v>

3
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:17.840
<v Speaker 2>from people at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.760
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really excited and because at</v>

5
00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard has a lot of private funding and</v>

6
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 2>so it's so some labs have projects that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are less dependent on federal funding,</v>

7
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.830
<v Speaker 2>but I think that lots of people in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>US,</v>

8
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 2>there's thousands of universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of which are very bright people</v>

9
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.430
<v Speaker 2>trying to advance stem cell research and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that blockading federal money to those</v>

10
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 2>lab of toys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Villi hurts us a lot because we can't</v>

11
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:54.130
<v Speaker 2>hope to bring queues into market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think by just having pilot funding to</v>

12
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 2>universities and corporate funding for</v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceuticals and that I'm really</v>

13
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 2>excited now that our current president</v>
<v Speaker 2>is looking forward to trying to um,</v>

14
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 2>jumpstart stem cell research and</v>
<v Speaker 2>biomedical research as whole.</v>

15
00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 2>And I think that</v>

16
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.740
<v Speaker 2>as this money gets spread around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

17
00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:16.910
<v Speaker 2>that we will see a lot of people from</v>
<v Speaker 2>different universities and institutions</v>

18
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:19.550
<v Speaker 2>publishing a lot of good work that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really going to move us forward.</v>

19
00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:21.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm really excited that this is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

20
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I think that while the first FDA trials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical trials for stamps was a going</v>

21
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:31.900
<v Speaker 2>on now with spinal cord injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

22
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 2>that many of my colleagues and friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I agree that it will be decades</v>

23
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 2>before this becomes a more prevalent</v>
<v Speaker 2>trend.</v>

24
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 2>And I think that looking at the current,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

25
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 2>current drugs for pharmaceutical</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>

26
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.450
<v Speaker 2>it can take maybe on a scale of 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a billion dollars to get a drug all</v>

27
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 2>the way to market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that means that for the</v>

28
00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:58.560
<v Speaker 2>stem cell studies are being done it now</v>
<v Speaker 2>in mice,</v>

29
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 2>that it will take at least at the very</v>
<v Speaker 2>minimum,</v>

30
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 2>a decade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more to be able to get those to</v>

31
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:05.604
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

32
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 2>I think the fact is we're so comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 2>with taking pills or taking shots,</v>

33
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 2>but</v>
<v Speaker 2>when gene therapy came around,</v>

34
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 2>no one was too excited about putting</v>
<v Speaker 2>viruses into the body.</v>

35
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 2>And I think that right now people aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>too thrilled about putting stem cells</v>

36
00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:22.560
<v Speaker 2>with stem cell derived cells into</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's body.</v>

37
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 2>And I think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really important that we try to</v>

38
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 2>take this slow and be careful and make</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure that nothing that we can</v>

39
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 2>ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hi a person,</v>

40
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.620
<v Speaker 2>that these stem cells won't hurt anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it definitely will take</v>

41
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I guess maybe as my generation gets</v>

42
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:43.820
<v Speaker 2>older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll see stem cells come around because</v>

43
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 2>there's a big interest in them and lots</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people interested.</v>

44
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.710
<v Speaker 2>But I think that it's something in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>near foreseeable future but not but</v>

45
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 2>definitely not now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that the future was definitely going</v>

46
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 2>to bring a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm really excited to see how it.</v>
