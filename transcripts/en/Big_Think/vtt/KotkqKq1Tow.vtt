00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.153
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hi bill.</v>

3
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.410
<v Speaker 2>My name is [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>My question is about giving some chance</v>

4
00:00:08.411 --> 00:00:10.570
<v Speaker 2>to the chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.360
<v Speaker 2>the power ability of winning a lottery</v>
<v Speaker 2>is very,</v>

6
00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:15.430
<v Speaker 2>very small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevertheless,</v>

7
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.760
<v Speaker 2>it's playing lottery rational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

8
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.760
<v Speaker 3>The lottery Uri,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uri,</v>

9
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.320
<v Speaker 3>Uri,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to tell you when I first I,</v>

10
00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:28.900
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't sound like you're in the u s</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in the u s and I lived in</v>

11
00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:31.600
<v Speaker 3>Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington for a while now Washington in</v>

12
00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:36.010
<v Speaker 3>the United States as a western state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has old traditions and the big thing</v>

13
00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:40.780
<v Speaker 3>is it's not as populated as other states</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the u s and there was a lottery.</v>

14
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.770
<v Speaker 3>There is a lottery and they used to</v>
<v Speaker 3>think it was kind of charming and people</v>

15
00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:47.320
<v Speaker 3>want to play the lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'll be fun for them.</v>

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.670
<v Speaker 3>The chances of winning are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very small,</v>

18
00:00:51.671 --> 00:00:55.030
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost everyone who ever plays ever</v>

19
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.810
<v Speaker 3>loses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he used to think it was benign or</v>

20
00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:01.420
<v Speaker 3>not any big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I have changed my mind about that</v>

21
00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:06.421
<v Speaker 3>over the last 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lottery is mostly a tax on people</v>

22
00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:08.020
<v Speaker 3>who don't know math.</v>

23
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.090
<v Speaker 3>And the reason they don't know math is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people like me have failed to</v>

24
00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:16.120
<v Speaker 3>enlighten people on what it really</v>
<v Speaker 3>means.</v>

25
00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:20.650
<v Speaker 3>When it's one and 230 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it means you will lose.</v>

26
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.650
<v Speaker 3>That's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a one in 230 million chance</v>

27
00:01:23.651 --> 00:01:25.240
<v Speaker 3>of winning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it means you will lose.</v>

28
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.210
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was doing standup comedy,</v>

29
00:01:28.211 --> 00:01:33.211
<v Speaker 3>I used to have a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a joke about having a revolver,</v>

30
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.820
<v Speaker 3>a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the bullets are arranged in a</v>

31
00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:40.120
<v Speaker 3>circle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know your ancestor Uri,</v>

32
00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:44.890
<v Speaker 3>but you might be from uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the eastern bloc countries in</v>

33
00:01:44.891 --> 00:01:47.800
<v Speaker 3>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we have an expression in the United</v>

34
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.910
<v Speaker 3>States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russian roulette,</v>

35
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 3>where there's one bullet in the gun and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you spin it and then you hold it to your</v>

36
00:01:53.741 --> 00:01:58.180
<v Speaker 3>head and see whether or not you'll die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a one in six chance</v>

37
00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:01.150
<v Speaker 3>traditionally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the lottery it's one and 230</v>

38
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.800
<v Speaker 3>million or 450 million.</v>

39
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 3>So imagine a gun with 449 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>999,000,</v>

40
00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:15.841
<v Speaker 3>999 bullets in it and one empty chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would not hold that to your head for</v>

41
00:02:17.621 --> 00:02:22.621
<v Speaker 3>$2 ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I feel bad that uh,</v>

42
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 3>the people who play the lottery are</v>
<v Speaker 3>generally people with lower education</v>

43
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.210
<v Speaker 3>and lower incomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

44
00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:36.211
<v Speaker 3>these are statistical facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we are accidentally taxing people who</v>

45
00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:40.120
<v Speaker 3>can least afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's frustrating for me as a science</v>

46
00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:41.930
<v Speaker 3>educator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

47
00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:43.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my advice to you is don't play the</v>

48
00:02:43.811 --> 00:02:46.750
<v Speaker 3>lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Use your dollars for something else.</v>

49
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.890
<v Speaker 3>And if you do play the lottery a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand you get some pleasure out</v>

50
00:02:50.891 --> 00:02:53.470
<v Speaker 3>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but keep in mind you almost always lose</v>

51
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.550
<v Speaker 3>and wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's more to it that it preys on this</v>

52
00:02:57.551 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 3>other aspect of nature where we embrace</v>
<v Speaker 3>the successes and forget about the</v>

53
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 3>losses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how psychics make their living</v>

54
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 3>palm readers and so on that you remember</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they accidentally said the right</v>

55
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 3>thing and you forget when they said</v>
<v Speaker 3>dozens of wrong things.</v>

56
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 3>So people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they bet a dollar and they win a $5</v>

57
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 3>lottery ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$5 reward,</v>

58
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.300
<v Speaker 3>they almost always reinvest that $5 or</v>
<v Speaker 3>the $4 to buy more lottery tickets.</v>

59
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like a cool idea.</v>

60
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 3>And now in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's huge state incomes based on</v>

61
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 3>lotteries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the biggest sense,</v>

62
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 3>it is a tax on the people who can least</v>
<v Speaker 3>afford it.</v>

63
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 3>It's frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm frustrated.</v>

64
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for asking that question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eri.</v>

65
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.490
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
