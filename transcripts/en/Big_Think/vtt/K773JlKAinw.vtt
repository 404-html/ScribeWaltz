1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.520
<v Speaker 2>nuclear power nuclear power that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

3
00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:14.920
<v Speaker 2>it's called second generation nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

4
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>

5
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 2>it's a comparable in cost to coal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you have the nuclear power plant,</v>

6
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 2>then the fuel is very inexpensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so nuclear power is quite inexpensive,</v>

7
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's difficult in the United States</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get a nuclear power plant and build</v>

8
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.200
<v Speaker 2>and it takes so many years that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>drives the cost up.</v>

9
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.720
<v Speaker 2>So now in England they've realized that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will need to have nuclear power in</v>

10
00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:50.110
<v Speaker 2>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they've put a limit once a government</v>

11
00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 2>commission decides on where the power</v>
<v Speaker 2>plants will be built,</v>

12
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.390
<v Speaker 2>the public will have one year to object</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this and possibly get some changes,</v>

13
00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:02.650
<v Speaker 2>but they can't drag it out six or seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>years the way it happens in the United</v>

14
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.980
<v Speaker 2>States because that drives up the price</v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendously.</v>

15
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 2>And there's also the possibility for</v>
<v Speaker 2>fourth generation nuclear power.</v>

16
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Speaker 2>That's a technology which allows you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>burn all of the nuclear fuel.</v>

17
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.300
<v Speaker 2>Presently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear power plants burn less than one</v>

18
00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:25.540
<v Speaker 2>percent of the energy in the nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuel.</v>

19
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Fourth generation nuclear power allows</v>
<v Speaker 2>the neutrons to move faster so they can</v>

20
00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:36.601
<v Speaker 2>burn all of the fuel and furthermore it</v>
<v Speaker 2>can burn nuclear waste so it can solve</v>

21
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.860
<v Speaker 2>the nuclear waste problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the United States is still the</v>

22
00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:49.801
<v Speaker 2>technology leader in fourth generation</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear power in 1994 Argonne National</v>

23
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Laboratory now called Idaho National</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laboratory was ready to build a fourth</v>

24
00:01:56.741 --> 00:02:01.510
<v Speaker 2>generation nuclear power plant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Clinton Gore administration</v>

25
00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:06.511
<v Speaker 2>canceled that research because of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti nuclear sentiments in the</v>

26
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Democratic Party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

27
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are still have the best expertise in</v>

28
00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:17.650
<v Speaker 2>that technology and we should develop it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's something that we could</v>

29
00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:19.390
<v Speaker 2>also sell to China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>India,</v>

30
00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:21.340
<v Speaker 2>because they're going to need nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

31
00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:24.640
<v Speaker 2>They don't are not going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get all of their energy from the sun and</v>

32
00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:25.474
<v Speaker 2>from the wind.</v>

33
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.670
<v Speaker 2>The most effective one is energy</v>
<v Speaker 2>efficiency.</v>

34
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.160
<v Speaker 2>We waste a lot of our energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can get vehicles that get more miles</v>

35
00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:41.090
<v Speaker 2>per gallon there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are many ways to improve energy</v>

36
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:42.740
<v Speaker 2>efficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

37
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.550
<v Speaker 2>some states are twice as efficient as</v>
<v Speaker 2>other states.</v>

38
00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Just because fossil fuels were so cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just didn't pay attention to how</v>

39
00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:54.050
<v Speaker 2>effectively we were using them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in addition,</v>

40
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:56.180
<v Speaker 2>they're renewable energies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>solar energy,</v>

41
00:02:56.181 --> 00:03:01.181
<v Speaker 2>wind energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that nuclear power has to be</v>

42
00:03:01.671 --> 00:03:06.671
<v Speaker 2>part of the solution because at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>time it's the only alternative to coal</v>

43
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 2>for baseload electrical power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we do now have the technology for a</v>

44
00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:20.261
<v Speaker 2>much safer and more efficient nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 2>power as compared to the old versions</v>

45
00:03:21.321 --> 00:03:23.330
<v Speaker 2>that were used in the past several</v>
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>
