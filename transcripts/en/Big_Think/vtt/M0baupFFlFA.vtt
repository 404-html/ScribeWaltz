1
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I happened to be a fan of democracy.</v>

2
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it has flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was just no other better</v>

3
00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:17.660
<v Speaker 1>system for one simple reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is you can often get a bit</v>

4
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.560
<v Speaker 1>inefficient dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people think that Lee Kuan Yew</v>

5
00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:22.930
<v Speaker 1>in Singapore was such a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was not corrupt.</v>

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.990
<v Speaker 1>He actually alleviated a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic conflict.</v>

7
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.190
<v Speaker 1>But here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could never ensure that the dictator</v>

8
00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:34.690
<v Speaker 1>will stay beneficence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the better thing about democracy is</v>

9
00:00:34.691 --> 00:00:38.650
<v Speaker 1>that eventually you can vote them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't like the policies.</v>

10
00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:40.960
<v Speaker 1>If you don't like the leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can vote them out.</v>

11
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.170
<v Speaker 1>So on balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that democracy is the best</v>

12
00:00:44.171 --> 00:00:47.770
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I think is wrong is that America</v>

13
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.640
<v Speaker 1>treats democracy like a panacea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We romanticize it.</v>

14
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.530
<v Speaker 1>We think somehow that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

15
00:00:53.531 --> 00:00:57.850
<v Speaker 1>there's all this civil war and tribalism</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sectarian warfare there.</v>

16
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Let's just have some elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they don't realize is that in very</v>

17
00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:05.350
<v Speaker 1>divided countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnically divided,</v>

18
00:01:05.351 --> 00:01:10.351
<v Speaker 1>tribally divided democracy can sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalize group conflict rather than</v>

19
00:01:11.411 --> 00:01:15.540
<v Speaker 1>softening it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people have puzzled over how so</v>

20
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.380
<v Speaker 1>many blue collar and working class</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans could possibly have voted for</v>

21
00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:24.220
<v Speaker 1>a billionaire born to wealth born in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan,</v>

22
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually not a puzzle at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a lot of working class Americans</v>

23
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.650
<v Speaker 1>resent is the idea that there's a rigged</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

24
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.300
<v Speaker 1>that there are these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogant people controlling the leavers</v>

25
00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:40.570
<v Speaker 1>of power from afar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in DC and on Wall Street and</v>

26
00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Silicon Valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the surveys,</v>

27
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Pew Foundation Studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find that most Americans,</v>

28
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.280
<v Speaker 1>including working class Americans</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually love capitalism.</v>

29
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.880
<v Speaker 1>They don't want socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still want a system where you could</v>

30
00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:57.220
<v Speaker 1>work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can strike it rich,</v>

31
00:01:57.221 --> 00:01:59.740
<v Speaker 1>and they want it to be fine to be rich.</v>

32
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Study show that many working class</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans actually resent the</v>

33
00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:08.080
<v Speaker 1>professional elites bore the very</v>
<v Speaker 1>polished,</v>

34
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.120
<v Speaker 1>well-educated snobby professors and</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists and pundits speaking on TV</v>

35
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.250
<v Speaker 1>and that they don't actually dislike the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kardashians so much,</v>

36
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.160
<v Speaker 1>or the billionaires that are jet setting</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

37
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.340
<v Speaker 1>That's why shows like the apprentice are</v>
<v Speaker 1>so popular.</v>

38
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.400
<v Speaker 1>The occupy movement in many important</v>
<v Speaker 1>things highlighting the urgency of</v>

39
00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:33.610
<v Speaker 1>inequality in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one problem with the occupy movement</v>

40
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.410
<v Speaker 1>is that it was a movement that purported</v>
<v Speaker 1>to want to help the poor that didn't</v>

41
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.930
<v Speaker 1>actually include any members of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor.</v>

42
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.980
<v Speaker 1>It was overwhelmingly an extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>privileged movement,</v>

43
00:02:44.981 --> 00:02:49.981
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but highly educated and largely from</v>

44
00:02:50.201 --> 00:02:54.670
<v Speaker 1>cosmopolitan urban areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you look at the interviews of</v>

45
00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:57.850
<v Speaker 1>people from other parts of the country</v>
<v Speaker 1>working class people,</v>

46
00:02:57.851 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>blue collar people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that they didn't</v>

47
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>participate in these activist anti</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality movements.</v>

48
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>They actually were very suspicious of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and even a little scornful.</v>

49
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>The interviews have people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't these people have jobs?</v>

50
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Don't they have to work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working three jobs just to put food</v>

51
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can they be marching and protesting</v>

52
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

53
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>that's a little unfair because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these activists movements have done</v>

54
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 1>tremendous good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is also true that it is a</v>

55
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>privilege to have the time to take off</v>
<v Speaker 1>work and to do these things.</v>

56
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 1>So there's a real schism in group</v>
<v Speaker 1>identities.</v>

57
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>A lot of America's elites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they were campaigning for Bernie</v>

58
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 1>or hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't really connect with so many of</v>

59
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:47.221
<v Speaker 1>the lower income Americans because in</v>
<v Speaker 1>part they had a snobby view towards</v>

60
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is that a lot of America's</v>

61
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>political elites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the establishment elites,</v>

62
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.090
<v Speaker 1>just really didn't bother to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the people that supposedly</v>

63
00:03:58.091 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to help.</v>

64
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to contrast the occupied</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement with the Prosperity Gospel.</v>

65
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.330
<v Speaker 1>The irony is just glaring so occupy was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a movement championing supposedly the</v>

66
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:14.640
<v Speaker 1>underclasses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but largely driven by elites.</v>

67
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>The Prosperity Gospel is a hugely</v>
<v Speaker 1>popular movement in America.</v>

68
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 1>What are the most powerful religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>movements in the United States that is</v>

69
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.950
<v Speaker 1>very largely populated by disadvantaged</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>

70
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 1>including our most disadvantaged</v>
<v Speaker 1>minorities?</v>

71
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>African Americans and Hispanic Americans</v>
<v Speaker 1>are flocking to the Prosperity Gospel.</v>

72
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.940
<v Speaker 1>What is their creed that God blesses the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy,</v>

73
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 1>that being rich is divine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that if you pray for wealth hard</v>

74
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God will give it to you.</v>

75
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.500
<v Speaker 1>And this contrast just shows the tribal</v>
<v Speaker 1>chasm between America's haves and have</v>

76
00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:56.660
<v Speaker 1>nots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have people purporting to want to</v>

77
00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 1>help the other side and yet actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>scorning the very movements that those</v>

78
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:04.870
<v Speaker 1>people actually belong to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a strange relationship with</v>

79
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>celebrity culture in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in some ways you could see the</v>

80
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:13.471
<v Speaker 1>victory of Donald Trump as Donald Trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>tapping into this obsession with</v>

81
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>celebrities.</v>

82
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.290
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like he's created a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>billionaire populism where he's tapping</v>

83
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:25.240
<v Speaker 1>into this desire for a lot of working</v>
<v Speaker 1>class people to rise in a system where</v>

84
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 1>they can no longer rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's so much inequality that</v>

85
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:32.110
<v Speaker 1>they can't just make it with hard work</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they romanticize that.</v>

86
00:05:32.111 --> 00:05:32.944
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

87
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.910
<v Speaker 1>If I go on American idol or the voice or</v>
<v Speaker 1>shark tank,</v>

88
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe I can hit it big and they actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>glorify all the desperate housewives or</v>

89
00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 1>the Kardashians or the celebrity</v>
<v Speaker 1>musicians and actresses.</v>

90
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.470
<v Speaker 1>These are beloved figures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not hated it all.</v>

91
00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like the royal family in England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The desire for the American dream is so</v>

92
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 1>powerful that people will cling to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when they have no chance.</v>

93
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Even when the American dream turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>their backs on,</v>

94
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:07.721
<v Speaker 1>people mocks them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Americans would sooner turn on</v>

95
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 1>immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outsiders even reason itself.</v>

96
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Then turn on the American dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a lot of people think,</v>

97
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>why is this happening now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

98
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with our society?</v>

99
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always been there.</v>

100
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these issues have always been</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

101
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 1>There's always been a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these male bosses that have done these</v>

102
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like it's all happening now.</v>

103
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just that finally certain groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>voices are allowed to be heard.</v>

104
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.700
<v Speaker 1>It the same with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

105
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 1>a lot of diversity issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

106
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 1>people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why now are there so many minorities</v>

107
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 1>complaining on campuses or in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

108
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 1>it used to be so smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things used to work so well.</v>

109
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Well that's because so many voices used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be suppressed.</v>

110
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 1>So in a way I think it's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's often experienced as turbulence</v>

111
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 1>and chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

112
00:06:58.341 --> 00:07:02.240
<v Speaker 1>everything's going haywire is actually a</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

113
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.440
<v Speaker 1>a rising of certain voices that</v>
<v Speaker 1>historically have not been allowed to</v>

114
00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:08.570
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are lots of different groups.</v>

115
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a long all kinds of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>lines,</v>
