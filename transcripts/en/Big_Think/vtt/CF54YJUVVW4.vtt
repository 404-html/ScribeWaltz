1
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Clearly the price of oil has had an</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on the US economy,</v>

2
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 1>but it hasn't been pronounced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think as many people feared.</v>

3
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember back in 2002 economists were</v>

4
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:21.720
<v Speaker 1>spreading over their possibility of 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>or $50 oil.</v>

5
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Well now we're at a hundred dollar oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't like it,</v>

6
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.360
<v Speaker 1>but most of us can still afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.070
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely hurting a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making light of that and it's</v>

8
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.060
<v Speaker 1>definitely a lot of people who drive a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot truckers,</v>

9
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>they're feeling a big pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>but oil at $120,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that it will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>substantially different from oil at 100.</v>

12
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>the price of gasoline is going up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.761
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of other factors now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are coming into the price of crude,</v>

16
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>besides demand.</v>

17
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>And that is the falling value of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollar.</v>

18
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:53.304
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

19
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of speculators in the market now</v>

20
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>affecting the price of crude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

21
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>how much they increased price,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have what effect it will have.</v>

22
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't predict that.</v>

23
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.750
<v Speaker 2>Well I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

24
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.660
<v Speaker 1>theory anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the $5 a gallon price is one that people</v>

25
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.590
<v Speaker 1>often mention as one where huge amounts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of conservation people drive,</v>

26
00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:20.470
<v Speaker 1>we'll quit driving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll carpool or ride their bikes.</v>

27
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that makes some sense.</v>

28
00:01:23.471 --> 00:01:25.060
<v Speaker 1>But for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 1>I live in Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often have to drive to Houston.</v>

30
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if my choices are taking the bus or</v>

31
00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:34.030
<v Speaker 1>flying or driving myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still gonna probably buy $5 a gallon</v>

32
00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:35.200
<v Speaker 1>gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>

33
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

34
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.260
<v Speaker 1>as I recall about two thirds of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>transportation miles driven by</v>

35
00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:44.590
<v Speaker 1>civilians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non non commercial operators or people</v>

36
00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:48.610
<v Speaker 1>driving to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think even at $5 a lot of people</v>

37
00:01:48.611 --> 00:01:50.590
<v Speaker 1>are going to pay it because they have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to work.</v>

38
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.510
<v Speaker 1>So I think we haven't seen yet a price</v>
<v Speaker 1>high enough.</v>

39
00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:57.520
<v Speaker 1>I think for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>a lot of societal changes overall in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the end of the suburbs or so</v>

41
00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:04.540
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.620
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>we still see gasoline as a necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think for many people that still</v>

44
00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:12.100
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be for a long time to come.</v>

45
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:19.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
