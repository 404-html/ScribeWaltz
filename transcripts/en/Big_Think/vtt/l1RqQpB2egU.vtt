00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does that all the people are</v>

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.373
<v Speaker 1>automatically,</v>

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.430
<v Speaker 2>which is not true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only about 5% of older people,</v>

4
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.950
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a nursing obs with any kind of a</v>

5
00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:21.880
<v Speaker 2>dementia or Alzheimer's disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that they're unproductive and</v>

6
00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:25.660
<v Speaker 2>can't be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The workforce who may know their numbers</v>

7
00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:28.000
<v Speaker 2>of them that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're very dependable and</v>

8
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.850
<v Speaker 2>hardworking people in the workforce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea,</v>

9
00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:33.250
<v Speaker 2>they're all sexless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also not true.</v>

10
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.960
<v Speaker 2>They have desire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>capability and satisfaction unless have</v>

11
00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:42.961
<v Speaker 2>a disease of some sort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even those who are now increasingly</v>

12
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.970
<v Speaker 2>treatable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still capable of learning.</v>

13
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.560
<v Speaker 2>And a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

14
00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:49.360
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

15
00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:54.361
<v Speaker 2>right now they're already 74,007 areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means people over 100 years of age</v>

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.890
<v Speaker 2>and they have remained independent and</v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of through their 90 50 year.</v>

17
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.443
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

18
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.230
<v Speaker 2>there was no way to assume that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not able to learn just because</v>

19
00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.120
<v Speaker 2>they're getting older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

20
00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:10.730
<v Speaker 2>it's built into the central nervous</v>
<v Speaker 2>system and it's simply hasn't played out</v>

21
00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:14.140
<v Speaker 2>as yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose he had the 200 year old</v>

22
00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:16.150
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they would have trouble,</v>

23
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.370
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know that yet.</v>

24
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the great ways to do it</v>

25
00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:30.100
<v Speaker 2>is to learn something totally different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a new language,</v>

26
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.370
<v Speaker 2>a musical instrument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because had rarely challenged as the</v>

27
00:01:33.371 --> 00:01:38.371
<v Speaker 2>brain and learning more of the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like continue to do crossword puzzles</v>

28
00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:42.400
<v Speaker 2>might be okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as desirable or as</v>

29
00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:45.070
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A stimulant to the central nervous</v>

30
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 2>system is a brand new challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a new language or a musical</v>

31
00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:50.440
<v Speaker 2>instrument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

32
00:01:50.441 --> 00:01:53.980
<v Speaker 2>the capacity for learning new things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vocabulary,</v>

33
00:01:53.981 --> 00:01:58.981
<v Speaker 2>building a judge Matt actually grows</v>
<v Speaker 2>with age of speed changes.</v>

34
00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:02.890
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not as quick and responding to a</v>

35
00:02:02.891 --> 00:02:03.724
<v Speaker 2>stimulus.</v>

36
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
