00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Intuition pumps are sometimes called</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought experiments more often they're</v>

2
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:13.320
<v Speaker 1>called thought experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not really formal arguments.</v>

3
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Typically their stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their little fables,</v>

4
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.101
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

5
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I think they're similar to aesop's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fables and that they were supposed to</v>

6
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.980
<v Speaker 1>have a moral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to teach us something</v>

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.550
<v Speaker 1>and what they do is they lead the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience to an intuition,</v>

8
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>a conclusion where you sort of pound</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fist on the table and you say,</v>

9
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be that way,</v>

10
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:36.410
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it,</v>

11
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>if it achieves that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's pumped.</v>

12
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>The intuition that was designed to pump</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are persuasion machines,</v>

13
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>a little persuasion machines that</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers have been using for several</v>

14
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that intuition pumps are</v>

15
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>particularly valuable when there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion about what the right questions</v>

16
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>are and what the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what matters,</v>

17
00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Speaker 1>what matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To answer the question,</v>

18
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.520
<v Speaker 1>I think we're all pretty good at using</v>
<v Speaker 1>examples too,</v>

19
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>to think about things.</v>

20
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.740
<v Speaker 1>And intuition pumps are usually rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>vivid examples that are from which</v>

21
00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:15.741
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to draw a very general</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral and they come up in many walks of</v>

22
00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anytime you're a puzzled or confused</v>

23
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 1>about what to do next or whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's true or false,</v>

24
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 1>you might cast about for an intuition</v>
<v Speaker 1>pump that could help you.</v>

25
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>When I first coined determined intuition</v>
<v Speaker 1>pump,</v>

26
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.870
<v Speaker 1>it's when Doug Hofstadter and I were</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on the mind's eye,</v>

27
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>which has lots of intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pumps,</v>

28
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>lots of thought experiments in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Doug came up with a great metaphor.</v>

29
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:42.750
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want to do with any of these</v>

30
00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>intuition pumps is twittle all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>knobs.</v>

31
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Turn the knobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what makes it work.</v>

32
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Now though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is actually something that we're</v>

33
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 1>familiar with from other parts of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

34
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>If there's a gadget and you want to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it does,</v>

35
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>turn the knobs to see what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what,</v>

36
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.930
<v Speaker 1>see what the moving parts.</v>

37
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Do a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I encourage</v>

38
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.800
<v Speaker 1>everybody to not not just to take an</v>
<v Speaker 1>intuition pump as it's handed to them,</v>

39
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>but look at the moving part c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what makes it tick.</v>

40
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Try to figure out what if I adjust this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will it still pumped the same intuition?</v>

41
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still yield the same putative</v>

42
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>conclusion or will the whole thing fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart?</v>

43
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting to see that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of times philosophers will make an</v>

44
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>intuition pump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to do great work until you</v>

45
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>start turning the knobs and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that it actually depends on.</v>

46
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>You're not thinking clearly about some</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of the problem.</v>

47
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Then you've exposed it as as not a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>intuition pump,</v>

48
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.550
<v Speaker 1>but as actually a sort of negative one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call them boom crashes because they</v>

49
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:50.850
<v Speaker 1>explode in your face.</v>
