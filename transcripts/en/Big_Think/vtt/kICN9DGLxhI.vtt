1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.600
<v Speaker 1>We are entering what I call the golden</v>
<v Speaker 1>era of space exploration.</v>

2
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.900
<v Speaker 1>The first golden era was back in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties,</v>

3
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:16.320
<v Speaker 1>but it was unsustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1966,</v>

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.350
<v Speaker 1>the NASA budget consumed five percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire federal budget.</v>

5
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 1>It was impossible to sustain that level</v>
<v Speaker 1>of spending.</v>

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Now it's about point five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

7
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>now with the injunction of new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh enthusiasm from the private</v>

8
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 1>sector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Silicon Valley,</v>

9
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 1>billionaires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a whole new different landscape.</v>

10
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Just recently we had that sensational</v>
<v Speaker 1>launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket</v>

11
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.640
<v Speaker 1>financed by zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero amount of taxpayers dollars,</v>

12
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 1>and it shows you that the economics have</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed and now with the introduction of</v>

13
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:57.210
<v Speaker 1>reusable rockets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about opening up the</v>

14
00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:02.211
<v Speaker 1>heavens to perhaps a whole new economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape that is 10 percent.</v>

15
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>The cost of the past to put me in orbit</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the earth,</v>

16
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>cost about $10,000 a pound.</v>

17
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>That's my weight in gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of my body made out of solid gold.</v>

18
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.870
<v Speaker 1>That's where it takes me to put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to go around the earth in near</v>

19
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 1>orbit to go to the moon would cost about</v>
<v Speaker 1>$100,000 a pound to put me on a Mars</v>

20
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.840
<v Speaker 1>because at least a million dollars a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pound that is unsustainable and that's</v>

21
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:33.720
<v Speaker 1>where the reusable rockets come in</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're not talking about dropping</v>

22
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 1>the cost by a factor of 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of $10,000 a pound spacex,</v>

23
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 1>wants to bring it down to a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars a pound.</v>

24
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 1>December of 2019.</v>
<v Speaker 1>NASA will send the sls booster rocket</v>

25
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:52.761
<v Speaker 1>and the Orion module around the moon on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a robotic unmanned mission.</v>

26
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Just a few years after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first astronauts will go back to the</v>

27
00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:02.871
<v Speaker 1>moon after a 50 year gap and buy later</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next decade.</v>

28
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 1>We hope to have a lunar orbiter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lunar orbiter that gives us a permanent</v>

29
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>presence in outer space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just the space station,</v>

30
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:12.840
<v Speaker 1>but a lunar orbiter.</v>

31
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.140
<v Speaker 1>And from that we want to go all the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Mars.</v>

32
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>And so NASA has already now look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>blueprints made by Boeing aircraft</v>

33
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>concerning what it would take to send</v>
<v Speaker 1>probes to Mars.</v>

34
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may even have a traffic accident</v>

35
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 1>around Mars because of the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>space x not to be done,</v>

36
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.090
<v Speaker 1>they're proposing their big rocket to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take us,</v>

37
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>not just to the moon with the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 1>space capsule and the and the Falcon</v>

38
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>heavy rocket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a new rocket,</v>

39
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>the bfr rocket to take us all the way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mars,</v>

40
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.620
<v Speaker 1>even bypassing the lunar orbiter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also have a new vision emerging for</v>

41
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Elon musk of space x is to create a</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplanetary species.</v>

42
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.280
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Jeff Bezos of Amazon,</v>

43
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.740
<v Speaker 1>he wants to make earth into a park so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all the heavy industries,</v>

44
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:10.171
<v Speaker 1>all the pollution goes into outer space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jeff Bezos wants to set an Amazon</v>

45
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 1>type delivery system connecting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth to the moon.</v>

46
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.620
<v Speaker 1>I was talked to Carl Sagan and he said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because the earth is in the middle</v>

47
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>of a shooting gallery of asteroids and</v>
<v Speaker 1>comets and meteors,</v>

48
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>it's inevitable that we will be hit with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a planet buster.</v>

49
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

50
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:34.291
<v Speaker 1>Hit the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need an insurance policy now.</v>

51
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>He was clear to say that we're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about moving the population of</v>

52
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>the earth into outer space that costs</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much money and we have problems of</v>

53
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>our own on the earth by global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to deal with those problems on</v>

54
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not fleeing in outer space,</v>

55
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Speaker 1>but as an insurance policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to make sure that that humans</v>

56
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>become a two planet species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the words of Carl Sagan,</v>

57
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.140
<v Speaker 1>and now of course Elon Musk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants to put it up to a million a</v>

58
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>million colonists on the planet Mars</v>
<v Speaker 1>send to Mars by his rockets,</v>

59
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 1>financed by a combination of public and</v>
<v Speaker 1>private funding.</v>

60
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>And remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has the vision,</v>

61
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 1>the energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the checkbook to make many of these</v>

62
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 1>ideas into a reality.</v>
