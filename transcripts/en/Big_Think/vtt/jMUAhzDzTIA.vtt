1
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>the great driver of all of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>participatory changes is the choice by</v>

3
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>individuals to be active instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>passive.</v>

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fed ourselves on a notion that humans</v>

5
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>were office drones at work and couch</v>
<v Speaker 1>potatoes at home and it was just kind of</v>

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>shuttling back and forth from one to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other and then when the opportunity to</v>

7
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>participate came about even in know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in relatively small ways,</v>

8
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

9
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be sharing photos of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing or I'm,</v>

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a poem and I'm going to put it</v>

11
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>up on my blog and maybe only three</v>
<v Speaker 1>people read it,</v>

12
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:44.541
<v Speaker 1>but that's more than none a that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that almost all of that is personal</v>

13
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:45.331
<v Speaker 1>drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

14
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 1>That's the big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the big producer of the change.</v>

15
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>And the individual participants are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficiaries,</v>

16
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.271
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

17
00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

18
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 1>the choice to be active benefits.</v>

19
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.870
<v Speaker 1>The person who makes that choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beneficiaries dance stream of that</v>

21
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

22
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

23
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.420
<v Speaker 1>as we talked about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really depends on what kind of sharing</v>

24
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:09.030
<v Speaker 1>is being done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I make a new law cat run,</v>

25
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I find the cutest picture ever and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it the funniest caption ever.</v>

26
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>It makes some people laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

27
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>You can't claim a big social benefit</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

28
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if at the other extreme I'm at patients</v>

29
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:25.161
<v Speaker 1>like me and I'm trying to change a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to change medical research</v>

30
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might get a disease,</v>

31
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understood and a cure developed faster</v>

32
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.240
<v Speaker 1>and that benefits not only everyone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>has the disease at benefit society as a</v>

33
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:39.150
<v Speaker 1>whole for having fewer resources go</v>
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

34
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.940
<v Speaker 1>go into treatment of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

35
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 1>of whatever disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a,</v>

36
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of work recently on als.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so once you get past an individual</v>

37
00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 1>who chooses to be active getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits for themselves,</v>

38
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>you really have to look at what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>participation is doing to see who</v>

39
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:59.820
<v Speaker 1>benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the range of benefits that are</v>

40
00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>possible from harnessing this cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>surplus is quite extraordinary.</v>

41
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I say it's bad when it becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>addictive,</v>

42
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a big,</v>

43
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.710
<v Speaker 1>there's a big discussion about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>whether or not the word addiction is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate inappropriate words,</v>

45
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>large.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A large clinical conversation about</v>

46
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Internet addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Al,</v>

47
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>but I will tell you that in the early</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties I felt it.</v>

48
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I used the word addict to describe</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself in a completely,</v>

49
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>in a completely unironically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was addicted to something called</v>

50
00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Usenet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the global set of both boards.</v>

51
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>And I had to addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>classic pathology,</v>

52
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:46.101
<v Speaker 1>which is that I needed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be on using it every day.</v>

53
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Not because it made me happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after a while because if I didn't do</v>

54
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it made me feel bad.</v>

55
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is the,</v>

56
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our,</v>

57
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.700
<v Speaker 1>I remember literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the morning where I woke up</v>

58
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.530
<v Speaker 1>and I did not need to check my email and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

59
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was as if a fever had broke.</v>

60
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

61
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>the deeply wired pleasures of social</v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction coupled with the kind of</v>

62
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:16.861
<v Speaker 1>mediated space we live in a can create a</v>
<v Speaker 1>can create these kinds of addictions and</v>

63
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:21.680
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's updating their,</v>

64
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 1>updating their profile page on a social</v>
<v Speaker 1>network or it's playing a game or what</v>

65
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 1>have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can lead people to do many of the</v>

66
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 1>things that the pathology of addiction</v>
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>

67
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>which is to cut themselves off from</v>
<v Speaker 1>their friends,</v>

68
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 1>to neglect their social life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neglect their schoolwork,</v>

69
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>neglect their work and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are the kinds of things that</v>

70
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 1>society has always grappled with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:44.300
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 1>it's the problem around a gambler's</v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymous,</v>

73
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>right where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that you're injecting a</v>

74
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:52.550
<v Speaker 1>chemical into your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like alcoholism or,</v>

75
00:03:52.551 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or cocaine or what have you,</v>

76
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is an activity that's changing the,</v>

77
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's giving you the endorphin rush</v>

78
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>or giving you the chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chemical consistency like in your</v>

79
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:05.434
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

80
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>And as with gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are kinds of activities that can</v>

81
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:10.470
<v Speaker 1>become addicting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

82
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my personal guess,</v>

83
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 1>although I am not a clinician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my personal guess is that Internet</v>

84
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 1>addiction and even more than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet addiction,</v>

85
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>particular classes of addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social gaming addiction,</v>

86
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 1>social network addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so forth are going to be understood</v>

87
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.420
<v Speaker 1>better in the next five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll turn out to be much rarer than</v>

88
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:30.400
<v Speaker 1>the hand wringing in the press would</v>
<v Speaker 1>currently.</v>

89
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.220
<v Speaker 1>We currently have you believe where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone who uses facebook is a,</v>

90
00:04:34.221 --> 00:04:39.221
<v Speaker 1>is an addict or a punitive addict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they will be a nontrivial number of</v>

91
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:41.330
<v Speaker 1>cases where people are genuinely</v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted.</v>

92
00:04:41.331 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>And I think as a society will then have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find ways,</v>

93
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to convince those people to help them</v>

94
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 1>out of that addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the same way we have done with</v>

95
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:55.420
<v Speaker 1>gambling is gambling and spread outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Vegas to include most of the country.</v>
