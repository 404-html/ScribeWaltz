1
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a very important question because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to learn to love whatever you</v>

2
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:11.850
<v Speaker 1>do like in the failures as much as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>successes because they'll probably be a</v>

3
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:14.970
<v Speaker 1>lot more failures than successes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a very important lesson to</v>

4
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>learn early on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I learned it early in my career</v>

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>because my phd really got off to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty poor star and so there's a long</v>

6
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>period of time where I had to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this worth it?</v>

7
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of my friends were just sort of</v>

8
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>you're already accepted into medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

10
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 1>why do you even need this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think I was just really like the,</v>

11
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>the puzzle that I was sort of trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what is a compelling enough</v>

12
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>to me that I kept going with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think in science you have to be</v>

13
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 1>very patient and you have to enjoy like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process and it's nice to think about</v>

14
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>where the process will take you.</v>

15
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>But it's important to enjoy like each</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of the process itself.</v>

16
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I think that we're lucky because</v>

17
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 1>we're in a time right now that there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many tools available that there are</v>

18
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:57.640
<v Speaker 1>many discoveries being made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so um,</v>

19
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just many opportunities to</v>

20
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>advance the field and it's coming from</v>
<v Speaker 1>all directions,</v>

21
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.800
<v Speaker 1>so that's a lucky time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously there will be droughts</v>

22
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:08.570
<v Speaker 1>where we figured we've kind of tapped</v>
<v Speaker 1>the genome to its full potential and</v>

23
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>looking for the next thing and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulties with each aspect of</v>

24
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>changing paradigms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'll,</v>

25
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 1>there will be periods have already</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced some,</v>

26
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe not like the biggest I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

27
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 1>but it definitely experienced long</v>
<v Speaker 1>periods of failed work.</v>

28
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just,</v>

29
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>I still enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just enjoy the day to day and that's</v>

30
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>important to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like teaching.</v>

31
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I love teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

32
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why I didn't</v>

33
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked at being in an undergraduate</v>

34
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 1>campus because I really enjoy teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

35
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>I think it's wonderful and you're very</v>
<v Speaker 1>lucky to be with such.</v>

36
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean all students are really exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really lucky to be with such</v>

37
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>motivated students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

38
00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:45.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an easy job,</v>

39
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:47.850
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really up to you.</v>

40
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 1>if the students are engaged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something you have to think about.</v>

42
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>How do you engage them.</v>
