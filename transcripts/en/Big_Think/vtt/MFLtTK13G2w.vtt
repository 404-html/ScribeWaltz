00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.820
<v Speaker 1>From Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my question is,</v>

2
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.910
<v Speaker 1>how do you reach someone who was maybe a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theorist or someone who is a</v>

3
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.230
<v Speaker 1>anti vaccines?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm someone who is staunchly,</v>

4
00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:25.280
<v Speaker 1>scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically illiterate and agree with</v>

5
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.340
<v Speaker 1>them on what a good source of facts is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

6
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.460
<v Speaker 2>So Daniel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I.</v>

7
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.640
<v Speaker 2>How do I recommend reasoning with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theorist?</v>

8
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last couple months I've been messing</v>

9
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:44.900
<v Speaker 2>around with this idea of cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>dissonance.</v>

10
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.130
<v Speaker 2>This is to say you have a worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're presented with evidence that</v>

11
00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:52.310
<v Speaker 2>conflicts with the worldview so you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You either have to change your</v>

12
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:54.590
<v Speaker 2>worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is hard because you've lived your</v>

13
00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:58.250
<v Speaker 2>whole life with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you just dismiss the evidence and</v>

14
00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:01.610
<v Speaker 2>dismissed the authorities that may have</v>
<v Speaker 2>provided the evidence.</v>

15
00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 2>The authority can be a person or it</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be a book or shoot me an article</v>

16
00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:10.550
<v Speaker 2>in the new electric Internet computer</v>
<v Speaker 2>machine to so you dismiss the evidence</v>

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.630
<v Speaker 2>so that you don't have this discomfort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this conflict in your mind,</v>

18
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.510
<v Speaker 2>this dissonance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I'm working with right</v>

19
00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:20.360
<v Speaker 2>now and apparently the way to overcome</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is to say,</v>

20
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:22.940
<v Speaker 2>we're all in this together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's learn about this together,</v>

21
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 2>present the conspiracy theorists with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that he or she may be rejecting</v>

22
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:32.660
<v Speaker 2>evidence because it's just so</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable that you're in it</v>

23
00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:33.140
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

24
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.060
<v Speaker 2>We're in it together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm uncomfortable too,</v>

25
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.270
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to moon landings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just ask the person and how you would</v>

26
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.780
<v Speaker 2>generate all that paperwork,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the warehouses full of documentation,</v>

27
00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:49.781
<v Speaker 2>but national NASA created a to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>landings on the moon would overwhelm any</v>

28
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.930
<v Speaker 2>anybody trying to do it on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>

29
00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:57.800
<v Speaker 2>it just be very difficult to print all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and just understand it's a process.</v>

30
00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Somebody who has a worldview that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>inconsistent with evidence and I may</v>

31
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:03.520
<v Speaker 2>have some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

32
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.110
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes a while for you to turn around,</v>

33
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.320
<v Speaker 2>like the example of palm reading or</v>
<v Speaker 2>astrology.</v>

34
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:13.160
<v Speaker 2>It's not something people reverse their</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas about immediately.</v>

35
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.830
<v Speaker 2>It takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my experience,</v>

36
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.980
<v Speaker 2>takes about two years for somebody to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of look at palm reading,</v>

37
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.940
<v Speaker 2>look at cold reading or a Tarot card</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading for a while,</v>

38
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:26.000
<v Speaker 2>and then realized that these Tarot card</v>
<v Speaker 2>readers,</v>

39
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:28.790
<v Speaker 2>palm readers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are just taking information that you've</v>

40
00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:30.950
<v Speaker 2>given them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the clients given them and feeding back</v>

41
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:31.430
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>

42
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 2>It takes a long time in the same way</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who,</v>

43
00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:37.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are anti-vaccine,</v>

44
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.790
<v Speaker 2>I think I've just lost sight of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

45
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Vaccines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

46
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.580
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason I'm able to be here</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking with you is my grandparents did</v>

47
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:51.581
<v Speaker 2>not die in 1918 during the Spanish flu</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it has estimated 50 million people</v>

48
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:56.540
<v Speaker 2>died twice as many peoples were killed</v>
<v Speaker 2>in combat,</v>

49
00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:59.870
<v Speaker 2>in World War One died of this disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to old cemeteries,</v>

50
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 2>you can see these tombstones of very</v>
<v Speaker 2>young people died of the flu.</v>

51
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 2>So people just lost sight of history and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

52
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 2>we all tend to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

53
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 2>look at the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change your mind,</v>

54
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 2>but it takes people a couple of years to</v>
<v Speaker 2>change their minds.</v>

55
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 2>So my recommendation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daniel,</v>

56
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:18.920
<v Speaker 2>is stick with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll get frustrated.</v>

57
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 2>The person will get but present the idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>of cognitive dissonance.</v>

58
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:28.621
<v Speaker 2>This is my latest idea about a way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>work together to a scientific</v>

59
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 2>understanding.</v>
