3
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 2>that they've got the Nobel prize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was here talking to the students</v>

4
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.950
<v Speaker 2>just a couple of years ago because she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>now a very distinguished scientist.</v>

5
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.190
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she discovered pass,</v>

6
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.090
<v Speaker 2>but 40 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

7
00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:34.210
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

8
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>students for asking,</v>

9
00:00:36.221 --> 00:00:38.260
<v Speaker 2>how are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry you didn't get the Nobel prize.</v>

10
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.371
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

11
00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:41.020
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been all my life.</v>

12
00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:44.320
<v Speaker 2>I've just been famous for not having no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Nobel prize,</v>

13
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.740
<v Speaker 2>that was actually much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's right.</v>

14
00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:51.574
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

15
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.340
<v Speaker 2>it's much better if people ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why didn't you get the prize?</v>

16
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.490
<v Speaker 2>It's much better than if they're asking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did you get it?</v>

17
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say bringing up six kids and who</v>

18
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:07.360
<v Speaker 2>are all productive citizens and.</v>
