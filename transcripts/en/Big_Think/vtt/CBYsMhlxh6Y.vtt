00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.003
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.040
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 2>I think that all of us who in some way</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Anglo Saxon a half to realize that</v>

4
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 2>there are other ideas around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.140
<v Speaker 2>and that they can be added to our own</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking and vocabulary and that we have</v>

6
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 2>to be open minded towards others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

7
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:35.541
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean that we give up</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural basic assumptions such as human</v>

8
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such as the rights of women and children</v>

9
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.980
<v Speaker 2>because some of these basic assumptions</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our societies we must not give up and</v>

10
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.830
<v Speaker 2>we have to continue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think arguing and,</v>

11
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:59.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>illustrating how they benefit society</v>

12
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 2>when you pursue them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean that you cannot</v>

13
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:07.400
<v Speaker 2>collaborate with countries far away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

14
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.440
<v Speaker 2>which are inspired by a global community</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is all the time learning from each</v>

15
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:16.320
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from different corners of the world.</v>

16
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.950
<v Speaker 2>And we don't have to give up our</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity even if we open up to other</v>

17
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 2>cultures and other assumptions.</v>

18
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the basic thing we identified</v>

19
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 2>was that in the 19 eighties we had come</v>
<v Speaker 2>so far in seeing the dramatic and</v>

20
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.380
<v Speaker 2>emerging trends of the planet being</v>
<v Speaker 2>affected by our human activities that</v>

21
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:49.690
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first time in human history,</v>

22
00:01:49.691 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 2>we realized that we are not only</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for each other,</v>

23
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 2>those who are living today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that we are responsible to take care</v>

24
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 2>of the opportunities for future</v>
<v Speaker 2>generations.</v>

25
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.060
<v Speaker 2>That was the basic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

26
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.080
<v Speaker 2>content of that observation and about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the concept of sustainable development</v>

27
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.810
<v Speaker 2>that we need to also considered the</v>
<v Speaker 2>future of coming generations,</v>

28
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 5,100 years ago,</v>

29
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 2>people south about future generations</v>
<v Speaker 2>with regard to their own son or daughter</v>

30
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:30.561
<v Speaker 2>taking over the farm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't have to sync a in terms</v>

31
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.360
<v Speaker 2>of the global,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

32
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.590
<v Speaker 2>aspects of our footprints with undermine</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future choices of generations.</v>

33
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 2>Unborn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

34
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:45.930
<v Speaker 2>I think is the basic part of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>concept.</v>
