00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Barry's a country was opened in 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>million population in a country with a</v>

2
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 1>long history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rich culture,</v>

3
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.070
<v Speaker 1>and unfortunately some of the production</v>
<v Speaker 1>practices and enormous affect women and</v>

4
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:29.781
<v Speaker 1>negatively in the practice of Lfr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a abducting girls for marriage,</v>

5
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.250
<v Speaker 1>is one of the harmful practices that</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect other physical and mental,</v>

6
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as with less social economic lives of</v>

7
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>women in Ethiopia.</v>

8
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Mm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

9
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>I heard about the story on the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

10
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.921
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

11
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>I was in a car with a driver and we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to radio and,</v>

12
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:51.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

13
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a media coverage about 14</v>

14
00:01:56.221 --> 00:02:01.221
<v Speaker 1>years old girls being abducted and raped</v>
<v Speaker 1>and killing her would be husband.</v>

15
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.250
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>learned about story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I immediately thought that we should be</v>

17
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.790
<v Speaker 1>going to this place which is 300</v>
<v Speaker 1>kilometers outside our discipline,</v>

18
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.600
<v Speaker 1>our where we work and we should be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to defend the code.</v>

19
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.070
<v Speaker 1>I thought about this because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.420
<v Speaker 1>I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>we should save her life because she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a facing like a life sentence.</v>

22
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>And secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

23
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:39.561
<v Speaker 1>I knew that this is going to be a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>case precedent setting case,</v>

24
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>which we'll see we could use for public</v>
<v Speaker 1>education to,</v>

25
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.980
<v Speaker 1>it has the dialogue and the conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

27
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abduction around that</v>

28
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 2>onto and asked you kind of got him</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncle.</v>

29
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>For some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially people living in the West is</v>

30
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 1>completely outside their experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

31
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really educate,</v>

32
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 1>educate people or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how women live in the other part of the</v>

34
00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:12.750
<v Speaker 1>world lit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>

35
00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:15.270
<v Speaker 1>it's also a call to action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

36
00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:16.910
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

37
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 1>education been a women's rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations and,</v>

38
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:23.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.420
<v Speaker 1>government and then government and</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions whose mandate focus on</v>

40
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 1>gender equality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:35.761
<v Speaker 1>would like to use this field to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for advocacy for a ligand reform and to</v>

42
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 1>sort of enhance and accelerate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

43
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>programs,</v>

44
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.811
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards,</v>

45
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:47.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>

46
00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:48.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.640
<v Speaker 1>fighting child marriage around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

48
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Like that's my hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting Angelina Jolie was quite</v>

49
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 1>helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie,</v>

50
00:04:57.281 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 1>the content history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:04.711
<v Speaker 1>the presentation is fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but her are going to be the executive</v>

52
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 1>producer of really give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took it to another label,</v>

53
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.040
<v Speaker 1>to another height.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

54
00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:13.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what was kind of</v>

55
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.040
<v Speaker 1>a highlight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will</v>

56
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.200
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>

57
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

58
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm on Jay and Martha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this film is quite educational</v>

59
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>because it does not necessarily judge</v>
<v Speaker 1>the community.</v>

60
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.040
<v Speaker 1>It does not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of point the finger desert</v>

62
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.190
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of</v>

63
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.400
<v Speaker 1>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.550
<v Speaker 1>where the thinking comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a mixture you to have a</v>

65
00:05:54.431 --> 00:05:59.270
<v Speaker 1>conversation with yourself because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes,</v>

66
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you,</v>

67
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.530
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy a sort of a sin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.420
<v Speaker 1>because this people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have lived half lived was a</v>

69
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 1>practitioner for a number of years and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they know.</v>

70
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 1>That's what they believe from time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

71
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:21.641
<v Speaker 1>we need to go back to the drawing board</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we need to have a real conversation</v>

72
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.620
<v Speaker 1>on why these things are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not enough to say,</v>

73
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a culture where it's a tradition we</v>

74
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.490
<v Speaker 1>need to discuss about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unpack and to discuss about why this is</v>

75
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
