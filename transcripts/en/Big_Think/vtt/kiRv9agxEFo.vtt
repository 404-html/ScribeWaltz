1
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm the Felix Frankfurter professor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>law at Harvard Law School where I've</v>

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.310
<v Speaker 1>been teaching for</v>

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.860
<v Speaker 2>43 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.130
<v Speaker 2>Larry Summers and I had a contest for</v>
<v Speaker 2>who got tenure,</v>

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 2>youngest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had been the youngest professor to get</v>

6
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 2>tenure at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he beat me by three right</v>

7
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.570
<v Speaker 1>maths when he got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a frightened,</v>

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I was born</v>

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 2>on the eve of the Holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1938.</v>

10
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother,</v>

11
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.550
<v Speaker 2>when my brother was born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother kept saying she didn't know</v>

12
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:39.480
<v Speaker 2>whether she would have him in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunker in the basement somewhere.</v>

13
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.490
<v Speaker 2>We were all terrified of war and we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>all terrified of what was happening to</v>

14
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 2>the Jewish community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a powerless community at the</v>

15
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hard to imagine today,</v>

16
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 2>but no influence in Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no influence,</v>

17
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really in any aspect of politics.</v>

18
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a community that really felt that</v>

19
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:02.100
<v Speaker 2>they were the guests in somebody else's</v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

20
00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 2>They were second class citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were tolerated at best and they had</v>

21
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 2>better behave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

22
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 2>and it was a community of people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>very patriotic,</v>

23
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 2>quite conservative in their outlook</v>
<v Speaker 2>toward,</v>

24
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many things.</v>

25
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people sometimes stereotype the Jewish</v>

26
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 2>communities being very radical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a community.</v>

27
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 2>And there are many secular Jews who were</v>
<v Speaker 2>radical during that period of time.</v>

28
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Some communists and socialists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the Orthodox community,</v>

29
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in quite conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite patriotic.</v>

30
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

31
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frightened is the word I think I would</v>

32
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 2>use more than any other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

33
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 2>the message I constantly got from my</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents and grandparents was shushed.</v>

34
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 2>Still be quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be quiet,</v>

35
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 2>don't rock the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do anything.</v>

36
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.690
<v Speaker 2>Don't make your hosts the real Americans</v>
<v Speaker 2>mad at you.</v>

37
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you do do quietly.</v>

38
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it didn't take with me and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I reacted.</v>

39
00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think too that</v>

40
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.360
<v Speaker 1>it's always nice to say your parents had</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest influence.</v>

41
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.310
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In my case,</v>

42
00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:09.100
<v Speaker 2>my father had very little influence on</v>
<v Speaker 2>my growing up.</v>

43
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:12.340
<v Speaker 2>He was very busy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a small store which was not</v>

44
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:14.710
<v Speaker 2>particularly successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was away all the time,</v>

45
00:02:14.711 --> 00:02:18.340
<v Speaker 2>six days a week at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the seventh day was the sabbath,</v>

46
00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:22.930
<v Speaker 2>a day of rest where his job was to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>me up and drag me to the synagogue and</v>

47
00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:25.840
<v Speaker 2>sit next to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While he went pray,</v>

48
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.200
<v Speaker 2>pray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the interaction wasn't particularly,</v>

49
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intimate or close.</v>

50
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.920
<v Speaker 2>My mother was somewhat ambitious for me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she did defend me when I got into</v>

51
00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:40.921
<v Speaker 2>trouble and kind of showed me a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit how you can stand up for rights.</v>

52
00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:45.400
<v Speaker 2>But I think my greatest impact came from</v>
<v Speaker 2>teachers and peers.</v>

53
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly after I got out of the</v>

54
00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:50.830
<v Speaker 2>yeshiva system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the Jewish parochial</v>

55
00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:52.780
<v Speaker 2>school system had much of an impact on</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

56
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.840
<v Speaker 2>I rebelled against it in that respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It did have an impact.</v>

57
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.300
<v Speaker 2>But when I got to Brooklyn College and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yale Law School,</v>

58
00:02:58.301 --> 00:03:00.780
<v Speaker 2>I was looking role models.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

59
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 2>I quickly learned there are no such</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and that every hero has clay feet</v>

60
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 2>and that everybody I respected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

61
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:12.181
<v Speaker 2>it was a flawed human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was able to learn quite a bit,</v>

62
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 2>both intellectually and morally from</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of my mentors,</v>

63
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 2>particularly the two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

64
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.780
<v Speaker 2>judges I clerked for after I finished</v>
<v Speaker 2>law school or Justice Arthur Goldberg of</v>

65
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 2>the United States Supreme Court and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Judge David Basil on,</v>

66
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 2>they were both activists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>left liberal,</v>

67
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 2>moderate left wing Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>labor union activists,</v>

68
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 2>progressive's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they showed me how I could live a</v>

69
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Jewish life life in which I was not</v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrassed about my heritage,</v>

70
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 2>where I could make the best of it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>use the best from it and still</v>

71
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:47.270
<v Speaker 2>contribute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

72
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.320
<v Speaker 2>to America the world and not live in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shtetl in the ghetto from which,</v>

73
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up</v>

74
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.040
<v Speaker 1>and grew out</v>
<v Speaker 1>would</v>

75
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.513
<v Speaker 1>probably be</v>

76
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.100
<v Speaker 2>one summer in camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

77
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between my junior and senior year in</v>

78
00:04:06.741 --> 00:04:08.570
<v Speaker 2>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a terrible high school student.</v>

79
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got cs and b minuses.</v>

80
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.960
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my yearbook originally said I was a good</v>

81
00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:16.700
<v Speaker 2>speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of your books had Dershowitz,</v>

82
00:04:16.701 --> 00:04:18.860
<v Speaker 2>he has a mouth of webster and ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>clay.</v>

83
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.320
<v Speaker 2>It was cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

84
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.000
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my rabbi said to me,</v>

85
00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:23.840
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dershowitz,</v>

86
00:04:23.841 --> 00:04:24.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a good mouth on.</v>

87
00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:27.530
<v Speaker 2>You're not a very good brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to figure out a profession</v>

88
00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:29.510
<v Speaker 2>that you can use your mouth a lot and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not your head.</v>

89
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should either be a lawyer or he said</v>

90
00:04:31.821 --> 00:04:33.380
<v Speaker 2>a conservative rabbi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

91
00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:36.260
<v Speaker 2>of course an Orthodox rabbi and that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest put down you could,</v>

92
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.140
<v Speaker 2>you could have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was put down a lot in high school</v>

93
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.130
<v Speaker 2>and there was this one guy in camp who</v>
<v Speaker 2>was four or five years older than me who</v>

94
00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:43.964
<v Speaker 2>was a counselor.</v>

95
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.650
<v Speaker 2>And he picked me to play the leading</v>
<v Speaker 2>role in a play Cyrano de Bergerac by</v>

96
00:04:48.651 --> 00:04:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Edmund Rustin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember it as if it was today.</v>

97
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.140
<v Speaker 2>It was not only my long knows that</v>
<v Speaker 2>qualified me for the job,</v>

98
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.210
<v Speaker 2>but I was not a bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad actor.</v>

99
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.400
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was the first person,</v>

100
00:04:58.401 --> 00:05:00.050
<v Speaker 2>he sat me down one day and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

101
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.650
<v Speaker 2>you're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a very interesting mind,</v>

102
00:05:03.651 --> 00:05:07.730
<v Speaker 2>you see things differently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be a great student in</v>

103
00:05:07.731 --> 00:05:08.720
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

104
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.510
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even get decent grades in a</v>

105
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.090
<v Speaker 2>third rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crummy high school.</v>

106
00:05:14.091 --> 00:05:16.760
<v Speaker 2>How am I going to do well in college?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

107
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.510
<v Speaker 2>the better the school you go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better you'll do.</v>

108
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.430
<v Speaker 2>And he was absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Brooklyn College,</v>

109
00:05:22.431 --> 00:05:23.480
<v Speaker 2>I did very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>

110
00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:25.760
<v Speaker 2>And then I went to Yale law school and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was first in my class.</v>

111
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.670
<v Speaker 2>Yale law school was one of the elite</v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions.</v>

112
00:05:28.671 --> 00:05:32.510
<v Speaker 2>He was so right that the more</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging the institution,</v>

113
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 2>the better I was going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was an insight that I just</v>

114
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.310
<v Speaker 1>didn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Day.</v>

115
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I started this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was never any other path.</v>

116
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always a lawyer from the time I</v>

117
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 2>was five or six years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My father,</v>

118
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 2>although an uneducated didn't finish</v>
<v Speaker 2>high school,</v>

119
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it didn't read very much.</v>

120
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

121
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 2>worker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

122
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 2>he liked to stand up for the underdog</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he did convey that to me.</v>

123
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 2>And my family had a tradition of</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing up for the underdog.</v>

124
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:10.241
<v Speaker 2>My father's family helped rescue people</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the Holocaust and social action and</v>

125
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:15.560
<v Speaker 2>social commitment was part of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>heritage in some respects.</v>

126
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.880
<v Speaker 2>But I always thought I was going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lawyer and the only kind of a lawyer I</v>

127
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 2>ever thought of was a criminal or who.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else is there?</v>

128
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not working for the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't work for big government or</v>

129
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 2>big corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to be the lawyer for the underdog.</v>

130
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:33.620
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think I ever made a decision</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a lawyer or a criminal lawyer.</v>

131
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 2>It was just something that I always</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought I would do.</v>

132
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.290
<v Speaker 2>Others thought I would do what was</v>
<v Speaker 2>expected of me.</v>

133
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.230
<v Speaker 2>It was a role I played since the time I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a child.</v>
