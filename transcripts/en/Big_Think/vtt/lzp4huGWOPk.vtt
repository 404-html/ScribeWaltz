1
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I must have talked about that before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's definitely an in Max Tivoli.</v>

2
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.820
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of passing.</v>

3
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.070
<v Speaker 2>He is a different age than he appears to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be cause he's aging backwards.</v>

4
00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:20.440
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's always pretending to be something</v>

5
00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:24.250
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his friend Huey is passing and</v>

6
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.160
<v Speaker 2>there's the mme who's trying to change</v>
<v Speaker 2>herself.</v>

7
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the story of a marriage,</v>

8
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.330
<v Speaker 2>there's a way in which the book is</v>
<v Speaker 2>passing for a while.</v>

9
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.270
<v Speaker 2>The main character doesn't reveal things</v>
<v Speaker 2>about herself and a lot of the</v>

10
00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:38.470
<v Speaker 2>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

11
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.360
<v Speaker 2>I think certainly for Max Tivoli,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very much on my mind for that</v>

12
00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:45.040
<v Speaker 2>time period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that turn of the century,</v>

13
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.580
<v Speaker 2>19th to 20th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like the moment when emigrants</v>

14
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 2>could transform out of their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>stereotype into an Americanness and then</v>

15
00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:58.690
<v Speaker 2>America was ready to</v>
<v Speaker 2>ready to believe them.</v>

16
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a lot of groups we're able to do</v>

17
00:01:02.951 --> 00:01:04.120
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think there's something kind of</v>

18
00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:06.730
<v Speaker 2>sad about it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to leave all that behind.</v>

19
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 2>So I was really experimenting with what</v>
<v Speaker 2>was complicated about it because Max</v>

20
00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:15.540
<v Speaker 2>gets to do a lot of things and have his</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart's desire,</v>

21
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 1>but he pays a great prices so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone around</v>

22
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to know.</v>

23
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.950
<v Speaker 1>It's very good.</v>

24
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.870
<v Speaker 2>Curious thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think any of us ever thought</v>

25
00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:33.620
<v Speaker 2>there would be a black president phil</v>
<v Speaker 2>nominee as of yesterday when we're</v>

26
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:35.150
<v Speaker 2>taping this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

27
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.890
<v Speaker 2>Aye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

28
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.290
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>

29
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.250
<v Speaker 2>he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is not hiding his race in any way.</v>

30
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 2>I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something's happening where a lot of</v>

31
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:53.420
<v Speaker 2>people are accepting him</v>

32
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:55.783
<v Speaker 3>mmm.</v>

33
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.400
<v Speaker 2>On the terms he's talking about and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not pretending anything as far as I can</v>

34
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:02.791
<v Speaker 2>tell him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

35
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 2>he's a politician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's pretending everything in a way.</v>

36
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the line he's drawing is one,</v>

37
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm prepared to stand behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

38
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like none of it's real.</v>

39
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it'll work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

40
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people would buy it if he</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to pretend that race didn't matter</v>

41
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 2>because that's what he was faced with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had to give that speech.</v>

42
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he could've said,</v>

43
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 2>why are we talking about race?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the steady said,</v>

44
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.910
<v Speaker 1>we need to talk about race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what shocked me really got me.</v>

45
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.870
<v Speaker 1>There was a story that</v>

46
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.420
<v Speaker 2>my grandmother told me about 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago about herself in which she,</v>

47
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 2>a friend of her husbands of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandfather's,</v>

48
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 2>took her for a drive around Rural</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kentucky.</v>

49
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>must've been the early fifties.</v>

50
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.650
<v Speaker 2>And he turned to her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he stopped the car and he turned to her</v>

51
00:03:06.651 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leona,</v>

52
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was your husband's lover in the war</v>

53
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 2>and I'm as lover now and I want to leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>with him and I want you to help me.</v>

54
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.793
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

55
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.470
<v Speaker 2>she could not tell me the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>story because I think the idea was so</v>

56
00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 2>crazy and absurd that you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me out of this car.</v>

57
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:27.300
<v Speaker 2>I never want to see you again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was all over.</v>

58
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.100
<v Speaker 2>She never talked to my grandfather about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

59
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.800
<v Speaker 2>And she regretted all her life that she</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't have left.</v>

60
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.930
<v Speaker 2>But she always told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

61
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.850
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had two sons.</v>

62
00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.710
<v Speaker 2>I'd never had a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a poor woman.</v>

63
00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:42.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand what I was supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

64
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.630
<v Speaker 2>She all the restrictions were honor and</v>
<v Speaker 2>oddly,</v>

65
00:03:45.631 --> 00:03:50.631
<v Speaker 2>that's a part of the story I really</v>
<v Speaker 2>liked was to identify with the woman and</v>

66
00:03:50.821 --> 00:03:53.970
<v Speaker 2>see how trapped she was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously her husband,</v>

67
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.980
<v Speaker 2>my grandfather was trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's a true story,</v>

68
00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:58.410
<v Speaker 2>which I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm grandmother told a lot of crazy</v>

69
00:03:58.411 --> 00:04:00.660
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter to me as a</v>

70
00:04:00.661 --> 00:04:01.710
<v Speaker 2>novelist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

71
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.710
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's trapped for sure.</v>

72
00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:06.570
<v Speaker 2>We know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what was,</v>

73
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.330
<v Speaker 2>what made her so trapped and what made</v>
<v Speaker 2>her life harder than his and a lot of</v>

74
00:04:11.331 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 2>ways and that that was the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wondered what's out.</v>
