1
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And spas is a desperate desire to</v>

2
00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:18.010
<v Speaker 1>understand the world better so that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't blow it up.</v>

3
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds rather simplistic,</v>

4
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>but I start from the insight that most</v>
<v Speaker 1>versions of the way the world works,</v>

5
00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:35.200
<v Speaker 1>that a highly [inaudible] of the sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one encounters in the social and</v>

6
00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:38.500
<v Speaker 1>political sciences are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't capture anything like the</v>

7
00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:42.310
<v Speaker 1>complexity of the historical process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're often actually deeply</v>

8
00:00:42.311 --> 00:00:44.710
<v Speaker 1>misleading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the democratic peace theory,</v>

9
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.900
<v Speaker 1>the theory that if all Paris were</v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic,</v>

10
00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:49.120
<v Speaker 1>that would be no war because democracies</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't make war.</v>

11
00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:51.640
<v Speaker 1>That there's an enormous literature on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and most of it is rubbish.</v>

12
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.180
<v Speaker 1>It comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No in no way close to describing the</v>

13
00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:57.160
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A great deal of Ford has written about</v>

14
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.540
<v Speaker 1>the economic process is very good</v>
<v Speaker 1>applied mathematics that simply doesn't</v>

15
00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:05.200
<v Speaker 1>describe this world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It described another imaginary world of</v>

16
00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:08.500
<v Speaker 1>perfect information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quiddity and a whole range of other</v>

17
00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:09.760
<v Speaker 1>assumptions that don't pertain.</v>

18
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.240
<v Speaker 1>So my initial insight is this world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly complicated.</v>

19
00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:16.030
<v Speaker 1>It works in very strange ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are all kinds of,</v>

20
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonlinearities which aren't captured by,</v>

21
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the simplifying models that social</v>

22
00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:25.600
<v Speaker 1>scientists posit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we can understand the world better</v>

23
00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:28.360
<v Speaker 1>and get a little closer to seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.260
<v Speaker 1>how uncertain and complex it's workings</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

25
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.710
<v Speaker 1>then we may stand a chance of avoiding</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kinds of disaster that characterized</v>

26
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:40.810
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have studied 20th century disasters.</v>

27
00:01:40.811 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>It's been one of my major interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about the German hyperinflation.</v>

28
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.660
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a book about the first World</v>
<v Speaker 1>War.</v>

29
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Then I wrote a book about the Second</v>
<v Speaker 1>World War.</v>

30
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm engaged in writing through my</v>
<v Speaker 1>biography of Kissinger,</v>

31
00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:55.330
<v Speaker 1>a book about the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

32
00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>and that's a lot of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manmade death due to organize lethal</v>

33
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.210
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

34
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.010
<v Speaker 1>and if you can work out why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say between 118,</v>

35
00:02:06.011 --> 00:02:09.490
<v Speaker 1>200 million people died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violent desks and the 20th century.</v>

36
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.140
<v Speaker 1>And that shouldn't have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

37
00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Because the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was supposed to be a century of</v>

38
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.090
<v Speaker 1>unparalleled economic and scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

39
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.520
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet it was also a century in which</v>

40
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:23.170
<v Speaker 1>to horrendous violence occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that violence that emanated from</v>

41
00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:24.940
<v Speaker 1>some of the most sophisticated</v>
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>

42
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Figuring out why that happened seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pretty important undertaking</v>

43
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.470
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly wouldn't put it up there</v>

44
00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:35.710
<v Speaker 1>with finding a cure for cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's what I do.</v>

45
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my hope is that each time I write a</v>

46
00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:39.694
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

47
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.840
<v Speaker 1>I've had at least added some small</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount to or understanding of,</v>

48
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.980
<v Speaker 1>of what went wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that motivates me is,</v>

49
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an interesting,</v>

50
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.530
<v Speaker 1>the things that work because I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an economic historian first and</v>

51
00:02:53.531 --> 00:02:56.110
<v Speaker 1>foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and particularly a financial historian.</v>

52
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by the extraordinary</v>
<v Speaker 1>success capitalism as a way of</v>

53
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>organizing economic activity.</v>

54
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm especially fascinated in the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that financial systems have arisen in</v>

55
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 1>certain places at certain times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

56
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>and the benefits that they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>conferred in the sense that through a</v>

57
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 1>good financial system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get resources better allocated than</v>

58
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.800
<v Speaker 1>in the absence of one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

59
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>so another part of what I do is to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>and understand that better because when</v>

60
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>we're not fighting wars where usually</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught up in the,</v>

61
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary ups and downs,</v>

62
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of financial markets and processes like</v>

63
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 1>globalization but are not new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talk about them as if they're new,</v>

64
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>but actually quite old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to at least 1700.</v>

65
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these are the things that get me out</v>

66
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 1>of bed in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to understand that stuff</v>

67
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why the wars?</v>

68
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Why the stock market bubbles and busts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 1>in the hope that a historical approach</v>
<v Speaker 1>to these problems will actually yield</v>

70
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 1>better insights than some of the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>approaches that people take.</v>

71
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.270
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
