1
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.960
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no dogma,</v>

2
00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:10.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even like I said,</v>

3
00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:14.570
<v Speaker 1>it uses iconography and symbolism from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:14.571 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>things like gnostic Christianity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Esoteric Judaism,</v>

5
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:19.730
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't require you to believe in</v>

6
00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:22.580
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason that uses a symbolism is,</v>

7
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

8
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:25.220
<v Speaker 1>in the part of the country that I grew</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in,</v>

9
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.150
<v Speaker 1>there are literally places where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to a four way stop and there are</v>

10
00:00:29.151 --> 00:00:33.080
<v Speaker 1>churches on all four corners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even if you're completely atheist,</v>

11
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.570
<v Speaker 1>even if you're repelled by these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are still part of your psyche still</v>

12
00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.100
<v Speaker 1>part of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our culture.</v>

13
00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:44.270
<v Speaker 1>So we on some level respond to those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things in some way.</v>

14
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean we necessarily have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in them for Magic to work.</v>

15
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

16
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:52.550
<v Speaker 1>the people who devise these techniques</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to know what works,</v>

17
00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:53.990
<v Speaker 1>why it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it works,</v>

18
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>and how we can make it work better.</v>

19
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.060
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to believe in any of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>any more than you have to believe that</v>

20
00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:01.220
<v Speaker 1>your muscles are going to get bigger by</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to the gym.</v>

21
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.590
<v Speaker 1>I'll hear a lot of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:05.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in magic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll think,</v>

23
00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:09.440
<v Speaker 1>well actually what you mean is you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>never tried magic because it doesn't</v>

24
00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:12.080
<v Speaker 1>require belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you hadn't actually tried these</v>

25
00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:12.860
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 1>invested time and energy into attempting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do them,</v>

27
00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:18.110
<v Speaker 1>you would see that they actually did</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

28
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.530
<v Speaker 1>That it's not a a process of belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way that.</v>

29
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.330
<v Speaker 1>I guess one of the things that was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard about eastern traditions like zen</v>

30
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.070
<v Speaker 1>was you focus almost entirely on staying</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the present moment all the time.</v>

31
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is really,</v>

32
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.240
<v Speaker 1>really hard once you actually start</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do that.</v>

33
00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:37.670
<v Speaker 1>You realize how out of control your</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts are.</v>

34
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our thoughts chase themselves around</v>

35
00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:43.310
<v Speaker 1>like a dog chasing its own tail all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time from the time we get up until the</v>

36
00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:48.311
<v Speaker 1>time we go to sleep and a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern traditions deal with almost</v>

37
00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:50.840
<v Speaker 1>wrestling against that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

38
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:53.900
<v Speaker 1>every time you realize you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing yourself back to the present</v>

39
00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:56.240
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the present moment over and over</v>

40
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.430
<v Speaker 1>and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

41
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get a lot of results out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

42
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never found myself in the present</v>

43
00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:08.150
<v Speaker 1>moment more than I was whenever I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started the practices ceremonial magic.</v>

44
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:10.400
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it does is it doesn't really</v>

45
00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:13.520
<v Speaker 1>address that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead you're dealing like for example,</v>

46
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:17.390
<v Speaker 1>on energy circulation practices where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're circulating ci through different</v>

47
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:21.260
<v Speaker 1>parts of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to energize different</v>

48
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:23.420
<v Speaker 1>energy centers that run down through</v>
<v Speaker 1>your spine.</v>

49
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Doing that as a side effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You become more and more present and I</v>

50
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:31.970
<v Speaker 1>didn't even realize you know the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these practices say for</v>

51
00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:33.500
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lesser banishing ritual of the</v>

52
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Pentagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you would learn these things,</v>

53
00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:39.680
<v Speaker 1>traditionally the organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the order would give you these exercises</v>

54
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:41.270
<v Speaker 1>and they would not tell you what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do.</v>

55
00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:42.650
<v Speaker 1>They would not tell you what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

56
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:44.690
<v Speaker 1>They would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go practice this for a year.</v>

57
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Come back and talk to us then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're interested in learning</v>

58
00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:49.670
<v Speaker 1>more and going forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about it.</v>

59
00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Then whenever you came back they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

60
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:54.650
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what did you experience?</v>

61
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.650
<v Speaker 1>That's how they would know if you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually been practicing them or not.</v>

62
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>So I would these techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle pillar,</v>

63
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>the lesser banishing ritual of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pentagram.</v>

64
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.460
<v Speaker 1>And one day while I was in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bent over to tie my shoes and I</v>

65
00:03:10.971 --> 00:03:15.971
<v Speaker 1>realized without even trying to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the present moment and it was</v>

66
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.440
<v Speaker 1>almost like an atomic bomb going off</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was for the very first time</v>

67
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.950
<v Speaker 1>in my life I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

68
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm completely in the present moment.</v>

69
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second you think that it shattered</v>

70
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.280
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're back to thinking or whatever.</v>

71
00:03:31.281 --> 00:03:33.860
<v Speaker 1>But it was even after years of zen</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>

72
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.210
<v Speaker 1>it was the first time that I truly</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced that and it was due to</v>

73
00:03:38.211 --> 00:03:42.080
<v Speaker 1>ceremonial magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the techniques that I use,</v>

74
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.100
<v Speaker 1>the analogy I used earlier about</v>
<v Speaker 1>flushing yourself out like a cup of</v>

76
00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:49.370
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a technique that flushes our</v>

77
00:03:49.371 --> 00:03:50.240
<v Speaker 1>thoughts out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

78
00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:53.300
<v Speaker 1>if you have a song going through your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head over and over,</v>

79
00:03:53.301 --> 00:03:56.690
<v Speaker 1>or if you're reliving an argument you</v>
<v Speaker 1>had with someone a year ago,</v>

80
00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.920
<v Speaker 1>if you're obsessed over something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get out of your head,</v>

81
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>this technique is good for that as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>as just general meditation purposes.</v>

82
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.770
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have a name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually just refer to it as the prison</v>

83
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:12.020
<v Speaker 1>cell meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

84
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.830
<v Speaker 1>but if you're interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that.</v>

85
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

86
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.680
<v Speaker 1>You start by closing your eyes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you envision yourself in a</v>

87
00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:25.290
<v Speaker 1>prison sale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Standing in the center of a sale.</v>

88
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Everything is white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The walls are white,</v>

89
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.220
<v Speaker 1>ceiling is white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The floors are white.</v>

90
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.760
<v Speaker 1>The only thing there is in the sale</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than you on the back wall is a</v>

91
00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:43.761
<v Speaker 1>slit of a window and it's up so high</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the only way that you can reach it,</v>

92
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.390
<v Speaker 1>the only way you can see out of it is by</v>
<v Speaker 1>gripping the window ledge,</v>

93
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:53.391
<v Speaker 1>high above your head and hoisting</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself up by sheer brute physical,</v>

94
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.570
<v Speaker 1>upper body strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost like you're doing a pull up or a</v>

95
00:04:57.571 --> 00:05:01.050
<v Speaker 1>chin up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to bring as much tactile</v>

96
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:03.960
<v Speaker 1>sensation to the visualization as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly can.</v>

97
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.990
<v Speaker 1>You want to feel it as much as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So picture yourself walking to the back</v>

98
00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:12.180
<v Speaker 1>of this wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressing yourself against it,</v>

99
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.250
<v Speaker 1>reaching up with your hands and gripping</v>
<v Speaker 1>the edge of that window.</v>

100
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Seal with your fingertips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to feel what the back wall of that</v>

101
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:25.590
<v Speaker 1>prison cell would feel like pressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the side of your face,</v>

102
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.570
<v Speaker 1>pressed against your torso.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel the coldness of it,</v>

103
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.760
<v Speaker 1>the grittiness of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you start to lift yourself up off</v>

104
00:05:35.761 --> 00:05:40.230
<v Speaker 1>the floor using gesture arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to feel what that would actually</v>

105
00:05:40.231 --> 00:05:42.720
<v Speaker 1>feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel the muscles in your shoulders.</v>

106
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Feel the muscles in your chest and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>abdomen firing,</v>

107
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.780
<v Speaker 1>tensing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you're pulling yourself up,</v>

108
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.460
<v Speaker 1>try to feel what the wall would feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as you scrape against it.</v>

109
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Lifting yourself slowly by shear</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength</v>

110
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>as your eyes crest over the rim of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>window,</v>

111
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.620
<v Speaker 1>white light burst through the window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>floods through the window,</v>

112
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.780
<v Speaker 1>and obliterates everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sale you everything until there's</v>

113
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:19.631
<v Speaker 1>only white light remaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it again.</v>

114
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Press yourself against the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>

115
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Reach out with both hands and gripped</v>
<v Speaker 1>the edge of the window sill.</v>

116
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Feel the muscles in your chest and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>abdomen and your shoulders tensing.</v>

117
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.310
<v Speaker 1>As you start to lift yourself up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel the wall scrape against the front</v>

118
00:06:38.651 --> 00:06:41.890
<v Speaker 1>of your thighs against the side of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

119
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.420
<v Speaker 1>As you hoist yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until your eyes go over the edge of the</v>

120
00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:51.130
<v Speaker 1>window frame and then white light comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>flooding in through the window,</v>

121
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.550
<v Speaker 1>obliterating everything you the sale</v>
<v Speaker 1>until there's only white light.</v>

122
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Once more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel yourself pressed against the wall.</v>

123
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Raise your arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hook your fingertips over the window</v>

124
00:07:11.261 --> 00:07:15.880
<v Speaker 1>ledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Begin to raise yourself slowly up by</v>

125
00:07:15.881 --> 00:07:20.470
<v Speaker 1>sheer strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling the muscles in your shoulders,</v>

126
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.470
<v Speaker 1>your chest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your torso,</v>

127
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.730
<v Speaker 1>straining as you lift your body weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel the wall of the prison sale as you</v>

128
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.620
<v Speaker 1>scrub against it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as your eyes go over the edge of the</v>

129
00:07:36.721 --> 00:07:40.770
<v Speaker 1>window frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white light comes flooding in,</v>

130
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:46.550
<v Speaker 1>obliterating everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of those things you can</v>

131
00:07:47.381 --> 00:07:50.650
<v Speaker 1>do for as long as you have time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it five times,</v>

132
00:07:50.651 --> 00:07:52.720
<v Speaker 1>you can do it 10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The longer you do it,</v>

133
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.560
<v Speaker 1>the more effective it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it gives you something to work with,</v>

134
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your visualization,</v>

135
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.270
<v Speaker 1>instead of just trying to stay in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>present moment,</v>

136
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.500
<v Speaker 1>which is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>
