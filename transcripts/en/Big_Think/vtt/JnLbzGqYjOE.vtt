1
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say the biggest challenge</v>

2
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.850
<v Speaker 2>todd as a woman in science is being a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom.</v>

3
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.710
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard work having children.</v>

4
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I tell kids this all the time and</v>

5
00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:21.550
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the hardest thing you've ever</v>

6
00:00:21.551 --> 00:00:23.620
<v Speaker 2>done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I've done so many space missions</v>

7
00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:26.860
<v Speaker 2>and Hubble and pro your big project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like all the hardest thing is being a</v>

8
00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:28.960
<v Speaker 2>mom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kids like 24,</v>

9
00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:30.310
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't stop it.</v>

10
00:00:30.311 --> 00:00:32.740
<v Speaker 2>It's always there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

11
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 2>as a scientist it's hard because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

12
00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:39.700
<v Speaker 2>my particular field of science and most</v>
<v Speaker 2>fields of science require quite a bit of</v>

13
00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:44.590
<v Speaker 2>dedication to whether it's laboratory</v>
<v Speaker 2>work or in my case telescopic work.</v>

14
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm where I need to go places and do</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

15
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having high quality daycare is by far</v>

16
00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:54.790
<v Speaker 2>the most important thing you can do when</v>
<v Speaker 2>your kids are little.</v>

17
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

18
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I relocated,</v>

19
00:00:58.121 --> 00:01:00.910
<v Speaker 2>I spent more time looking for daycare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I did looking for a house,</v>

20
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.530
<v Speaker 2>it was much more important to have good</v>
<v Speaker 2>daycare and I was fortunate to find high</v>

21
00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:07.900
<v Speaker 2>quality daycare where I just totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>trusted it.</v>

22
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Then my kids were great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They the absolutely fantastic kids doing</v>

23
00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:15.580
<v Speaker 2>super jobs now and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wonderful.</v>

24
00:01:15.581 --> 00:01:17.740
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to spend a lot of time and energy</v>

25
00:01:17.741 --> 00:01:22.741
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also learned you must rely on friends</v>

26
00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:26.380
<v Speaker 2>and family to help you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do it on your own.</v>

27
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this people like y'all,</v>

28
00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:29.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you do it?</v>

29
00:01:29.351 --> 00:01:31.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well my neighbors,</v>

30
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 2>my mom helps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.150
<v Speaker 2>I just rely on other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way it has to be.</v>

32
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you just go nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

33
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.120
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a tough balancing act and I also</v>

34
00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:46.480
<v Speaker 2>learned that there is no such thing as</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance that,</v>

35
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on any individual day your life is</v>

36
00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:54.250
<v Speaker 2>completely skewed one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One day you're like dealing with child</v>

37
00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:57.850
<v Speaker 2>crises and you're just coping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the next day,</v>

38
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may be dealing with a work crisis</v>

39
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.010
<v Speaker 2>and just dealing with that over the long</v>
<v Speaker 2>run,</v>

40
00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:05.080
<v Speaker 2>you have to find sort of the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance,</v>

41
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.950
<v Speaker 2>but you can't expect it to balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ended the individual moment cause it</v>

42
00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:11.430
<v Speaker 2>won't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once you learn to give that up lunch</v>

43
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:13.300
<v Speaker 2>and learn to give up the myth of</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance,</v>

44
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be a much more relaxed.</v>

45
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would encourage anybody who's</v>

46
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.800
<v Speaker 1>interested in any kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

47
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.090
<v Speaker 2>if science engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>math field to go after that.</v>

48
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not about telling people,</v>

49
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.760
<v Speaker 2>become astronomers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need a lot of astronomers,</v>

50
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.740
<v Speaker 2>but what I want to avoid is that young</v>
<v Speaker 2>young woman coming along who was</v>

51
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.510
<v Speaker 2>absolutely fascinated in biochemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's told,</v>

52
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biochemistry.</v>

53
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.020
<v Speaker 2>That's the guy's field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's wrong.</v>

54
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

55
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:51.460
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best compliment I ever had was a</v>

56
00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:54.580
<v Speaker 2>young person who I just met standing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>line to go to a concert.</v>

57
00:02:54.581 --> 00:02:57.910
<v Speaker 2>It was like two years after the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoemaker levy nine thing where I had</v>

58
00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:00.710
<v Speaker 2>been in the news a lot and this guy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

59
00:03:00.711 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 2>we were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting to get into the concert and he</v>

60
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:04.010
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have love.</v>

61
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I introduced myself,</v>

62
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Heidi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you,</v>

63
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Heidi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heidi humble,</v>

64
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 2>the astronomer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

65
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.571
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's me.</v>

66
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:11.404
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

67
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 2>you're the reason I became a biologist.</v>

68
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

69
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 2>How'd that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

70
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you did that comment,</v>

71
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 2>crash thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought that was so cool and I</v>

72
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 2>had really slacked off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dropped out of college and I was just,</v>

73
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a slacker.</v>

74
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 2>But I was so excited by that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I went back to college and I took</v>

75
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:34.290
<v Speaker 2>astronomy courses and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

76
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

77
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I hated astronomy.</v>

78
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

79
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 2>it's not for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

80
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.790
<v Speaker 2>I love biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then went on to get my phd in</v>

81
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 2>biology and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

82
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

83
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 2>That's my message is don't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>discouraged by anything anybody tells</v>

84
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

85
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:54.190
<v Speaker 2>In my case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the science thing.</v>

86
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 2>And I just ignored people who said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

87
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 2>girls don't do that and what blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

88
00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:59.140
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just went ahead and did it anyway.</v>

89
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lack of fear,</v>

90
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 2>stupidity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I just kept doing it,</v>

91
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.150
<v Speaker 2>but to tell young people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't listen to those folks that you</v>

92
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:07.984
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>

93
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.940
<v Speaker 1>If you want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the message.</v>
