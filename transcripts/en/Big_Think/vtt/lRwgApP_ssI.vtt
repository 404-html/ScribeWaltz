1
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Controlled for a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are dangerous.</v>

2
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Drugs are wonderful drugs when you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a medical need for them.</v>

3
00:00:14.591 --> 00:00:16.690
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the medical needs have</v>

4
00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:19.000
<v Speaker 1>disappeared over the years for anabolic</v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids,</v>

5
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>radios,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other drugs,</v>

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.870
<v Speaker 1>what are anabolic steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anabolic steroids,</v>

7
00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 1>and nothing more or less than synthetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>derivatives of the male hormone,</v>

8
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.290
<v Speaker 1>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:30.830
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.150
<v Speaker 1>molecules have been modified for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of reasons where she can get</v>

11
00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:37.410
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fundamentally a,</v>

12
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>they're all variations of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone molecule and you know,</v>

13
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 1>we have a surgeon that and puberty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it levels off or people have taken</v>

14
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>a anabolic steroids to try to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than they otherwise would be.</v>

15
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.900
<v Speaker 1>So they're looking for increased</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>

16
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.280
<v Speaker 1>improve recovery time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more aggressiveness and assertiveness.</v>

17
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.970
<v Speaker 1>A more acceleration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.280
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does work.</v>

19
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.060
<v Speaker 1>It can't just take the anabolic steroid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to sleep,</v>

20
00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:14.600
<v Speaker 1>wake up stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

21
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.530
<v Speaker 1>you do have to work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to put your muscles under</v>

22
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.780
<v Speaker 1>stress and resistive exercises.</v>

23
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.470
<v Speaker 1>You have to be in a high protein diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a big debate for many</v>

24
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.760
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The American Medical Association for</v>

25
00:01:24.761 --> 00:01:26.620
<v Speaker 1>years did nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.170
<v Speaker 1>the athletes knew better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It clearly does work,</v>

27
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.090
<v Speaker 1>but it is clearly dangerous and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>side effects can be in the short term,</v>

28
00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Speaker 1>the long term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some are protected,</v>

29
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.370
<v Speaker 1>some are not protectable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of all the secondary sex</v>

30
00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:43.270
<v Speaker 1>characteristics and effects on other</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the body.</v>

31
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychiatric effects.</v>

32
00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:48.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a profound depression when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop these drugs.</v>

33
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about that later as well,</v>

34
00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:56.161
<v Speaker 1>but there's a for teenagers as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular concern in that they will</v>

35
00:01:56.651 --> 00:01:58.960
<v Speaker 1>close their growth centers and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>long bones,</v>

36
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.770
<v Speaker 1>so they never achieved there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're genetically determined height.</v>

37
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.710
<v Speaker 1>They're going to permanently shorter</v>
<v Speaker 1>than they would have been otherwise.</v>

38
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.650
<v Speaker 1>And for teenagers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very importantly,</v>

39
00:02:08.651 --> 00:02:11.770
<v Speaker 1>as well as other abuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>severe acne is coming.</v>

40
00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:13.840
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of the package as well.</v>

41
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.220
<v Speaker 1>There are some effects that could affect</v>
<v Speaker 1>a teenager's men and women alike.</v>

42
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Are those things that affect women?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

43
00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:31.000
<v Speaker 1>those things were fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teenagers and those things that affect</v>

44
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 1>males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The simplest term a male becomes</v>

45
00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:37.600
<v Speaker 1>feminized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

46
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Because in the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone is transformed into the</v>

47
00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:45.310
<v Speaker 1>female hormone estrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you'll see a high pitched voice,</v>

48
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>development of breasts,</v>

49
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.250
<v Speaker 1>a shrinkage of their testicles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A changing their hair patterns,</v>

50
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.850
<v Speaker 1>they literally become feminized while</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to get increasingly</v>

51
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>masculinized sort of a strange paradox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also get bigger and stronger,</v>

52
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>but they also get families and some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those changes permanent.</v>

53
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Conversely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman that takes anabolic steroids</v>

54
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 1>becomes masculinized associated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will develop a deep voice,</v>

55
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>develop facial hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a clitoral enlargement,</v>

56
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>menstrual irregularities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>and a large Adam's apple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

58
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 1>so they've very much become the</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction of a male.</v>

59
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>And as far as teenagers a concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's unique to them of</v>

60
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as is the growth centers and the fact</v>

61
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>that they never reached their full</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic potential if they take these</v>

62
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>things long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

63
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each segment of the population has its</v>

64
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>unique consequences from abusing</v>
<v Speaker 1>anabolic steroids.</v>

65
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you a very concrete example.</v>

66
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

67
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.750
<v Speaker 1>about three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a phone call one day from Mr Don.</v>

68
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Don Hooten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who lived in Texas,</v>

69
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 1>had a son who was 16 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who pitched for,</v>

70
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.430
<v Speaker 1>for his baseball team in Plano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas was very good.</v>

71
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Coincidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a cousin who played in the major</v>

72
00:04:20.451 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>leagues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.680
<v Speaker 1>by the name of Bert Hooten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.460
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his coach said,</v>

75
00:04:28.461 --> 00:04:30.320
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to get to the major leagues</v>

76
00:04:30.321 --> 00:04:33.140
<v Speaker 1>like your cousin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just keep working the way you are,</v>

77
00:04:33.141 --> 00:04:35.600
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to get bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left the event.</v>

78
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Well being in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very hard to get to Mexico and</v>

79
00:04:40.431 --> 00:04:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anabolic steroids are readily available</v>

80
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 1>and so off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the son Taylor Hudl and in fact got</v>

81
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.270
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger acne and personality changed.</v>

82
00:04:57.271 --> 00:05:02.271
<v Speaker 1>Roid rage puts a visceral wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very significant breakup on his</v>

83
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.130
<v Speaker 1>relationship with his girlfriend's</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>

84
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.150
<v Speaker 1>for them around to various experts in</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what was going on.</v>

85
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.300
<v Speaker 1>A parents finally said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

86
00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:19.301
<v Speaker 1>you have to stop this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did one day and went up to his</v>

87
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.400
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took two belts and hanged himself,</v>

88
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>called me shortly thereafter and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just felt compelled to share this</v>

89
00:05:30.381 --> 00:05:34.490
<v Speaker 1>horrible story with other parents so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want up in a similar</v>

90
00:05:34.491 --> 00:05:37.550
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suggested to him that he</v>

91
00:05:37.551 --> 00:05:40.910
<v Speaker 1>established a not for profit foundation</v>
<v Speaker 1>educational foundation,</v>

92
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.990
<v Speaker 1>which will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.940
<v Speaker 1>devote itself to getting this message</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

94
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.570
<v Speaker 1>And that gave rise to the tail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hilton Foundation,</v>

95
00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:55.571
<v Speaker 1>which I'm chairman of the board and Mr</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] testified as I did before</v>

96
00:05:55.851 --> 00:05:59.120
<v Speaker 1>the hearings in Congress baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

97
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

98
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 1>at the Metro report you met with Senator</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitchell,</v>

99
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership in many aspects of this</v>

100
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

101
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:12.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're happy to report that makes me</v>

102
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:16.450
<v Speaker 1>baseball actually is granted in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>substantial amount of money to Taylor</v>

103
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.960
<v Speaker 1>who foundation to do what we call is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoot,</v>

104
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.970
<v Speaker 1>hoots chalk talks and which we will run</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all 30 major league stadiums around</v>

105
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>

106
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.720
<v Speaker 1>A session is devoted to steroid abuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevention and healthy alternatives to</v>

107
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.540
<v Speaker 1>using steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a long way of saying that it was</v>

108
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:41.450
<v Speaker 1>a very significant price to pay a in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

109
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:42.284
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

110
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we heard about the wrestling case of a</v>

111
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.260
<v Speaker 1>restaurant now when he committed</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide,</v>

112
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.010
<v Speaker 1>killed his wife and young child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

113
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 1>these are horrible stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not rare.</v>

114
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.590
<v Speaker 1>And then not unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

115
00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:02.591
<v Speaker 1>and most people don't recognize or</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrated on the psychiatric aspects</v>

116
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.660
<v Speaker 1>of steroid abuse as much as they do on</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the other aspects,</v>

117
00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:11.680
<v Speaker 1>particularly was doing baseball records</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the line.</v>

118
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:12.514
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

119
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 1>We have parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize that a teenager has increased</v>

120
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:32.030
<v Speaker 1>in their own testosterone and another</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual in the same age group may</v>

121
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.080
<v Speaker 1>have a rise because they're taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone or other anabolic steroids.</v>

122
00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:42.081
<v Speaker 1>So how do you distinguish a kid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was going through a difficult</v>

123
00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:44.460
<v Speaker 1>adolescence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took no drugs,</v>

124
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:50.210
<v Speaker 1>but as a lot of acne is irritable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing his relationships with his</v>

125
00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:55.590
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wants to look good.</v>

126
00:07:55.591 --> 00:07:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the gym,</v>

127
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:02.220
<v Speaker 1>how do you take that individual and</v>
<v Speaker 1>contrast that for a parent and I suspect</v>

128
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.810
<v Speaker 1>that their kid is using drugs and got</v>
<v Speaker 1>acne and going to the gym and doing all</v>

129
00:08:07.861 --> 00:08:10.440
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to a,</v>

130
00:08:10.441 --> 00:08:15.441
<v Speaker 1>be aware that it's a possibility in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>day and age and it's a sad thing to say</v>

131
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.750
<v Speaker 1>that they're adolescents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

132
00:08:18.751 --> 00:08:22.590
<v Speaker 1>maybe using anabolic steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also have to recognize.</v>

133
00:08:22.591 --> 00:08:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I can make that assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may be that the kids are already</v>

134
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.930
<v Speaker 1>going through a difficult adolescence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how bad it can be suddenly your</v>

135
00:08:30.931 --> 00:08:33.960
<v Speaker 1>parents questioning you and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors,</v>

136
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.560
<v Speaker 1>so if in doubt you have to seek a</v>
<v Speaker 1>solution with a physician and share that</v>

137
00:08:41.221 --> 00:08:44.610
<v Speaker 1>information with your physician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there are ways to evaluate</v>

138
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.640
<v Speaker 1>what's the tool is at play here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

139
00:08:47.641 --> 00:08:52.641
<v Speaker 1>for the average teenager it may be not</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obvious whether this is natural,</v>

140
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.090
<v Speaker 1>whether this is driving.</v>
