1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.210
<v Speaker 2>standup comedy is definitely harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3
00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:16.211
<v Speaker 2>I like being on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's always been fun for me.</v>

4
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm better than A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like people ask like,</v>

5
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.770
<v Speaker 2>how do you go up on stage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

6
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I could ever do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my answer is like,</v>

7
00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:27.140
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having trouble talking to you right</v>

8
00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:28.910
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's,</v>

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.540
<v Speaker 2>it's for some reason some people just</v>
<v Speaker 2>have it in their genetic makeup that</v>

10
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:37.541
<v Speaker 2>it's easier to go up and interact with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>group of strangers than it is to have</v>

11
00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:42.280
<v Speaker 2>any kind of meaningful interaction with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>

12
00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:44.090
<v Speaker 2>with a person whose eyes you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look into.</v>

13
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying that I'm a cold,</v>

14
00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:51.491
<v Speaker 2>heartless monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a little sick but still stand ups</v>

15
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.070
<v Speaker 2>harder because it's just you on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>

16
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 2>The great thing about the onion is it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>so collaborative,</v>

17
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost kind of take on this group</v>

18
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:01.814
<v Speaker 2>mind there.</v>

19
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people are really willing to</v>

20
00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:08.690
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice their own personal pet</v>
<v Speaker 2>headlines,</v>

21
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or their own preference on a joke for</v>

22
00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:12.890
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the good of the,</v>

23
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.810
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the onion,</v>

24
00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 2>for the good of the product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

25
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't think either that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stand up informs my work at the</v>

26
00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:27.460
<v Speaker 2>onion very much or vice versa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

27
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.750
<v Speaker 2>because they're pretty different in</v>
<v Speaker 2>style of the standup,</v>

28
00:01:29.751 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 2>tends to be a little more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

29
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.983
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a</v>

30
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.050
<v Speaker 2>little more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

31
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 2>kind of do this kind of character who</v>
<v Speaker 2>that exaggerates all of my own</v>

32
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 2>nervousness and neuroses and they tend</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a little more conceptual,</v>

33
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.340
<v Speaker 2>like as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a eight minute set,</v>

34
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.610
<v Speaker 2>then telling a joke and then telling an</v>
<v Speaker 2>unrelated joke and then telling an</v>

35
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:53.780
<v Speaker 2>unrelated joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

36
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of can't write jokes that way</v>

37
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.760
<v Speaker 2>personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to think about how do I want</v>

38
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:02.120
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this eight minutes to feel so that it</v>

39
00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:07.121
<v Speaker 2>says awkward for the audience as</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible while also being funny and then</v>

40
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:12.590
<v Speaker 2>sort of right to that as opposed to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a good joke that I will expand on and</v>

41
00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:14.570
<v Speaker 2>then find a segue into something else</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>

42
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 2>I just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard for me to do that.</v>

43
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one thing the onion has sort of</v>

44
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.430
<v Speaker 2>taught me though is how to actually like</v>
<v Speaker 2>write material and how to hit a joke as</v>

45
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:31.001
<v Speaker 2>hard as you possibly can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relentlessly until near to the point of,</v>

46
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.520
<v Speaker 2>of being too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So having that sense of something that</v>

47
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.200
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've really gotten from working at the</v>

48
00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:37.040
<v Speaker 2>onion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

49
00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:40.190
<v Speaker 2>over four years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the two are actually pretty,</v>

50
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.720
<v Speaker 2>pretty unrelated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

51
00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:43.190
<v Speaker 2>I do have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

52
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.970
<v Speaker 2>a website that I keep up as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called the Joe Randazzo</v>

53
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.803
<v Speaker 2>Association,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

54
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.950
<v Speaker 2>now that I'm saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this sort of large heartless</v>

55
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 2>corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

56
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.010
<v Speaker 2>and it's the kind of goings on at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>office,</v>

57
00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>messages from,</v>

58
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 2>from the HR representative and schedule</v>
<v Speaker 2>of events for a seminar and what the</v>

59
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 2>lunch menu is going to be and it's those</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of things.</v>

60
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the writing for that has definitely</v>

61
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 2>been influenced a lot by my time at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>onion,</v>

62
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 2>just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>

63
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.890
<v Speaker 2>how to really write a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's my own personal stuff because</v>

64
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you just need to write your</v>
<v Speaker 2>own personal stuff as well.</v>

65
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.360
<v Speaker 2>It's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also,</v>

66
00:03:29.361 --> 00:03:30.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>

67
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who has to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

68
00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:37.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you have to sit down and write</v>

69
00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:40.460
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the most dreadful feeling in</v>

70
00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:42.140
<v Speaker 2>the world for me anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

71
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also really fun.</v>

72
00:03:45.261 --> 00:03:45.870
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

73
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.770
<v Speaker 2>you forget when you're having fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you forget how,</v>

74
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.460
<v Speaker 2>how dreadful it is and when you're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dreadful,</v>

75
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.770
<v Speaker 2>you forget how fun it can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

76
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to write something in order</v>

77
00:03:58.731 --> 00:04:02.000
<v Speaker 2>to be able to have material to perform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's when the fun is.</v>

78
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I guess I sort of actually force</v>

79
00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:08.120
<v Speaker 2>myself to do it and I've listened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

80
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this great podcast I listen to</v>

81
00:04:10.491 --> 00:04:12.860
<v Speaker 2>called the creative screenwriting</v>
<v Speaker 2>magazine,</v>

82
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm Jeff Gold Smith is his name.</v>

83
00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.920
<v Speaker 2>He's a senior editor at the magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

84
00:04:18.921 --> 00:04:21.140
<v Speaker 2>and he interviews different</v>
<v Speaker 2>screenwriters every week and he always</v>

85
00:04:21.141 --> 00:04:22.880
<v Speaker 2>asks them if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

86
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.223
<v Speaker 2>what did they do?</v>

87
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.090
<v Speaker 2>Did they get writer's block and do they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they do to get rid of it?</v>

88
00:04:29.091 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 2>And every time I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ha,</v>

89
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.850
<v Speaker 2>I always have writers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but writers block is the default</v>

90
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.120
<v Speaker 2>position for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like such a struggle to get these</v>

91
00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:40.430
<v Speaker 2>ideas out so they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to come out,</v>

92
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.370
<v Speaker 2>even though they're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're driving me crazy.</v>

93
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also just an incredible,</v>

94
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.630
<v Speaker 2>incredible to be able to have a career</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of making people laugh and,</v>

95
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.900
<v Speaker 2>or a job anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's gonna,</v>

96
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.640
<v Speaker 2>if it will be a career</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you sit around in a room and,</v>

97
00:04:58.641 --> 00:04:59.070
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

98
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.010
<v Speaker 2>and make people laugh and then put</v>
<v Speaker 2>together something that's so great that</v>

99
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.900
<v Speaker 2>I can be so proud of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

100
00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:07.490
<v Speaker 2>when you see people on the street</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading the onion,</v>

101
00:05:07.491 --> 00:05:09.740
<v Speaker 2>it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really wonderful feeling.</v>

102
00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:11.240
<v Speaker 2>And I always want to tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at mass tenets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's me.</v>

104
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've worked there.</v>

105
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'd say it's got to be that the fun</v>

106
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.740
<v Speaker 2>outweighs the dreadfulness for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

107
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 2>But it's work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

108
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.300
<v Speaker 2>it's work.</v>
