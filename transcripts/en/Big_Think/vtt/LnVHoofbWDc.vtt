00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.190
<v Speaker 2>he was very good company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love his attitude and his style,</v>

3
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 2>but I think he had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable skepticism that peeled off</v>

4
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 2>layers of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology and a presupposition in a very</v>

5
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:43.630
<v Speaker 2>useful way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think human causation is brilliant.</v>

6
00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:45.820
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think hume's dialogues concerning</v>

7
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:48.760
<v Speaker 2>natural religion are just wonderfully</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant.</v>

8
00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:50.380
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that he,</v>

9
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.440
<v Speaker 2>he saw dimly</v>

10
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.853
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

11
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.530
<v Speaker 2>the scientific world that was beginning</v>
<v Speaker 2>to emerge from,</v>

12
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.450
<v Speaker 2>from Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was in a way following lock</v>

13
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 2>trying to open up that exploration for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mind.</v>

14
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had lots of great insights that</v>

15
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:23.860
<v Speaker 2>he developed with a very good.</v>
