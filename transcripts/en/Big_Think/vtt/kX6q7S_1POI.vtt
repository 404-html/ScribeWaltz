1
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Healthcare is the most information</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensive industry in the economy and it</v>

2
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>uses information technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the least of any industry in the</v>

3
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you think about where do we need</v>

4
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>information to most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's currently healthcare.</v>

5
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 1>You need to know what's going on with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the patient,</v>

6
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:29.430
<v Speaker 1>what they're allergic to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kinds of issues they have,</v>

7
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>what treatment options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet we still do things by paper and</v>

8
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>pencil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>storing things in huge stacks where you</v>

9
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:40.110
<v Speaker 1>can't retrieve them and they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>there where you need them.</v>

10
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Healthcare is amongst the lowest</v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity industries in the economy.</v>

11
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the well performing</v>
<v Speaker 1>industries,</v>

12
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>they tend to have three features.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The productive industries tend to have</v>

13
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>three features.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

14
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>they use information technology a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know who's doing what,</v>

15
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>why they're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how rapidly they're doing it,</v>

16
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>what the outcome is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to improve it.</v>

17
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 1>They're always thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use information technology a lot.</v>

18
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>In healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>

19
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have compensation arrangements that</v>

20
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>are tied to improving value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When employees create value,</v>

21
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:19.530
<v Speaker 1>they get paid more when when they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that don't create value,</v>

22
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>that they don't get paid as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In healthcare,</v>

23
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>you get paid for doing things for volume</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not for value,</v>

24
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>and third is they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They decentralize it so that changes are</v>

25
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>made by workers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Workers have authority.</v>

26
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 1>The famous Toyota model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any worker can stop the production line.</v>

27
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he or she has the right</v>

28
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 1>information and the right incentives to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that the cars are coming out</v>

29
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:44.070
<v Speaker 1>with the quality that they need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In healthcare.</v>

30
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 1>The frontline workers are so busy just</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting by that they don't have the</v>

31
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:51.600
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to do better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take those nurses who are</v>

32
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:54.000
<v Speaker 1>spending a third of their time</v>
<v Speaker 1>documenting things and say,</v>

33
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:55.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't we do better?</v>

34
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.810
<v Speaker 1>They'd say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just don't have the time to figure</v>

35
00:01:57.811 --> 00:01:59.850
<v Speaker 1>out how I'm so rushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't figure it out.</v>

36
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Healthcare has got to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to get better on the</v>

37
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:07.590
<v Speaker 1>information and where we've made a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>start with the recent American recovery</v>

38
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:10.150
<v Speaker 1>and reinvestment act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is spending $30,</v>

39
00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>million dollars on health it</v>
<v Speaker 1>compensation changes,</v>

40
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 1>which you need to follow that hopefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>in healthcare legislation that comes</v>

41
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>this fall that will say we pay more for</v>
<v Speaker 1>value and not just for volume.</v>

42
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>An organization changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freeing up organizations and helping</v>

43
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>them learn from each other so that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

44
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:26.214
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

45
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 1>I really can make this a high performing</v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprise.</v>

46
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't have to be an enterprise</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's got low productivity.</v>

47
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>It come back to the most productive</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses,</v>

48
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>the ones that have increasingly lower</v>
<v Speaker 1>costs.</v>

49
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Those are businesses that are actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most innovative,</v>

50
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>not the least innovative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the most productive</v>

51
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>industries in the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their industries like information</v>

52
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:53.250
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like retail trade,</v>

53
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>like agriculture that use technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>than most,</v>

54
00:02:56.041 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>but they direct it the right way for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think that healthcare reform is</v>

55
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>going to involve stifling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Innovation is just absolutely wrong.</v>

56
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>If we do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to open the possibilities</v>

57
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>for enormous amounts of innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just give you a different example</v>

58
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:12.124
<v Speaker 1>than what we've seen.</v>

59
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Take a take an antidepressant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drugs,</v>

60
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>just as one example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a well known fact that</v>

61
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same drug will work on some patients</v>

62
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:28.771
<v Speaker 1>and not work on others is give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give people paxil or give people a</v>

63
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Prozac or give them selects or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

64
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Some patients respond to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other patients out,</v>

65
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>and it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people respond to one medication,</v>

66
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>some people respond to another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people respond to a third but not</v>

67
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>to the others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

68
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>

69
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>There's surely something biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

70
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>When you switch people from one drug to</v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

71
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wind up,</v>

72
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.793
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

73
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting them to respond to getting</v>

74
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well with a little bit of innovation</v>

75
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 1>will be able to figure out which</v>
<v Speaker 1>patients will respond better to which</v>

76
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:57.850
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

77
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 1>we can avoid giving people drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to respond to wasting</v>

78
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasting treatment.</v>

79
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 1>The people don't come back because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is not working.</v>

80
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Even worse with some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemotherapy agents where the patient</v>

81
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.140
<v Speaker 1>dies in the interim with innovation will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to figure out how to tailor what</v>

82
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>you need once you get to what you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>in addition to all the other things</v>

83
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:20.200
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll have the medical care system</v>

84
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:24.520
<v Speaker 1>that's actually customized for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just for something generic,</v>

85
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:25.151
<v Speaker 1>not just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

86
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 1>we just start on this because this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do,</v>

87
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't respond better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your responsibility for figuring</v>

88
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 1>out how to do something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just one example of where we're</v>

89
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 1>going to need a lot of innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Healthcare reform has to encourage</v>

90
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:41.270
<v Speaker 1>innovation across the board or else it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to say.</v>
