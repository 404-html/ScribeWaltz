1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Very much believe that they should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an important component and we</v>

2
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>mustn't let that slip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does a certain amount of feeling does</v>

3
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:11.010
<v Speaker 1>a financial crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we really afford?</v>

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.270
<v Speaker 1>We have to because we have a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>connected world and what what's</v>

5
00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:19.080
<v Speaker 1>happening in other parts of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>will ultimately affect us unless you</v>

6
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:24.081
<v Speaker 1>have social stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is in the outcome document of this</v>

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.200
<v Speaker 1>summer that there must be a recommitment</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the 0.7% of GDP,</v>

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.700
<v Speaker 1>which is actually not a great amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>given the potential of being able to</v>

9
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.780
<v Speaker 1>have a safer and more balanced world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also know now that the way in which</v>

10
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 1>we're living our lives based on carbon</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the rich parts of the world is</v>

11
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>undermining development of the poorest</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts.</v>

12
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 1>And there's a commitment that was made</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Copenhagen for an additional $30</v>

13
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>billion a year over the next three years</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help the poorest and most vulnerable</v>

14
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that money as yet I don't</v>

15
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>see any new money being committed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>And even though there's a financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>

17
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>we can actually find the ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we need governments of the poor</v>

18
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:18.201
<v Speaker 1>countries to have a real sense of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to govern on behalf of</v>

19
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:19.944
<v Speaker 1>their people.</v>

20
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>They very much understand the stress and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worry and the day to day concerns of</v>

21
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:31.970
<v Speaker 1>people who have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.980
<v Speaker 1>terrible mortgage problems who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind on their payments,</v>

23
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>know that they have problems of school</v>
<v Speaker 1>fees or university fee fees for the</v>

25
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 1>young people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>

26
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same in the modern Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going through a very tough time</v>

27
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:46.590
<v Speaker 1>and many countries in Europe and</v>
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere.</v>

28
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have to see the connections in</v>

29
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:51.001
<v Speaker 1>our world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

30
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:55.110
<v Speaker 1>look at a country that has become what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call now a failed stays pretty well.</v>

31
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Somalia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have pirates out on the open seas</v>

32
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>from Somalia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a danger of terrorist being</v>

33
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 1>able to group where there is no law and</v>
<v Speaker 1>order and find ways of attacking,</v>

34
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.030
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are much more interconnected than we</v>

36
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>have ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in our total interests to help to</v>

37
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>create middle classes in the developing</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

38
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Then they will buy American goods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will want to trade to the profit of</v>

39
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

40
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.030
<v Speaker 1>so I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard when you're really wondering</v>

41
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>how you're going to meet the commitments</v>
<v Speaker 1>for next month and a real worries about,</v>

42
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.610
<v Speaker 1>about food as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

43
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a woman has said.</v>

44
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.560
<v Speaker 1>But in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:43.561
<v Speaker 1>I think any kind of sense of political</v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership now has to move in the</v>

46
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>direction of understanding the</v>
<v Speaker 1>interconnections between our world.</v>

47
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>And we will not have peace and security</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we do not have fairer balances</v>

48
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>because we're not staying at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>population level.</v>

49
00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.380
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go up from just under 7</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion people today to over 9 billion</v>

50
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>by 2050.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the largest increase in</v>

51
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>population will ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And many of them are in very poor</v>

52
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for stability for our own generation,</v>

53
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>but particularly for our children and</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren,</v>

54
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>we have to have the sense of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interconnected world.</v>

55
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>I still firmly believe we need to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>the commitments to development aid,</v>

56
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>but I also agree with an increasing</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of African leaders and others who</v>

57
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to bring ourselves out of</v>

58
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:32.800
<v Speaker 1>poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want fairer trade rules,</v>

59
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 1>we want some subsidies removed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That disadvantages and when we're trying</v>

60
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 1>to compete on cotton or sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. And,</v>

61
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we need to have more</v>

62
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>emphasis on access to energy for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>poorest.</v>

63
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that has helped poor</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries greatly is the mobile phone.</v>

64
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.340
<v Speaker 1>That was the private sector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 1>creating a markers in the poor countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the mobile phone.</v>

66
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it attracts markets.</v>

67
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.250
<v Speaker 1>It transfers money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does help.</v>

68
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Surveyance it's how you can do education</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

69
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>It's wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are 1.6 billion people who</v>

70
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 1>have no access to electricity in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>21st century.</v>

71
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 1>That's not acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you give energy to the poorest,</v>

72
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 1>they will be able to be more productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is that sense that age</v>

73
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

74
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

75
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look after your needs and not make</v>

76
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>the poor productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of us think that we have to have</v>

77
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:32.470
<v Speaker 1>much more emphasis on decent work as</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the whole approach,</v>

78
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.250
<v Speaker 1>including by the private sector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The companies that are operating like</v>

79
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Coca Cola or other companies in</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing countries must more and more</v>

80
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>look at their whole value chain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we create more jobs?</v>

81
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 1>It's jobs that take people out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty.</v>
