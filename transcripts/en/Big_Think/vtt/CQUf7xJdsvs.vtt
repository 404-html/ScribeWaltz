00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I can't answer a question like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.210
<v Speaker 1>you say you're optimistic and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

4
00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.480
<v Speaker 1>the world is full of surprises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Lord knows,</v>

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2001,</v>

7
00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:25.630
<v Speaker 1>we thought we had no enemies world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were on a course.</v>

8
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:29.140
<v Speaker 1>The only problem seemed to be that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stock market was a stock market.</v>

9
00:00:29.141 --> 00:00:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seemed to be a little bit over.</v>

10
00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:32.680
<v Speaker 1>And look what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The history of the course,</v>

11
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.250
<v Speaker 1>the course of the world or the course of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country at least change which</v>

12
00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:38.830
<v Speaker 1>affected the course of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think you can be too</v>

13
00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:43.831
<v Speaker 1>sanguine about what the future holds.</v>

14
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this age will be remembered as a</v>

15
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:52.950
<v Speaker 1>time in which America really struggled</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

16
00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:55.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a world leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

17
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.880
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>went into a new phase of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

19
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

20
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of economic development as it's,</v>

21
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>as it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it's technologies became more</v>

22
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Population changed from,</v>

23
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>became an older population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>began to become an increasingly Latino</v>

24
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a,</v>

29
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think those are the dominant.</v>

30
