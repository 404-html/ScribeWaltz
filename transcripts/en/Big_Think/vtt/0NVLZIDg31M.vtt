1
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:03.893
<v Speaker 1>Let's just assume we're out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>streets and I become aware with this </v>

2
00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>suspect has committed a crime of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoplifting,</v>

3
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.210
<v Speaker 1>not the worst crime in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the shopkeeper says,</v>

4
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:13.044
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy just salt stole 10 bags to </v>

5
00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>sequent the odor it and I can smell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy from a distance.</v>

6
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>And though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now I know why he needs the secret,</v>

7
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>the old one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even paid for it,</v>

8
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:21.894
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm basically doing my psychic </v>

9
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:26.970
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of them and I realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a real nebbish.</v>

10
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:27.804
<v Speaker 1>She's a real schlub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like not going to physically </v>

11
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.130
<v Speaker 1>resist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably does yoga.</v>

12
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:34.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's probably very new agey.</v>

13
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:36.690
<v Speaker 1>He probably balances crystals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>watches Oprah.</v>

14
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 1>So I know I got this guy in control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the sadist,</v>

15
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.673
<v Speaker 1>he's Damascus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably wants me to put a ball gag </v>

16
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>in his mouth and whip him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that kind of submission.</v>

17
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.343
<v Speaker 1>So what I do is I refer to the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>code of Magna Carta and as if I was to </v>

18
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm loving him.</v>

19
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>I say you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect who has committed a crime,</v>

20
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:55.134
<v Speaker 1>you are in violation of the penal code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So therefore I want you to wait for the </v>

21
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>police for five o copper squat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sit down and sit down now.</v>

22
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.040
<v Speaker 1>So he understands I'm in charge and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>likes to be submissive.</v>

23
00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:08.874
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's getting his jollies off while</v>
<v Speaker 1>his weight problem is I'm calling nine </v>

24
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>one one and the cops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.223
<v Speaker 1>Bustin donuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right that pound in donuts waiting for </v>

26
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:16.944
<v Speaker 1>the fresh buttermilk toys to come out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dunkin donuts of it will be waiting </v>

27
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>a month of Sundays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's enjoying being submissive.</v>

28
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 1>So Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no pain,</v>

29
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>no strain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

30
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.123
<v Speaker 1>Can I have reason to believe I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's been brought to my attention </v>

31
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.193
<v Speaker 1>that this Cretin with chromosome damage </v>
<v Speaker 1>has snatched the chain off somebody's </v>

32
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.093
<v Speaker 1>neck and it's not a little monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I could tell he hasn't been to a </v>

33
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:41.950
<v Speaker 1>lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God got conscious.</v>

34
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>He's not weaken soft in that regard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's ready to put up a fight.</v>

35
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>I could tell there's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>intensity.</v>

36
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm using my psychic parameters now in a</v>

37
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>general self defense costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would say,</v>

38
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>look for his solar plexus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even find his girdle.</v>

39
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Nevermind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's Goin to.</v>

40
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not even looking for a solar </v>
<v Speaker 1>plexus.</v>

41
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.361
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

42
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:03.000
<v Speaker 1>you want to hit a boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in his Adam's apple,</v>

43
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.380
<v Speaker 1>it drive his Adam's apple or the bridge </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his nose and he'll know not to go.</v>

44
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>You think that will be wrassling around </v>
<v Speaker 1>bridge of the nose?</v>

45
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Adam's apple as if I'm studying biology </v>
<v Speaker 1>to prepare to become doctor md.</v>

46
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.043
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I do is it's for myself or if they </v>

47
00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:19.504
<v Speaker 1>are a number of others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weakest point of any person is any </v>

48
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>cabs I gotta make his kneecap sing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ring and in fact his instep,</v>

49
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>which just walden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five pounds of questioning,</v>

50
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.093
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's guy who's going to be doing a </v>

51
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.990
<v Speaker 1>hopalong cassidy and then as he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling the hopalong cassidy,</v>

52
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take his head right like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

53
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:39.623
<v Speaker 1>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like down on to which knee that will be </v>

54
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He will be in the primal fetal position.</v>

55
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:45.264
<v Speaker 1>I really won't have to do much if I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pair of handcuffs on or if I have a </v>

56
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:48.414
<v Speaker 1>belt that just tie them up to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stationary object can wait for the </v>

57
00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:51.631
<v Speaker 1>police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>

58
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:52.464
<v Speaker 1>My problem is if this massive swelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can't find this steak or a piece </v>

59
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.893
<v Speaker 1>and to put the swelling down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could end up going to jail myself </v>

60
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to go over the top.</v>

61
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Use excessive physical force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though he is committed a crime.</v>

62
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 1>I have no special powers and privileges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not a police officer,</v>

63
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>so I have to make sure that whatever for</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use,</v>

64
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 1>particularly in this fact that he's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>snatched the chain.</v>

65
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't threatened to anybody's life </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if I'm violating him physically,</v>

66
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>he may go to jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get charged for change snatching.</v>

67
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.303
<v Speaker 1>But I may be charged with assault and </v>
<v Speaker 1>battery cause a copper may turn around </v>

68
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:25.590
<v Speaker 1>after munching on the doughnuts and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

69
00:03:25.591 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the right to Keller charge,</v>

70
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 1>have him arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once he hooks up with a lawyer,</v>

71
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 1>a b lawyer that they assigned in court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

72
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:32.891
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever think of,</v>

73
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>so in the Guardian Angels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could get a third of the action.</v>

74
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retain his sign on the dotted line.</v>

75
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>So you've gotta be very cautious under </v>
<v Speaker 1>column b,</v>

76
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Rules and regulations.</v>

77
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

78
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>enemy of society is intent on becoming a</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern day street warrior,</v>

79
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:52.171
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>K,</v>

80
00:03:52.171 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 1>a shy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he a k a suicide kamikaze maniac because</v>

81
00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>he knows he's going to j a I l and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to go out in a blaze of glory.</v>

82
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>He could have a bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could have a stick,</v>

83
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>he could have a chain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could have a ship pool.</v>

84
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 1>He wants to stick me right underneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ribs,</v>

85
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 1>which would cause me to bleed to death </v>
<v Speaker 1>before I even hit the ground.</v>

86
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.883
<v Speaker 1>Or he might have a tool in a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to make an instantaneous </v>

87
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>decision to move towards the guy because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I move away from the guy,</v>

88
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a good chance I'm going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit anyway.</v>

89
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:24.190
<v Speaker 1>And in the process of falling back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lose the aggressiveness.</v>

90
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.230
<v Speaker 1>He's on the attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him on the defensive.</v>

91
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Very difficult for me to get control of </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

92
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.553
<v Speaker 1>So what I want to be able to do is get </v>
<v Speaker 1>them into a position where I can spin </v>

93
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 1>them around and then</v>

94
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.110
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by moving one way or the other one I met</v>

95
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.950
<v Speaker 2>at that point of Ireland had a guardian </v>
<v Speaker 2>angel to the three.</v>

96
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:47.780
<v Speaker 2>We can take them down lickety split and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then by myself I can rest more.</v>

97
00:04:47.781 --> 00:04:48.960
<v Speaker 2>When they at the restaurant</v>

98
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.080
<v Speaker 1>now you see in the process of waking is </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

99
00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.310
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

100
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.060
<v Speaker 1>dastardly how over the top how </v>
<v Speaker 1>neanderthal of you,</v>

101
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.690
<v Speaker 1>but if this guy has a weapon and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just committed a crime with a weapon,</v>

102
00:05:05.691 --> 00:05:06.524
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The judge is going to actually like an </v>

103
00:05:08.481 --> 00:05:09.314
<v Speaker 1>accordion giving me more leeway than </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would a police officer who should </v>

104
00:05:12.741 --> 00:05:13.574
<v Speaker 1>know better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who should be in control of his mental </v>

105
00:05:14.841 --> 00:05:18.050
<v Speaker 1>and physical faculties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who should be able to immediately get on</v>

106
00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:18.884
<v Speaker 1>his walkie talkie and some in other </v>
<v Speaker 1>police officers to give them some </v>

107
00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:23.630
<v Speaker 1>backup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm on my own,</v>

108
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.930
<v Speaker 1>I have to use whatever force is </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary to protect myself,</v>

109
00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:27.764
<v Speaker 1>to protect other victims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect maybe in this instance even </v>

110
00:05:30.921 --> 00:05:31.754
<v Speaker 1>himself because if he has a weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may end up doing harm to himself if </v>

111
00:05:34.821 --> 00:05:35.654
<v Speaker 1>he misuses it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you how many times I've </v>

112
00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:40.950
<v Speaker 1>shown up at a location where the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

113
00:05:40.951 --> 00:05:41.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's face it,</v>

114
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.060
<v Speaker 1>couldn't connect all the dots.</v>

115
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Even if you tried for a month of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sundays,</v>

116
00:05:45.801 --> 00:05:46.634
<v Speaker 1>ended up shooting himself cause they </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the gun there in the belt and they </v>

117
00:05:50.691 --> 00:05:51.524
<v Speaker 1>keep it write me at the their thigh and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they ended up shooting themselves so </v>

118
00:05:54.591 --> 00:05:57.170
<v Speaker 1>many times because they already have it </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the trigger.</v>

119
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 1>It's already triggered the fire that </v>
<v Speaker 1>round that's in the barrel of the gun.</v>

120
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.693
<v Speaker 1>They don't even have the safety on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they ended up shooting themselves as </v>

121
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to run away from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were actually doing him a solid,</v>

122
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:07.544
<v Speaker 1>even though temporarily he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of strain and pain and oohs </v>

123
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>and Aahs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll worry about it.</v>

124
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.813
<v Speaker 1>He'll still live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to be room temperature </v>

125
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 1>and you won't be sued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

126
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 1>this is not something you should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>treated,</v>

127
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.633
<v Speaker 1>your own house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just something that you have to </v>

128
00:06:22.301 --> 00:06:23.230
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Practice,</v>

129
00:06:23.231 --> 00:06:24.064
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as if you were playing rock and </v>

130
00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:28.240
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a concerto on a baby.</v>

131
00:06:28.241 --> 00:06:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Grand Piano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>

132
00:06:29.891 --> 00:06:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I've done this many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times,</v>

133
00:06:31.481 --> 00:06:34.420
<v Speaker 1>so I wouldn't suggest it as a sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new jacket.</v>

134
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.390
<v Speaker 1>First Time citizen arrest are out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>a do gooder,</v>

135
00:06:37.391 --> 00:06:40.030
<v Speaker 1>who all of a sudden wants to earn the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Congressional Medal of honor.</v>

136
00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:40.864
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
