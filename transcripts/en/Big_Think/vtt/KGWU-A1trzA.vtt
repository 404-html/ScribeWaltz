00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.640
<v Speaker 1>For any problem your work on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a moment where the sort of maybe it's</v>

2
00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:15.910
<v Speaker 1>some model that no one else cares about</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's sort of all fit together and</v>

3
00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:17.650
<v Speaker 1>I found some simple way of doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

4
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.960
<v Speaker 1>There's also the models that people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard about,</v>

5
00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:22.420
<v Speaker 1>some such as the models about extra</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions,</v>

6
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.700
<v Speaker 1>something else that we did having to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a different way of communicating.</v>

7
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Supersymmetry breaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were a lot of fuel rica moments in</v>

8
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>that making it work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.890
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that we could all tied</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

10
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.190
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard for me to pull this out</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of the time when you're</v>

11
00:00:36.191 --> 00:00:39.730
<v Speaker 1>working on something that's that one</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that you get excited about.</v>

12
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I think one thing that surprised us a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ramen and I when we were working</v>

13
00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:51.320
<v Speaker 1>together was the existence of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of the existence of an</v>

14
00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:52.940
<v Speaker 1>infinite extra dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people had actually thought there were</v>

16
00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:57.950
<v Speaker 1>theorems that you couldn't have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>infant extra dimension that gravity</v>

17
00:00:57.951 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 1>would just look wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there was no consistent way to do</v>

18
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:02.570
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was really interesting because we</v>

19
00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:05.950
<v Speaker 1>came across this by working really</v>
<v Speaker 1>following the consequence of our</v>

20
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.340
<v Speaker 1>equations to the end and there was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>no mistaking that it was allowing the</v>

21
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:13.430
<v Speaker 1>possibility of if an extra dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was interesting to go back and</v>

22
00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:18.410
<v Speaker 1>see what assumptions have been made that</v>
<v Speaker 1>made us think or make other people think</v>

23
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.620
<v Speaker 1>that it wasn't possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just to see how the theory was</v>

24
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:23.570
<v Speaker 1>almost smarter than we were in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked it out.</v>

25
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.560
<v Speaker 1>So that was kind of fun.</v>
