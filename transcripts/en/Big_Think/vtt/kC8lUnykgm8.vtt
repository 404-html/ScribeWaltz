00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think judges at our level,</v>

2
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't think much about public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the Supreme Court does because</v>

3
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting example of a couple of</v>

4
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:20.914
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

5
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.160
<v Speaker 1>the court of Appeals for the Ninth</v>
<v Speaker 1>Circuit,</v>

6
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.930
<v Speaker 1>which is California number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then western states decided that the</v>

7
00:00:28.931 --> 00:00:33.931
<v Speaker 1>phrase under God in the pledge of</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegiance was unconstitutional and</v>

8
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.030
<v Speaker 1>that caused a certain sensation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>

9
00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:43.550
<v Speaker 1>it was just the ninth circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just the West in any way.</v>

10
00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:45.190
<v Speaker 1>It was subject to appeal the Supreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>Court.</v>

11
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the supreme court found a technical</v>

12
00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:52.450
<v Speaker 1>ground for reversing the decision they</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't deal with.</v>

13
00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:56.710
<v Speaker 1>The issues of religious freedom that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved was very technical.</v>

14
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the Supreme Court decided under God</v>

15
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:03.070
<v Speaker 1>in the pledge of allegiance was</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconstitutional,</v>

16
00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:07.490
<v Speaker 1>that would have a tremendous impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

17
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.820
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the supreme court justice is</v>

18
00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:14.821
<v Speaker 1>consciously or unconsciously</v>
<v Speaker 1>are mindful of the public opinion</v>

19
00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:17.800
<v Speaker 1>consequences of their decision.</v>

20
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.010
<v Speaker 1>But at our level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our decisions,</v>

21
00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:24.250
<v Speaker 1>we rarely have significant effect on</v>
<v Speaker 1>public opinion.</v>

22
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 1>So the response to the public is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not a factor,</v>

23
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt that judges idea</v>

24
00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:42.901
<v Speaker 1>ideological views and political</v>
<v Speaker 1>responses and moral feelings and so on</v>

25
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.210
<v Speaker 1>are influenced by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.070
<v Speaker 1>the temper of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the community.</v>

27
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.980
<v Speaker 1>So some of us think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.030
<v Speaker 1>we mean by morality is durable public</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion,</v>

29
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the judges will share the morality of</v>

30
00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:05.680
<v Speaker 1>their community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is ultimately a product of what</v>

31
00:02:05.681 --> 00:02:08.290
<v Speaker 1>people feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

32
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.050
<v Speaker 1>so public opinion has a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>underground effect.</v>

33
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.500
<v Speaker 1>The courts are all more conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

34
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.300
<v Speaker 1>than they were in the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's been an ideological drift in</v>

35
00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:25.570
<v Speaker 1>the country</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

36
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.630
<v Speaker 1>equivalently has been a change in public</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion that's affected who's been</v>

37
00:02:31.631 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>appointed as a judge but also affected</v>
<v Speaker 1>how.</v>

38
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>How'd you.</v>
