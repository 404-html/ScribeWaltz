1
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're learning ways to perturb the brain</v>

2
00:00:07.251 --> 00:00:10.280
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think someday that people will be</v>

3
00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:14.930
<v Speaker 1>sort of enhancing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of quote unquote natural creativity</v>

4
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:19.931
<v Speaker 1>to get people to be more like what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of as geniuses or is that just not</v>

5
00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:24.920
<v Speaker 1>possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the idea of the vision that</v>

6
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>there's a way to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

7
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring out the genius in all of us and</v>

8
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.890
<v Speaker 1>I wish that there was a way that in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>educational system that we could develop</v>

9
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:44.480
<v Speaker 1>ways to promote creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do actually,</v>

10
00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:48.860
<v Speaker 1>we're pretty good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we could be better that we could</v>

11
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.130
<v Speaker 1>teach people to take risks in education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could value more the,</v>

12
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

13
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>the person that takes the path that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the common path.</v>

14
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.210
<v Speaker 1>I think we as a society are pretty good</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that.</v>

15
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.720
<v Speaker 1>We can be a lot better and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the values of studying or</v>

16
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.280
<v Speaker 1>thinking about genius.</v>

17
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a way for us to think about cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

18
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.920
<v Speaker 1>let's get better at this creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

19
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's find that creative spirit in all</v>

20
00:01:21.891 --> 00:01:24.260
<v Speaker 1>of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's move forward faster.</v>

21
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes people think about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain has kind of a shortcut to all</v>

22
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.570
<v Speaker 1>these sorts of problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.000
<v Speaker 1>if we just understand the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we can just go right in there and</v>

24
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 1>just fix things directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas it is easy to forget that,</v>

25
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>education itself is altered to the</v>

26
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:45.560
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

27
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I think that we have to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>brains in the context of our society.</v>

28
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things about genius,</v>

29
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it's not just an individual or</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to brain,</v>

30
00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.190
<v Speaker 1>it's about opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about somebody who is given the</v>

31
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.460
<v Speaker 1>pathway to actually make a contribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's think of our art musicians,</v>

32
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.870
<v Speaker 1>most of us would consider geniuses.</v>

33
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Bach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beethoven,</v>

34
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Mozart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are people that,</v>

35
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were put in positions that allow them to</v>

36
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:20.780
<v Speaker 1>be creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The creative spirit comes with many</v>

37
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>things other than just the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it comes with opportunity.</v>

38
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:27.800
<v Speaker 1>It comes with resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with attitude.</v>

39
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the idea of not thinking of it as</v>

40
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:35.720
<v Speaker 1>something that the targets and</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual and separates them,</v>

41
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.640
<v Speaker 1>but something that joins us together as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quality that belongs to all of us.</v>

42
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it is true that when people talk</v>

43
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>about genius as they are other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>

44
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.390
<v Speaker 1>they're almost freakish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

45
00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:55.391
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that attitude really</v>
<v Speaker 1>deters people from taking the risk,</v>

46
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's a double edge sword.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The genius term is often associated with</v>

47
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>a person that really changes the way we</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it could fit with something that</v>

48
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:10.771
<v Speaker 1>didn't exist before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that changes the course of our progress</v>

49
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.990
<v Speaker 1>in some fundamental way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that person by his or her nature</v>

50
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>stands out and is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>

51
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>and yet all of us are different in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative sphere.</v>

52
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>And that by incorporating the creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>person into the mainstream,</v>

53
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be a way to encourage more</v>

54
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:35.524
<v Speaker 1>creativity</v>

55
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.470
<v Speaker 2>in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

56
00:03:37.471 --> 00:03:39.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been talking a lot about the</v>

57
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:43.230
<v Speaker 2>things that neuroscientists can't tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>us about genius,</v>

58
00:03:43.231 --> 00:03:45.360
<v Speaker 2>want easy answers and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we think,</v>

59
00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these answers are on the brain and,</v>

60
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.200
<v Speaker 2>and you're kind of warning us like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

61
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscientists suite,</v>

62
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.970
<v Speaker 2>we don't know all that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The brain is a complicated thing and</v>

63
00:03:53.971 --> 00:03:56.880
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a social thing too.</v>

64
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.710
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

65
00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:03.711
<v Speaker 2>what do you think that neuroscientists</v>
<v Speaker 2>can do to help us understand genius</v>

66
00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:05.101
<v Speaker 2>better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

67
00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:07.890
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the kinds of studies that you</v>

68
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 2>think would be like the best ones to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make us understand genius as,</v>

69
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.870
<v Speaker 2>as you think of it?</v>

70
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the study of individual differences,</v>

71
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a really interesting direction to</v>

72
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 1>take differences in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say there's some people that have</v>

73
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.660
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary memory and we can design</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments to look at the neural</v>

74
00:04:34.351 --> 00:04:39.351
<v Speaker 1>circuitry that's associated with memory</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategies and we learned something</v>

75
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:45.241
<v Speaker 1>about what makes one person better at</v>
<v Speaker 1>memorizing things than another.</v>

76
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.360
<v Speaker 1>There are differences in um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

77
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.450
<v Speaker 1>how well we do mathematics and how well</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can put things together and</v>

78
00:04:56.951 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 1>understanding the rules for those</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences is important.</v>

79
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.360
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that neuroscientists</v>

80
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.620
<v Speaker 1>have taught us recently is that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the brain are all so richly</v>

81
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:17.851
<v Speaker 1>interconnected and the extent to which</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are connected has a great deal to</v>

82
00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 1>do with function.</v>

83
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.690
<v Speaker 2>So we're talking about say a patch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>cortex over here and another patch over</v>

84
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:29.590
<v Speaker 2>here and there like cables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joining them together.</v>

85
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how well those connections actually</v>

86
00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:34.670
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

87
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.240
<v Speaker 1>is thought to contribute a great deal to</v>
<v Speaker 1>our individual differences.</v>

88
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Is it that some people have more</v>
<v Speaker 2>connections than others or bigger</v>

89
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.030
<v Speaker 2>connections or what's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are those underlying differences?</v>

90
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all of the above.</v>

91
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.930
<v Speaker 1>In some cases the connections are</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually more richly innervated.</v>

92
00:05:53.931 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 1>There are simply more of them in other</v>
<v Speaker 1>cases they to slightly different places.</v>

93
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other cases they're just stronger</v>

94
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:04.610
<v Speaker 1>connections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means there's less noise in the</v>

95
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those hypotheses are,</v>

96
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.630
<v Speaker 1>are viable options as evidence for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them and they contribute to,</v>

97
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>considerable differences between</v>

98
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.320
<v Speaker 1>performances or one person or another.</v>

99
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.170
<v Speaker 2>So if we start to get down to these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

100
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.410
<v Speaker 2>real kind of biological components of</v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity,</v>

101
00:06:34.331 --> 00:06:35.860
<v Speaker 2>of innovation and of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

102
00:06:35.861 --> 00:06:39.520
<v Speaker 2>ultimately what we might call genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering how can we start to kind</v>

103
00:06:39.521 --> 00:06:44.521
<v Speaker 2>of figure out like are geniuses just</v>
<v Speaker 2>born or are they made or what can we</v>

104
00:06:45.101 --> 00:06:47.980
<v Speaker 2>figure can even figure out what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>differences are?</v>

105
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.873
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

106
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.650
<v Speaker 2>was Einstein just a blank slate when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was born and he just happened to have a</v>

107
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.870
<v Speaker 2>really good math teacher in first grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

108
00:06:55.871 --> 00:06:57.000
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

109
00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.690
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do those connections,</v>

110
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.300
<v Speaker 2>what do we know about how those</v>
<v Speaker 2>connections develop,</v>

111
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.231
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

112
00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:06.990
<v Speaker 2>in children and teenagers and adults and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

113
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.620
<v Speaker 2>how the genes play a role in all that.</v>

114
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.910
<v Speaker 1>That really is the $64,000 question and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the question that we would like to</v>

115
00:07:13.951 --> 00:07:17.430
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does the brain do it and how do we</v>

116
00:07:17.431 --> 00:07:22.431
<v Speaker 1>help the brain do it better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that your question really raises</v>

117
00:07:22.531 --> 00:07:27.531
<v Speaker 1>another really important point and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is how much bigger are questions are</v>

118
