1
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>What are my feelings about serendipity</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus gumption?</v>

2
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luck versus elbow grease?</v>

3
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.100
<v Speaker 1>When do you give up on your dream when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you throw in the towel,</v>

4
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:18.800
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>there's an old quote that I attribute to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Waits,</v>

6
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:24.640
<v Speaker 1>but I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.130
<v Speaker 1>it might go back to socrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>luck is when opportunity meets with</v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation.</v>

9
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.141
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:39.141
<v Speaker 1>I've always found that deeply moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Megan and I talk a lot.</v>

11
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>My wife and I talk a lot about how lucky</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are.</v>

12
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

13
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.140
<v Speaker 1>we're both blessed with whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's beautiful and an,</v>

14
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an incredible actor and smart as a whip</v>

15
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a really talented singer.</v>

16
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can carry a great deal of luggage and,</v>

17
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can experience extreme temperatures</v>

18
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>for a long time without any sustenance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.070
<v Speaker 1>we have our gifts and somehow our paths</v>
<v Speaker 1>have taken us to places where people</v>

20
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 1>said we were looking for someone who can</v>
<v Speaker 1>carry luggage.</v>

21
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing a play about a donkey.</v>

22
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>You're the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

23
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:28.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

24
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much serendipity plays into it.</v>

25
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.140
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived,</v>

26
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I chose to live like an asshole for some</v>

27
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a tough choice.</v>

28
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Speaker 1>It's its borders on irresponsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

29
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be just this side of broke,</v>

30
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>so sometimes I'd run out of money and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to borrow a month's rent from</v>

31
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:55.500
<v Speaker 1>my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would then find carpentry work and</v>

32
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>pay my friend back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was just this side of being a</v>

33
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 1>deadbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was flirting with dead beat ism.</v>

34
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.480
<v Speaker 1>And it's a big question in Hollywood and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people make a lot of money off</v>

35
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:11.160
<v Speaker 1>of people's dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

36
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.580
<v Speaker 1>you can pay a great deal of money for</v>
<v Speaker 1>headshots and for acting classes and</v>

37
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:23.331
<v Speaker 1>coaching and life coaching and personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>training and all that stuff.</v>

38
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they'll all tell you.</v>

39
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there,</v>

40
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.440
<v Speaker 1>there are really gross people who claim</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have the secret,</v>

41
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to my acting workshop and I'll have</v>

42
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>three casting directors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're from,</v>

43
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them was an assistant on 50</v>

44
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>shades of grey matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.110
<v Speaker 1>and w whatever the case may be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a question people wrestle with all</v>

46
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will I ever make it?</v>

47
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Is it ever going to happen for me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When should I throw in the towel and</v>

48
00:02:55.831 --> 00:03:00.831
<v Speaker 1>moved back to Cleveland and see my</v>
<v Speaker 1>family and my children and my</v>

49
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>congregation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a priest with kids and</v>

50
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Cleveland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

51
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I can say is it's,</v>

52
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

53
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a very personal thing to each their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

54
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>You got to keep working hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

55
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about having a discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If acting is your bag.</v>

56
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:28.951
<v Speaker 1>I always tell people if they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I get my kid to where you are?</v>

58
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I say take up woodworking but also find</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever stage,</v>

59
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:39.091
<v Speaker 1>find the biggest stage you can that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get onto and perform in front of an</v>

60
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:44.070
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're doing standup or theater</v>

61
00:03:44.071 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>or musicals or sketch comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

62
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.250
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 1>start shooting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

64
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>now we live in an in an age where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can literally start your own TV channel</v>

65
00:03:55.631 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>right now using your gadgets and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just let the world tell you,</v>

66
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>shoot videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show them to people and they'll tell you</v>

68
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 1>if you should keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're good,</v>

69
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 1>if something's meant to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

70
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 1>when people see you on stage or they see</v>
<v Speaker 1>your videos,</v>

71
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 1>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy,</v>

72
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:17.420
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to somehow help you.</v>

73
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.850
<v Speaker 1>That was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

74
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>you can tap dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can play the Tuba that face you</v>

75
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 1>make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

76
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anyone drink that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>beer.</v>

77
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>In 90 seconds I'm going to call my</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>

78
00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:32.560
<v Speaker 1>He has a show called Jackass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get you on your way.</v>

79
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.083
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

80
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 1>I started in the theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

81
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I was terrible at acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be an actor.</v>

82
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 1>I thought I had something that I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertain people.</v>

83
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got into theater school in Illinois</v>

84
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 1>and I was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get cast with good reason.</v>

85
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.530
<v Speaker 1>The reason was I didn't trust myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

86
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was from the country.</v>

87
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 1>And so I tried way too hard to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone cooler than myself,</v>

88
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 1>which of course just was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was what they call bad acting.</v>

89
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 1>But I was able to build scenery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very athletic,</v>

90
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:14.080
<v Speaker 1>so I choreographed fights and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>theater paid me.</v>

91
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>I found that there's so many jobs you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do in the theater.</v>

92
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.140
<v Speaker 1>You can work in the box office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sell concessions,</v>

93
00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:22.540
<v Speaker 1>you can sweep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many places,</v>

94
00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:26.110
<v Speaker 1>almost anywhere you would want to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a creative position.</v>

95
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 1>You can start there sweeping and curate</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sweetening.</v>

96
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't look down on if somebody is like,</v>

97
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:38.560
<v Speaker 1>well you could start as a janitor if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to work at Nike and you can get in</v>

98
00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 1>there as a janitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>MPR,</v>

99
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 1>show people how creative you're sweeping</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

100
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever moved to that cabinet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Move that damn cabinet and sweep under</v>

101
00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:49.900
<v Speaker 1>it and let someone be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

102
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assumed that everyone has the quality</v>

103
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>of work that I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let people see how committed you are to</v>

104
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>two exceptional work when people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you don't do a good job</v>

105
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:05.060
<v Speaker 1>sweeping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that too.</v>

106
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to trust that person on</v>

107
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 1>their own.</v>

108
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 1>They always need to be told to move the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cabinet and sweep under it.</v>

109
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.843
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

110
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 1>if you maintain that sensibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you first of all make sweeping</v>

111
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 1>a lot more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweeping can be drudgery or it's an</v>

112
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to like have fun whistle a</v>
<v Speaker 1>song in your head.</v>

113
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 1>You can dance with a broom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really fun.</v>

114
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

115
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:35.681
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's a a video line I should</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about putting out all different</v>

116
00:06:36.201 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 1>genres of music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all different brooms,</v>

117
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.200
<v Speaker 1>sweeping for pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

118
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.580
<v Speaker 1>but when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you do that,</v>

119
00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:48.581
<v Speaker 1>once you are locked into that mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're open to when opportunity</v>

120
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:51.950
<v Speaker 1>comes along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done the work.</v>

121
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody wants to cast me as a</v>

122
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 1>superhero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is sort of a truism in my life.</v>

123
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.310
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've often said I'm athletic,</v>

124
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:06.050
<v Speaker 1>but I have often carried 30 or 40 extra</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds and I think,</v>

125
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.030
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to play a superhero.</v>

126
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.080
<v Speaker 1>And if someone would cast me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll go to the gym and get super</v>

127
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:13.820
<v Speaker 1>buff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

128
00:07:13.821 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 1>if I would just go to the gym and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain a discipline there,</v>

129
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.790
<v Speaker 1>then when someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

130
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 1>he's funny and he's the right type for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the superhero,</v>

131
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.520
<v Speaker 1>and check out those crazy less that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the work is done.</v>

132
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.240
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

133
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.240
<v Speaker 1>So serendipity involves it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serendipity has greatly helped by,</v>

134
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:36.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by elbow grease.</v>

135
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:42.330
<v Speaker 1>And that reminds me of another quote</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Thomas Jefferson.</v>

136
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:44.264
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

137
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.050
<v Speaker 1>that I won't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good look.</v>

138
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

139
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Something in the vein of a good luck is</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to come by,</v>

140
00:07:58.451 --> 00:08:00.250
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I work hard,</v>

141
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I f I find a much more susceptible to</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience luck.</v>

142
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.950
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say that I said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick Offerman said that quote.</v>

143
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Put that on a coin.</v>

144
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:18.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
