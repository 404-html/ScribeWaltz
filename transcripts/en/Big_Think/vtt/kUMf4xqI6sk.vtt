00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.500
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the products and services</v>
<v Speaker 1>that exist in this world,</v>

2
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.560
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it is truly staggering the</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of choices that people are given.</v>

3
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Speaker 1>There is this feeling again amongst</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that I spoke to who,</v>

4
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 1>who are known champions of simplicity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that too much choice can actually</v>

5
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>stifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>customers enthusiasm or,</v>

7
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>or stall the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the selling process because you're just</v>

8
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>giving them too much to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just do my own casual research and</v>

9
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a techie kind of a guy,</v>

10
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I look at like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Dell's website versus hps and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>apples and it's,</v>

12
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>it is quite extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at at Dell's website there,</v>

13
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>I might get these numbers slightly</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

14
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>26 distinct models of laptops.</v>

15
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>This was as a couple of months ago when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I last look.</v>

16
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>HP has 41,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it is an apple has three.</v>

18
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>And what's extraordinary is that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the PC category,</v>

19
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 1>share of market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple never gets bored and like 10%,</v>

21
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>but because they do these fewer things</v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

22
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their share of the profit in the</v>

23
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>category is actually more than hp and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dell combined.</v>

24
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.110
<v Speaker 1>So that lack of choice isn't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurting apple at all.</v>

25
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.770
<v Speaker 1>You might even say it's helping them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to dumb things down and</v>

26
00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to get people to feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they don't have enough choice,</v>

27
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you want to give them the right</v>

28
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 1>choices as opposed to infinite choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to make it easier for them</v>

29
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Speaker 1>simpler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think apple has done a terrific job</v>

30
00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are other companies in the</v>

31
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>world that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that treat their customers in that way</v>

32
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>where it's actually a way of giving a</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer more respect,</v>

33
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and demonstrating that you understand</v>

34
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.810
<v Speaker 1>what drives them because you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying we don't know what you want.</v>

35
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>So here's 40 things to choose from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're saying we get that you have this</v>

36
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>particular need and this is a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>solution for you.</v>

37
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>And that proves to customers that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>share their values.</v>

38
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>And when a person feels that a company</v>
<v Speaker 1>shares their values,</v>

39
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>they tend to give them their business</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that makes them more loyal</v>

40
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Speaker 1>customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of,</v>

41
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concern at there for apple these days</v>

42
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.880
<v Speaker 1>that maybe it's losing its sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>simplicity.</v>

43
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Steve jobs is gone and Tim Cook doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>share those same values,</v>

44
00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:37.360
<v Speaker 1>whatever that product lines are getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger and um,</v>

45
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>it's less simple to choose what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for.</v>

46
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Product naming could be an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is where I'm going to start</v>

47
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>sounding if I haven't already like an</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple fanboy,</v>

48
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean to cause I try to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective,</v>

49
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.630
<v Speaker 1>but I think a lot of it is the result of</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple just being the most overanalyzed</v>

50
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.483
<v Speaker 1>company on Earth.</v>

51
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Because if you look at what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing compared to what other companies</v>

52
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is vastly simpler.</v>

53
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I think what the real issue is is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.400
<v Speaker 1>audiences mature apple has tens of</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions more customers today than it</v>

55
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>did when Steve Jobs was CEO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're just,</v>

56
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>there's a wide range of needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

57
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve would never do that when certain</v>

58
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when in fact Steven did do that.</v>

59
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:28.190
<v Speaker 1>The ipod was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this revolution changed the way we,</v>

60
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Speaker 1>we listened to and discover music and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a super big hit.</v>

61
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 1>And then a couple of years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore ipods and nobody had any</v>

62
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>problem with that because that was steve</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs doing it.</v>

63
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.970
<v Speaker 1>So now we had a tremendous hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an iphone and now there are three</v>

64
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>models of I funds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 1>they still got one more to go before</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as bad as ipod was.</v>

66
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.100
<v Speaker 1>But the reason they had all those ipods</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason they have all these</v>

67
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>iphones is because each one is for</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinctly different needs.</v>

68
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 1>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a sign of complexity.</v>

69
00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:01.340
<v Speaker 1>That's just a company maturing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a larger audience and,</v>

70
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.020
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maturing a particular product line.</v>

71
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.770
<v Speaker 1>And the same is true of I ipads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got the pro version for people</v>

72
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 1>who need to create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 1>with the pencil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

74
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.670
<v Speaker 1>and you've got more of a consumer level</v>
<v Speaker 1>IPAD.</v>

75
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
<v Speaker 1>So those things don't bother me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Naming is a different issue because you</v>

76
00:04:21.381 --> 00:04:22.600
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get like an iphone,</v>

77
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a success and a success plus and</v>
<v Speaker 1>an se that doesn't have a number on it.</v>

78
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen when the seven</v>

79
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 1>comes out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it still an se or is it going to be a</v>

80
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:34.270
<v Speaker 1>seven s II and what does it have two</v>
<v Speaker 1>letters and the other ones have one</v>

81
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 1>litter and that kind of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does start feeling a little bit like,</v>

82
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like many companies out there,</v>

83
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 1>big companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of numbers and letters and that</v>

84
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 1>part does not make me happy as just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

85
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.850
<v Speaker 1>as an apple fan.</v>

86
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I think it must be a better way to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

87
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.773
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>could be just like an ipad or Imac and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not have any number attached to it and</v>

89
00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a year in parentheses when they,</v>

90
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 1>when they speak about it or when you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>service or whatever.</v>

91
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you just have an iphone or an</v>
<v Speaker 1>iphone plus,</v>

92
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds similar to me,</v>

93
00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who am I?</v>

94
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.030
<v Speaker 1>There's all kinds of behind the scenes</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why things happen.</v>

95
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:14.320
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

96
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 1>whether or not something is truly simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost doesn't matter.</v>

97
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 1>It's the perception of simplicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think today the perception of</v>

98
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:28.030
<v Speaker 1>simplicity with apple is a bit more</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenged there.</v>

99
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Those product issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

100
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 1>which may or may not be an issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on your point of view.</v>

101
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 1>But then there's something like apple</v>
<v Speaker 1>music that has been generally,</v>

102
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not well received when it comes to the</v>

103
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:41.044
<v Speaker 1>interface.</v>

104
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.550
<v Speaker 1>It's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's confusing.</v>

105
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do have to wonder,</v>

106
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>how did apple ever released that</v>
<v Speaker 1>product?</v>

107
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:48.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't they look at that?</v>

108
00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 1>And they have their super high level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their high standards when it comes to</v>

109
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:56.770
<v Speaker 1>simplicity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who didn't raise their hand and say,</v>

110
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you make that more clear?</v>

111
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the answer is there.</v>

112
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

113
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe some growing pains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe apple needs a,</v>

114
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 1>a minister of simplicity to oversee it</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

115
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:16.391
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that apple is losing</v>

116
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 1>its love of simplicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to anything,</v>

117
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Tim Cook says anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Ive says they're not just saying</v>

118
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 1>things to try to fool us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they talk about,</v>

119
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>making products that people can love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to have a simple product</v>

120
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 1>for someone to fall in love with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no doubt in my mind they have</v>

121
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:36.770
<v Speaker 1>the values they need to execute on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>

122
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 1>but I think they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

123
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 1>the fan boy speaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there'll be okay.</v>
