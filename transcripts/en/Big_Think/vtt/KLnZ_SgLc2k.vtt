1
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Let me start a different place first and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then come through exactly what you want.</v>

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was born in 1933 is that Adolf Hitler</v>

3
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>was being elected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chancellor of Germany and some of my</v>

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.770
<v Speaker 1>earliest images is that young lad in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie theaters in the 19 forties was</v>

5
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.280
<v Speaker 1>really the opening of the concentration</v>
<v Speaker 1>camps by allied troops.</v>

6
00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>And then more and more as the weeks went</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

7
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>film became available and we could say</v>
<v Speaker 1>these bodies being heaved like sacks of</v>

8
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>earth or something like that up on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trucks,</v>

9
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.300
<v Speaker 1>off the trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

10
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.733
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

12
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.310
<v Speaker 1>that frightened me a bit when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

13
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.180
<v Speaker 1>but it also impressed me that he had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>life could be a lot more meaningless</v>

14
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.610
<v Speaker 1>than we think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A not nearly so comfortable.</v>

15
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Who of those people thought a year</v>
<v Speaker 1>before that they would be so treated?</v>

16
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100 million people in Europe alone.</v>

17
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 1>I lost their lives by violence in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>

18
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:10.090
<v Speaker 1>So when I read Haig only said history is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a butcher's bench chair.</v>

19
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Sure sounded true to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

20
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

21
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

22
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of sense of the possibility of</v>

23
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:22.100
<v Speaker 1>darkness and chaos and meaninglessness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a</v>

24
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>cruelty and barbarity at the heart of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that seemed always to be alive in</v>

25
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:28.900
<v Speaker 1>my conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

26
00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember a time when it,</v>

27
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>when it hasn't been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

28
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>and then I studied for a long time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a priest and I,</v>

29
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spent more than a decade in a monastery</v>

30
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>is too strong a word because it's a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern now the order of the holy cross</v>

31
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 1>fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit like the Jesuit,</v>

32
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 1>they teach it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he run Notre Dame and Stone Hill</v>

33
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>College,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my alma mater and so forth.</v>

34
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.910
<v Speaker 1>But we used to pray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we admitted our regular schedule,</v>

35
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 1>regular hours of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long day.</v>

36
00:01:58.861 --> 00:01:59.694
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

37
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hit about four hours or more set</v>

38
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>aside for prayer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of it together,</v>

39
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>much of it private.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm alone.</v>

40
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:11.600
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are often days and weeks where</v>

41
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't have any feeling for God</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

42
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.900
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

43
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

44
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>I did so much doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But nonetheless,</v>

45
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I did wonder sometimes whether all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a fraud or a,</v>

46
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I kidding myself or deceiving myself,</v>

47
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>but I learned that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is a pretty common theme and,</v>

48
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 1>and you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be glad that these adult</v>

49
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>moments and they're learn too</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

50
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:45.981
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the text of St John's letter m</v>

51
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.780
<v Speaker 1>where he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that you love God and</v>

52
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.040
<v Speaker 1>either you wouldn't be in a seminary or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of,</v>

53
00:02:58.041 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>and if you didn't think you love God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how do you know?</v>

54
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not enough just to say that.</v>

55
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>And he said by this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know if you love God,</v>

56
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.010
<v Speaker 1>if you have love for one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the moments of darkness ought to</v>

57
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
<v Speaker 1>lead you to be more kind and receptive</v>
<v Speaker 1>to others,</v>

58
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>especially the ones that get on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>nerves.</v>

59
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the ones that are hard to</v>

60
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 1>deal with the gods in them too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all.</v>

61
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I say that just as a way of</v>

62
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 1>negotiating the darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that you suddenly feel lighter</v>

63
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 1>constellation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this seems like the North Star,</v>

64
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 1>this seems like the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the True Path and some favorite saints</v>

65
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carmelites mostly not mother Theresa,</v>

66
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>but St Theresa of Louisiana's and Teresa</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Avila,</v>

67
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live through this darkness were</v>

68
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 1>marvelous books about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>guidebooks homeless if you want.</v>

69
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.390
<v Speaker 1>And I think they're onto something real</v>
<v Speaker 1>and deep and into,</v>

70
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>and the Inter religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 1>you find in every religion you find the</v>
<v Speaker 1>deepest people understand this very well</v>

72
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.660
<v Speaker 1>and can talk about it very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more shallow people makes them</v>

73
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 1>nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I religion that intends to be</v>

74
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 1>universal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is meant to be universal as in</v>

75
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>different ways that Judaism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity or,</v>

76
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has got to be a shallow enough for ants</v>

77
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>to wade through and deep enough to drown</v>
<v Speaker 1>giraffes,</v>

78
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:35.590
<v Speaker 1>if you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gotTa have room for all types.</v>
