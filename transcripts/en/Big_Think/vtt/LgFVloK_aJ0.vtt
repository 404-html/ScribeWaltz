1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.580
<v Speaker 2>I think that researchers themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>could do a better job of trying to</v>

3
00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:16.940
<v Speaker 2>explain to the public what it is we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>

4
00:00:16.941 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 2>I would like to say that we need to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>more of this.</v>

5
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that the public,</v>

6
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.490
<v Speaker 2>if we take the time to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

7
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.390
<v Speaker 2>will have different viewpoints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course we're a heterogeneous and</v>

8
00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 2>diverse society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

9
00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:32.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless we do more of that,</v>

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't say that the public has</v>

11
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:37.430
<v Speaker 2>misperceiving if we don't give them the</v>
<v Speaker 2>information to evaluate.</v>

12
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.943
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

13
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.310
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

14
00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:45.311
<v Speaker 2>there are many elements that we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>explain and speak less than a scientific</v>

15
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.710
<v Speaker 2>jargon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

16
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

17
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually work a communication specialist</v>

18
00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 2>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get messages out in different</v>

19
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:57.380
<v Speaker 2>languages and different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.580
<v Speaker 2>different levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

21
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.270
<v Speaker 2>why not let fourth graders here about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing at the level of fourth</v>

22
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:05.360
<v Speaker 2>grader university students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical students,</v>

23
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.380
<v Speaker 2>medical professionals have different</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways of communicating with the</v>

24
00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:08.990
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

25
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.880
<v Speaker 2>constituents in society.</v>

26
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 2>There are many organizations now that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

27
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 2>because the public votes with their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

28
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 2>their checkbook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>

29
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 2>their taxes on the people they elect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to go to the public,</v>

30
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and particularly around public private</v>

31
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 2>partnerships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

32
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.740
<v Speaker 2>that we want to build from the private</v>
<v Speaker 2>sector with,</v>

33
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a civil society and with the public</v>

34
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 2>sector,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to be out and to say,</v>

35
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is,</v>

36
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what our core values are,</v>

37
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 2>what our mission is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we can do to be part of the</v>

38
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 2>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to take on the whole problem.</v>

39
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to build these partnerships with the</v>

40
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.593
<v Speaker 2>public sector.</v>

41
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.470
<v Speaker 2>I am worried that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

42
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.130
<v Speaker 2>there is mistrust between the public and</v>
<v Speaker 2>academia,</v>

43
00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

44
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.610
<v Speaker 2>with public entities as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but particularly with the pharmaceutical</v>

45
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:05.990
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

46
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.860
<v Speaker 2>so w we have many corrective actions</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've taken.</v>

47
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:12.500
<v Speaker 2>We are trying to respond and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>feedback,</v>

48
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.343
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

49
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.160
<v Speaker 2>on what type of activities we need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>improve ourselves on.</v>

50
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.740
<v Speaker 2>But I would like to see us on a much</v>
<v Speaker 2>more positive trajectory where it is</v>

51
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:26.480
<v Speaker 2>clear that what we are doing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>delivering what the public wants,</v>

52
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.710
<v Speaker 2>the diseases they want us to work on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the public has a lot of voices as</v>

53
00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:32.580
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we can't satisfy all.</v>

54
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the needs,</v>

55
00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:34.514
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

56
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly we want to be a serving</v>

57
00:02:38.061 --> 00:02:39.770
<v Speaker 2>medical need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

58
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.370
<v Speaker 2>in the way that public a regained some</v>
<v Speaker 2>competence in what we do.</v>

59
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.320
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

60
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.580
<v Speaker 2>many of the issues that the public has</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Pharma,</v>

61
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.710
<v Speaker 2>we need to listen to and we need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand those,</v>

62
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 2>what their issues are and we need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an internal dialogue with the,</v>

63
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 2>about these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When that happens,</v>

64
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

65
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 2>we need to negotiate a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a path out of that.</v>

66
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.170
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

67
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 2>part of the district trust was around</v>
<v Speaker 2>transparency,</v>

68
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 2>around data and publication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that data and frankly the safety of our</v>

69
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 2>medicines when we explain what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>safeguards that we do and the fact that</v>

70
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 2>we're a very highly regulated industry</v>
<v Speaker 2>more so than,</v>

71
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.040
<v Speaker 2>than most industries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And get out with what we're doing that</v>

72
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 2>to show that we've heard what they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>said to us and then what are our plan</v>

73
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:33.750
<v Speaker 2>are and then to ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what you had in mind about our,</v>

74
00:03:33.751 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our corrective action.</v>

75
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 2>The other thing we can do is just talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the great science we do.</v>

76
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the lives that are affected by our</v>

77
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 2>medicines and our vaccines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the programs that we build,</v>

78
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 2>the disease elimination programs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the health management programs around</v>

79
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 2>our therapeutics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not just about the</v>

80
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 2>molecule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just about the vaccine,</v>

81
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 2>it's about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the disease management programs that we</v>

82
00:03:56.771 --> 00:04:01.771
<v Speaker 2>build into this telling the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asking our customers are our</v>

83
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 2>constituents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

84
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are we doing a getting feedback</v>

85
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 2>changing course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

86
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that,</v>

87
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.623
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

88
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't look at the public is having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>misperception of us.</v>

89
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.801
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

90
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 2>I look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

91
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 2>our need to have more of a dialogue with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the public and to evolve science.</v>

92
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.090
<v Speaker 2>It's about evolution anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a scientist,</v>

93
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 2>we should evolve with the public.</v>

94
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 2>Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to see progress in infectious</v>

95
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 2>diseases because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

96
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

97
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 2>we have A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>HIV is still a raging pandemic now.</v>

98
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not thought about as much in the</v>

99
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:39.970
<v Speaker 2>developed world because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

100
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:44.860
<v Speaker 2>in many Pharma and public private</v>
<v Speaker 2>partnerships working with the NIH and</v>

101
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:48.190
<v Speaker 2>other public entities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we now have turned HIV in the developed</v>

102
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 2>world into a chronic disease is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>treatable,</v>

103
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.290
<v Speaker 2>not with the best and not with optimal</v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine.</v>

104
00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:59.130
<v Speaker 2>So we still have room to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the largest part of the,</v>

105
00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

106
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.380
<v Speaker 2>the planet with HIV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

107
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.240
<v Speaker 2>until recently you had no access and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

108
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.690
<v Speaker 2>we were making great strides with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Global Fund,</v>

109
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.920
<v Speaker 2>pepfar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

110
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.940
<v Speaker 2>other programs that originated out of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pharma to get into some of the issues</v>

111
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Speaker 2>around access.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

112
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.821
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

113
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:20.830
<v Speaker 2>there are two to three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

114
00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:21.760
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

115
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 2>after HIV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Tuberculosis,</v>

116
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 2>malaria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acute respiratory infections in</v>

117
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc. Uh,</v>

118
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

119
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really deserve as much attention I think</v>

120
00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 2>as hiv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I woUldn't want to say one thing,</v>

121
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.280
<v Speaker 2>I would say let's have a grander vision</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tackle the top 10,</v>

122
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 2>at least the top 10.</v>

123
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Tacoma is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a historical disease.</v>

124
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:48.220
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's mentioned in the greek papaya ray,</v>

125
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.280
<v Speaker 2>and it's actually mentioned in the bible</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was in the us,</v>

126
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in appalachian on indian reservations</v>

127
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 2>after the battle of a denial when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

128
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

129
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.460
<v Speaker 2>nelson sank the french fleet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the returning navy and soldiers brought</v>

130
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:10.310
<v Speaker 2>tacoma to europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this has been a disease in the</v>

131
00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:13.160
<v Speaker 2>developed world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with improved sanitation,</v>

132
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the disease has gone away and actually</v>

133
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 2>on the reservations with some mass</v>
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics.</v>

134
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.790
<v Speaker 2>So until the poverty agenda in the north</v>
<v Speaker 2>south divide is a really,</v>

135
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 2>a solid tacoma is going to be a disease</v>
<v Speaker 2>that requires other modalities including</v>

136
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 2>antibiotic treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

137
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 2>but agaIn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that with the current</v>

138
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:39.200
<v Speaker 2>mobilization that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the disease is within reach,</v>

139
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.880
<v Speaker 2>tacoma is caused by a bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's usually crowding and in poor</v>

140
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:48.220
<v Speaker 2>conditions and with repeated infections</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the eyes,</v>

141
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 2>scarring occurs over many years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That leads to blindness.</v>

142
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>malaria is a mosquito transmitted</v>

143
00:06:56.721 --> 00:06:58.330
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

144
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually again,</v>

145
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the south all the way up to Washington</v>

146
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 2>and this country was a endemic from</v>
<v Speaker 2>malaria.</v>

147
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

148
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today 90 percent of malaria and malaria</v>

149
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 2>deaths are in subsaharan africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

150
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

151
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the parasites have the advantage because</v>

152
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:22.970
<v Speaker 2>of their sheer numbers and replication</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they become quickly resistant to</v>

153
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 2>many of the available drugs.</v>

154
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.630
<v Speaker 2>I believe a tacoma tHat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

155
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.740
<v Speaker 2>the global Illumination of tacoma is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is within reach by the year 20,</v>

156
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.080
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is our goals.</v>

157
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to the world health</v>
<v Speaker 2>organization,</v>

158
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow eVening to be part of that</v>

159
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:41.240
<v Speaker 2>annual meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

160
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.860
<v Speaker 2>that program iS being linked with other</v>
<v Speaker 2>neglected tropIcal disease programs that</v>

161
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

162
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.250
<v Speaker 2>many people in the field have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>working on it.</v>

163
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:52.880
<v Speaker 2>But for about fifty cents a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

164
00:07:52.881 --> 00:07:56.570
<v Speaker 2>with four or five already approved</v>
<v Speaker 2>medicines,</v>

165
00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.020
<v Speaker 2>we can look at eight or nine neglected</v>
<v Speaker 2>tropical diseases and imagine and</v>

166
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 2>actually set metrics around elimination</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's different from diseases like</v>

167
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:10.760
<v Speaker 2>malaria where frankly resistances as</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the,</v>

168
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.200
<v Speaker 2>the biggest concern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we really do need a full pipeline</v>

169
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.320
<v Speaker 2>from early discovery to a full</v>
<v Speaker 2>development to address the continuing</v>

170
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:24.050
<v Speaker 2>evolution of resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The parasites of the advantage.</v>

171
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will always be a need for new</v>

172
00:08:26.601 --> 00:08:31.260
<v Speaker 2>therapeutics until we eliminate malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't see elimination as a,</v>

173
00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.390
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a real viable strategy for malaria</v>

174
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:34.243
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

175
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:41.530
<v Speaker 2>Very often these are a bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vIruses,</v>

176
00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:46.871
<v Speaker 2>or parasites that were formerly a</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely susceptible to a therapeutic.</v>

177
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.590
<v Speaker 2>Many people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one such a bacteria is mrs.</v>

178
00:08:53.591 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people hear about it in the news,</v>

179
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.020
<v Speaker 2>which is methicillin resistant staph</v>
<v Speaker 2>aureus,</v>

180
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 2>when fleming first discovered</v>
<v Speaker 2>penicillin,</v>

181
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 2>penicillin would treat staph aureus that</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't last very long.</v>

182
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Other agents have been synthesized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including different penicillins,</v>

183
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 2>completely new classes of agents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

184
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.250
<v Speaker 2>and I would say now that staph aureus is</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty well served,</v>

185
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.640
<v Speaker 2>so what I would expect would be there'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a lack of a further discovery and</v>

186
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:27.570
<v Speaker 2>development for staff laureus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe in a period of time,</v>

187
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.610
<v Speaker 2>five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years or 15 years,</v>

188
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 2>we'll be back to the problem of not</v>
<v Speaker 2>having agents with staph aureus.</v>

189
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

190
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have gram negative organisms.</v>

191
00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:41.100
<v Speaker 2>So these are bacteria that are found in</v>
<v Speaker 2>water supplies,</v>

192
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:44.040
<v Speaker 2>especially in hospitals because of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>antibiotic pressure.</v>

193
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.950
<v Speaker 2>There were a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

194
00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:49.350
<v Speaker 2>if you were to get infected with one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these organisms,</v>

195
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:53.640
<v Speaker 2>there may not be a therapeutic that will</v>
<v Speaker 2>help any effect against those organisms.</v>

196
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.190
<v Speaker 2>These are the super resistant bugs that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you asked about</v>

197
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.370
<v Speaker 2>in New York city just to make the case</v>
<v Speaker 2>locally in the late eighties,</v>

198
00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:03.730
<v Speaker 2>early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

199
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was relaxed control of</v>

200
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:10.821
<v Speaker 2>tuberculosis and so that patients would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be admitted with tuberculosis hospital</v>

201
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:13.290
<v Speaker 2>for isolation and therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

202
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.080
<v Speaker 2>after two weeks would feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they need six more months of</v>

203
00:10:16.081 --> 00:10:17.430
<v Speaker 2>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be sent out.</v>

204
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.930
<v Speaker 2>They would often get disorganized</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were from the inner cities</v>

205
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:25.010
<v Speaker 2>are actually had a mental illness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

206
00:10:25.011 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 2>and this would happen three or four</v>
<v Speaker 2>times until they develop multidrug</v>

207
00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:31.230
<v Speaker 2>resistant tuberculosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in The layman's jargon,</v>

208
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:33.240
<v Speaker 2>a super resistant bug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

209
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.890
<v Speaker 2>and this was frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

210
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:40.500
<v Speaker 2>this situation is now playing out in</v>
<v Speaker 2>places like South Africa where they have</v>

211
00:10:40.501 --> 00:10:43.140
<v Speaker 2>something called an xdr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tuberculosis.</v>

212
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:48.000
<v Speaker 2>and so I know I had many patients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had many,</v>

213
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:52.110
<v Speaker 2>and these epidemics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd have outbursts and in clinics and</v>

214
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:54.210
<v Speaker 2>hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I knew health care providers that</v>

215
00:10:54.211 --> 00:10:57.190
<v Speaker 2>were infected and got sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

216
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.200
<v Speaker 2>sometimes both the patients and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare providers were hiv positive</v>

217
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.460
<v Speaker 2>that seemed to promote actually the</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressiveness of the bacteria</v>

218
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:07.080
<v Speaker 2>progressing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

219
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.280
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in these patients.</v>

220
00:11:08.281 --> 00:11:10.590
<v Speaker 2>So It was quite a frightening situation.</v>

221
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:18.380
<v Speaker 2>One of the good things about</v>
<v Speaker 2>international travel now is that people</v>

222
00:11:18.571 --> 00:11:22.320
<v Speaker 2>are more aware of cultures and</v>
<v Speaker 2>environments because they're traveling</v>

223
00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:25.860
<v Speaker 2>on business to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to emerging markets and frankly,</v>

224
00:11:25.861 --> 00:11:28.290
<v Speaker 2>even some of the less developed</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>

225
00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think they're in general is a,</v>

226
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what globalization has brought as a more</v>

227
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:35.190
<v Speaker 2>awareness of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the inequities,</v>

228
00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:38.640
<v Speaker 2>not just with poverty be with diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

229
00:11:38.641 --> 00:11:39.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

230
00:11:39.271 --> 00:11:44.271
<v Speaker 2>I hope with some of the economic trouble</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the developed world that we don't</v>

231
00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 2>lose sight of the fact that in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>developinG world they are suffering much</v>

232
00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:50.190
<v Speaker 2>worse than we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

233
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.630
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

234
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have an obligation in the develoPed</v>

235
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:54.920
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

236
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 2>to not lose focus on international</v>
<v Speaker 2>development issues.</v>

237
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:05.480
<v Speaker 2>In the seventies when a nixon announced</v>
<v Speaker 2>the war on cancer,</v>

238
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>budgets were decreased for infectious</v>

239
00:12:08.751 --> 00:12:10.340
<v Speaker 2>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this has been well published and</v>

240
00:12:10.341 --> 00:12:12.320
<v Speaker 2>talked about in both the scientific and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

241
00:12:12.321 --> 00:12:14.510
<v Speaker 2>in the lay press.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

242
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.520
<v Speaker 2>and look what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hiv,</v>

243
00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.840
<v Speaker 2>multidRug resistant tuberculosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a west nile virus.</v>

244
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:26.290
<v Speaker 2>I think we've responded now what we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't do is relax our,</v>

245
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.980
<v Speaker 2>a surveillance for emerging diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our laboratory capabilities to study</v>

246
00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:36.410
<v Speaker 2>these organisms and then to scale up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have useful either therapeutics or</v>

247
00:12:36.411 --> 00:12:41.320
<v Speaker 2>vaccines</v>
<v Speaker 2>when sars hit and then people would</v>

248
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.660
<v Speaker 2>probably prefer forgotten about it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was terrifying what,</v>

249
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.140
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a,</v>

250
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.450
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

251
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.570
<v Speaker 2>like an influenza type of illness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

252
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.320
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

253
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.230
<v Speaker 2>the company I work for actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>synthesize 65 compounds in less than a</v>

254
00:12:58.231 --> 00:12:59.011
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

255
00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:01.440
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a very much of a manhattan project</v>

256
00:13:01.441 --> 00:13:03.510
<v Speaker 2>like environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

257
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.160
<v Speaker 2>to then the disease went away</v>
<v Speaker 2>inexplicably.</v>

258
00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think that capability to quickly</v>

259
00:13:10.681 --> 00:13:12.410
<v Speaker 2>respond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

260
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:13.800
<v Speaker 2>and also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

261
00:13:13.801 --> 00:13:16.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a firm believer in science evolving,</v>

262
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in new technologies becoming available.</v>

263
00:13:18.391 --> 00:13:21.960
<v Speaker 2>So when it be nice and actually we are</v>
<v Speaker 2>working on this technology to have a</v>

264
00:13:21.961 --> 00:13:26.961
<v Speaker 2>vaccine response that takes weeks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not nearly a year and in some cases,</v>

265
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there are,</v>

266
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.710
<v Speaker 2>there are approaches and we are working</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that field as well.</v>

267
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's about having existing</v>

268
00:13:34.141 --> 00:13:35.370
<v Speaker 2>capabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

269
00:13:35.371 --> 00:13:38.250
<v Speaker 2>and not relaxed in the guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both on surveillance of new diseases,</v>

270
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.020
<v Speaker 2>but also they built the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>respond.</v>
