1
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.200
<v Speaker 1>As a very famous phrase in the legal</v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

2
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.010
<v Speaker 1>hard cases make bad law and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances that apple and the FBI and</v>

3
00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:19.430
<v Speaker 1>the Justice Department find themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

4
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly not by design,</v>

5
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.670
<v Speaker 1>it's a horrible tragedy that led to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is a wonderful example of a</v>

6
00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:32.861
<v Speaker 1>very hard case you have without question</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who has done an evil,</v>

7
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.790
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderous thing and they have used the</v>

8
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:42.791
<v Speaker 1>device that contains information that</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be not just marginally</v>

9
00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:48.161
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily useful to law</v>
<v Speaker 1>enforcement all over the world,</v>

10
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.540
<v Speaker 1>certainly to the United States in either</v>
<v Speaker 1>solving aspects of this crime or</v>

11
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:56.660
<v Speaker 1>preventing future atrocities from</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurring.</v>

12
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.210
<v Speaker 1>No question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple says that it is not it.</v>

13
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.800
<v Speaker 1>This happens to be an apple device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple has designed their devices so that</v>

14
00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:11.801
<v Speaker 1>people can protect their information and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now a federal judge has ordered apple to</v>

15
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 1>help crack the phone and gain access to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that information.</v>

16
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.080
<v Speaker 1>And apple in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a very interesting letter from its</v>

17
00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:21.200
<v Speaker 1>CEO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Cook has said,</v>

18
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

19
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.120
<v Speaker 1>we are rejecting the judge's order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help crack this.</v>

20
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

21
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Because the problem that emerges is do</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have any expectation or</v>

22
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.530
<v Speaker 1>reasonable expectation of privacy when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use technologies on networks by</v>

23
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.890
<v Speaker 1>exceeding to the judge's request and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>FBI has request a message would be sent</v>

24
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.040
<v Speaker 1>to people all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

25
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America,</v>

26
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.080
<v Speaker 1>the US that if a rule of law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a judge,</v>

27
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Chinese judge Brazilian judge Russian</v>
<v Speaker 1>judge says that thing that you've</v>

28
00:02:06.891 --> 00:02:10.790
<v Speaker 1>encrypted on your device,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want access to it.</v>

29
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.850
<v Speaker 1>It would basically mean you have no</v>
<v Speaker 1>privacy.</v>

30
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.740
<v Speaker 1>If a rule of law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's be very blunt here,</v>

31
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Chinese and Russian rule of law</v>
<v Speaker 1>standards are different than American or</v>

32
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:26.300
<v Speaker 1>British or German.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will have lost standards.</v>

33
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Nobody could count on their devices to</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect them in any other circumstances.</v>

34
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.710
<v Speaker 1>To my mind that is the definition of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard case.</v>

35
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.800
<v Speaker 1>I am extraordinarily sympathetic to</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple.</v>

36
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm extraordinarily sympathetic to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>FBI and the Justice Department.</v>

37
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm even more sympathetic to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>families of the people who were hurt and</v>

38
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:53.270
<v Speaker 1>killed in in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that attack,</v>

39
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:57.440
<v Speaker 1>that terrorist attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is this is one of those</v>

40
00:02:57.441 --> 00:03:02.441
<v Speaker 1>circumstances where there is no good</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer and what ever answer is chosen is</v>

41
00:03:03.351 --> 00:03:03.950
<v Speaker 1>the wrong one.</v>
