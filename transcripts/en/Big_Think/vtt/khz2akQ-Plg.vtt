1
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Well there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no doubt that the whole</v>

2
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:19.011
<v Speaker 1>discussion globally about how to deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the climate crisis is still,</v>

3
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for most people,</v>

4
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.690
<v Speaker 1>the most essential part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

5
00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:30.691
<v Speaker 1>it would be very unfortunate unless we</v>
<v Speaker 1>find ways to deal seriously with the</v>

6
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:35.460
<v Speaker 1>climate crisis and to present it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

7
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

8
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless that happens,</v>

9
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>we certainly are not going to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable development as we look</v>

10
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:48.501
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

11
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically when you look at all the</v>

12
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>elements that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are on the table and in the</v>

13
00:00:55.771 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>discussion even linked up to the climate</v>
<v Speaker 1>change discussion,</v>

14
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.410
<v Speaker 1>all the key issues linked to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable development concept itself</v>

15
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.580
<v Speaker 1>are part of that discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not as if something has been</v>

16
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:19.251
<v Speaker 1>completely lost as we focus on climate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in the whole area of adaptation,</v>

17
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

18
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the sectors that need to be involved</v>

19
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.580
<v Speaker 1>reducing the impact of on our climate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we touched most issues which are</v>

21
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>relevant in a sustainable development</v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

22
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think whether you look at the,</v>

23
00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question of,</v>

24
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way our democracies,</v>

25
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 1>most countries are today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democracies,</v>

26
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.510
<v Speaker 1>although not all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>democracy means public participation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it means at the same time elected</v>

28
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>representatives and a democratic</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions that can help safeguard the</v>

29
00:02:08.621 --> 00:02:13.621
<v Speaker 1>way that people live together and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way we live in relationship with the</v>

30
00:02:14.621 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 1>surrounding world and our environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whether you look at it at national</v>

31
00:02:18.731 --> 00:02:23.731
<v Speaker 1>level or at the global level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is this direct link between public</v>

32
00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:29.221
<v Speaker 1>participation and engagement and the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that leaders who have been elected,</v>

33
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or who are at least in any case,</v>

34
00:02:32.411 --> 00:02:34.780
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the future of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

35
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.990
<v Speaker 1>how they can act together and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.180
<v Speaker 1>have addition and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and method of moving ahead in a</v>

37
00:02:43.181 --> 00:02:45.670
<v Speaker 1>consistent and sustainable manner.</v>

38
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I think it's true to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.650
<v Speaker 1>a lot of politics and the positioning</v>
<v Speaker 1>and different,</v>

40
00:02:56.651 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>national interests and perspectives have</v>

41
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>entered into this global and very key</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

42
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happens in many cases were</v>

43
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:13.651
<v Speaker 1>important issues are at stake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not something I'm only specific</v>

44
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.770
<v Speaker 1>for the climate issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here you have major powers and you</v>

45
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>have major sectors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.020
<v Speaker 1>businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 1>which have been used to having a strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>

48
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.811
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

49
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:33.811
<v Speaker 1>in many countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they all are positioning themselves</v>

50
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:38.270
<v Speaker 1>and pushing for their own interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.320
<v Speaker 1>even short term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is a challenge to people across</v>

52
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:49.621
<v Speaker 1>the world to look beyond this and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge to leaders as we saw happening</v>

53
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>in Copenhagen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

54
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.560
<v Speaker 1>that they have to put their heads</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and feel responsible as a team</v>

55
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 1>across borders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just,</v>

56
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.053
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

57
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicking in their own national</v>

58
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 1>framework.</v>
