00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.070
<v Speaker 1>From a personal standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to think that I'm,</v>

2
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.360
<v Speaker 1>that I am making a contribution and</v>
<v Speaker 1>however big or however small it is,</v>

3
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.710
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm trying to do is to help solve</v>

4
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.010
<v Speaker 1>major social problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to do.</v>

5
00:00:25.011 --> 00:00:26.810
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of my life's work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

6
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.960
<v Speaker 1>And I've worked very hard at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

7
00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I've done it now for a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time and I've worked on everything</v>

8
00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:38.441
<v Speaker 1>from seat belt safety to a third world</v>
<v Speaker 1>development to the things that we do at</v>

9
00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:42.050
<v Speaker 1>arp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a couple of examples of</v>

10
00:00:42.051 --> 00:00:43.580
<v Speaker 1>successes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not me personally,</v>

11
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:44.390
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.290
<v Speaker 1>we've been able to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ARP is that we get prescription drugs</v>

13
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:52.700
<v Speaker 1>into Medicare and you cannot practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern medicine without prescription</v>

14
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:55.490
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So long term that's going to have a huge</v>

15
00:00:55.491 --> 00:00:58.160
<v Speaker 1>payoff for our country and for our older</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens.</v>

16
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few years ago we fought the good fight</v>

17
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:05.840
<v Speaker 1>and we were able to prevent social</v>
<v Speaker 1>security from being privatized.</v>

18
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.560
<v Speaker 1>That for us was a big win and I think a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big win for the country.</v>

19
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.190
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to look at these a,</v>

20
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>and there are plenty of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of losses as well as wins.</v>

21
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to look at these as steps</v>

22
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:19.550
<v Speaker 1>forward and hope that I made a</v>
<v Speaker 1>contribution to</v>

23
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.210
<v Speaker 1>the baby boomers have a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>contribution.</v>

24
00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:30.560
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a book about it.</v>

25
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.100
<v Speaker 1>It's called 50 plus igniting a</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution to reinvent America.</v>

26
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.360
<v Speaker 1>And what 50 plus is about is the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the boomers have so much more to</v>

27
00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:43.060
<v Speaker 1>contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

28
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.100
<v Speaker 1>they're going to leave a legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>

29
00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:49.280
<v Speaker 1>they're making change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in terms of working longer in terms</v>

30
00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:50.114
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening in the marketplace.</v>

32
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the other issues I talked about</v>

33
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.170
<v Speaker 1>in terms of healthcare and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boomers,</v>

34
00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been catered to their whole lives.</v>

35
00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:02.810
<v Speaker 1>They've reinvented every aspect of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've gone through a,</v>

36
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.360
<v Speaker 1>they're going to reinvent retirement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:06.350
<v Speaker 1>and they've got an attitude.</v>

38
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.033
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

39
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest I think is a lack of</v>

40
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.390
<v Speaker 1>political will that we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

41
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Trying to get the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:23.240
<v Speaker 1>the policy changes we need to prepare</v>
<v Speaker 1>for an aging society.</v>

43
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult right now to see how</v>

44
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:31.451
<v Speaker 1>we can break that partisan gridlock that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we face in Washington and in many state</v>

45
00:02:31.581 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 1>capitals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.270
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of it has to be that the public</v>

47
00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:37.790
<v Speaker 1>has to demand change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

48
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:41.870
<v Speaker 1>so that's one of the things that is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tough for us to deal with,</v>

49
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.420
<v Speaker 1>but there are others as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

50
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are in this country</v>

51
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:49.730
<v Speaker 1>because they haven't been able to save</v>
<v Speaker 1>for retirement for whatever reason,</v>

52
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.910
<v Speaker 1>are going to be really dependent upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>social security.</v>

53
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.460
<v Speaker 1>And social security was not ever meant</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be an entire source of retirement</v>

54
00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was meant to be a kind of a safety</v>

55
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>net kind of a floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm helping people who need a</v>

56
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>helping hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helping older people,</v>

57
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are not going to be well off as many</v>

58
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 1>boomers are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a key part of what we have to think</v>

59
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:12.604
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

60
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.020
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
