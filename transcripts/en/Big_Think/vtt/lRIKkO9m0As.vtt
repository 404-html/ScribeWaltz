1
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>What we mean by valuing our elderly has</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably changed a lot over time.</v>

2
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>In traditional societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look to our elderly as the</v>

3
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>repositories of our society's history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tradition and it's knowledge.</v>

4
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.150
<v Speaker 1>They were our computer memory banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were the ones who had experienced</v>

5
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>and understood all of society's</v>
<v Speaker 1>intricacies.</v>

6
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>As time went on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elderly were less and less important</v>

7
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>for that purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so books first became available and in</v>

8
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>books you could write down a scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>

9
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 1>traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>society's history,</v>

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.290
<v Speaker 1>and you didn't need the memory of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>elderly as much to remind you of those</v>

11
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course when we get to the modern</v>

12
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we seem not to need the elderly for that</v>

13
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have enormous repositories of</v>

14
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.700
<v Speaker 1>information in computers and books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we ask ourselves,</v>

15
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to value the elderly</v>
<v Speaker 1>today?</v>

16
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.340
<v Speaker 1>And aside from the simple important of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the of elderly being human beings who</v>

17
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>have wants and needs and desires and</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings that we as other human beings</v>

18
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>need to respect and help nurture.</v>

19
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>And aside from the fact that when we say</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elderly,</v>

20
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>we're really talking about our parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>and grandparents and our love for them,</v>

21
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.490
<v Speaker 1>the social question of their function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that would mean the society may</v>

22
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>have changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my suggestion is that though the</v>

23
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:47.481
<v Speaker 1>elderly may have lost their traditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>role as the repositories of knowledge,</v>

24
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.800
<v Speaker 1>they still have their traditional role</v>
<v Speaker 1>as fonts of wisdom,</v>

25
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.090
<v Speaker 1>their experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lived experience of,</v>

26
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>of the decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

27
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.750
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a great events and social</v>
<v Speaker 1>moments,</v>

28
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that proceeded.</v>

29
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>The birth of the people who could</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit by them are extraordinarily</v>

30
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:18.261
<v Speaker 1>important for us to respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because out of that experience comes a</v>

31
00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:23.991
<v Speaker 1>perspective that youth doesn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so my suggestion is we need to value</v>

32
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>our elderly for the wisdom that they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>give us to guide us through some of the</v>

33
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>really important decisions that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make in modern society.</v>

34
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Just because my mother or grandmother</v>
<v Speaker 1>May need some help operating her</v>

35
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:48.981
<v Speaker 1>computer does not mean that she doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a deeper understanding of how</v>

36
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.720
<v Speaker 1>sitting in front of a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how interacting with others through a</v>

37
00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:59.721
<v Speaker 1>computer screen</v>
<v Speaker 1>may not be the productive way to,</v>

38
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop oneself as a human being.</v>

39
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.230
<v Speaker 1>We can draw from our elderly enormous</v>
<v Speaker 1>value through depending on them as a</v>

40
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>check and a balance against the excesses</v>
<v Speaker 1>of youth.</v>

41
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.440
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 1>that's how we value our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how we should value our elderly.</v>

43
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've changed remarkably in recent times</v>

44
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 1>in our willingness to cater to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>elderly.</v>

45
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 1>We have retirement communities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>activities that we never had before.</v>

46
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.880
<v Speaker 1>But with that tends to do often is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolate them from interactions with the</v>

47
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>younger generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in are incredibly mobile</v>

48
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think as a society we do need</v>

49
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:53.491
<v Speaker 1>to make an effort to mix the general</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation's a little more so that the</v>

50
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 1>younger generations can benefit from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom of their elders</v>

51
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 1>in bioethics.</v>

52
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.020
<v Speaker 1>The term dignity is bandied about a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>without people really thinking deeply</v>

53
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.470
<v Speaker 1>about what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

54
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Historically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a French medieval scholar and historian</v>

55
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>named Felipe Irys wrote a book about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stages of death throughout history.</v>

56
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.730
<v Speaker 1>A tamed death is what he called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first stage in ancient times when people</v>

57
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 1>expected death to come and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporated into the society.</v>

58
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Then there was a stage called my own</v>
<v Speaker 1>death when people discovered selfhood in</v>

59
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:38.590
<v Speaker 1>a sense historically individuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for the first time we see grave</v>

60
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:43.591
<v Speaker 1>markers with individuals' names on them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there were other phases to the last</v>

61
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 1>phase before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one we're in now was called hidden</v>

62
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>death where we put death in hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we closed the curtain and death was</v>

63
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>hidden away from society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stage I think we're in now,</v>

64
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:56.020
<v Speaker 1>I call controlled death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>

65
00:04:56.021 --> 00:05:00.280
<v Speaker 1>our goal is to decide how we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>die when we're gonna die under what</v>

66
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 1>circumstances in some cases even</v>
<v Speaker 1>initiating our own death through</v>

67
00:05:04.691 --> 00:05:06.970
<v Speaker 1>physician assisted suicide or</v>
<v Speaker 1>euthanasia.</v>

68
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>So what we mean by a dignified death has</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed over time.</v>

69
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 1>And today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we tend to mean by it is a death</v>

70
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:19.660
<v Speaker 1>that I control in my own way where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>not stuck in a hospital bed with needles</v>

71
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:23.140
<v Speaker 1>and tubes going into me under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>control of someone else.</v>

72
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Is that really what we want a dignified</v>
<v Speaker 1>death to be?</v>

73
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 1>That is what society is deciding right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

74
00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 1>That's what the debate about physician</v>
<v Speaker 1>assisted suicide are about right now.</v>

75
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean to have a dignified</v>
<v Speaker 1>death?</v>

76
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean just a death where others</v>
<v Speaker 1>treat you with deference or does it mean</v>

77
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:46.030
<v Speaker 1>to death where you get to decide the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

78
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.670
<v Speaker 1>timing and circumstances of your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>death?</v>

79
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Researchers are making enormous strides</v>
<v Speaker 1>and brain computer interfaces and there</v>

80
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:03.650
<v Speaker 1>are two major kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is called augmented cognition,</v>

81
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>and that involves</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating computers that can actually</v>

82
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 1>interact with human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have very limited memories.</v>

83
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:17.471
<v Speaker 1>Attention desertion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we try to make decisions when we're</v>

84
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 1>piloting a plane or when we're working</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a complex task,</v>

85
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.930
<v Speaker 1>our brains can only incorporate finite</v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts of information.</v>

86
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.430
<v Speaker 1>The idea of augmented cognition is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement that for a computer to be</v>

87
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:36.431
<v Speaker 1>able to see how a human being is acting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then reacting to that human being's</v>

88
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 1>needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think there's a major issue</v>

89
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:44.801
<v Speaker 1>with augmented cognition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the second piece of BCIS or brain</v>

90
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:50.660
<v Speaker 1>computer interfaces is what we call</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroprosthetics and that involves</v>

91
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:54.080
<v Speaker 1>actually using computers to supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

92
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:59.140
<v Speaker 1>damage into the function of the brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were actually talking about in</v>

93
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 1>many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>implanting computer chips into the brain</v>

94
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.060
<v Speaker 1>or creating an interface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a physical hard wired interface between</v>

95
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:11.960
<v Speaker 1>the brain and a computer through</v>
<v Speaker 1>implanting electrodes that are connected</v>

96
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:16.961
<v Speaker 1>to a computer and that can be used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help paraplegic and paraplegics and</v>

97
00:07:17.031 --> 00:07:19.160
<v Speaker 1>quadriplegics and manipulate their</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

98
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 1>It can be used for or they hope it will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to be used for people who have</v>

99
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.720
<v Speaker 1>lesions or tumors in the brain that</v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupt function.</v>

100
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Then we're talking about for the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time in history,</v>

101
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.380
<v Speaker 1>having brains and information technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>working together in an integrated way.</v>

102
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:41.810
<v Speaker 1>The good news about that is that brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>plasticity allows that and we may find</v>

103
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:45.560
<v Speaker 1>that these neural prosthetics helped</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in profound ways.</v>

104
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.230
<v Speaker 1>An example of that would be cochlear</v>
<v Speaker 1>implants.</v>

105
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.400
<v Speaker 1>The problem is once you begin to</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement the natural function of our</v>

106
00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:58.890
<v Speaker 1>brains with artificially created</v>
<v Speaker 1>information technologies,</v>

107
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.700
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're risking a whole host of problems</v>

108
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:06.970
<v Speaker 1>from competition between the two forms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of information to malfunction of the</v>

109
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:13.220
<v Speaker 1>information technology to kind of deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological,</v>

110
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulty in understanding that my own</v>

111
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:23.270
<v Speaker 1>thought processes are no longer only</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine,</v>

112
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.520
<v Speaker 1>but involve some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of silicon chip that has now been fully</v>

113
00:08:28.521 --> 00:08:32.360
<v Speaker 1>integrated into me because after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike genetics,</v>

114
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:34.730
<v Speaker 1>even though we spend a lot of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about that,</v>

115
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.240
<v Speaker 1>we think of our brains as uniquely us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My identical twin can share my genetics,</v>

116
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.890
<v Speaker 1>but my brain is mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when we,</v>

117
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.970
<v Speaker 1>when we begin to manipulate the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's through bcis or</v>

118
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.920
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceuticals or in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are beginning to alter in some sense</v>

119
00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:55.160
<v Speaker 1>that which we think of as most uniquely</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

120
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.570
<v Speaker 1>And we have to do it with great caution.</v>

121
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Brain imaging research is advancing at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>startling pace for a long time.</v>

122
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I kept predicting that this research was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to hit a wall and stop and it</v>

123
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:12.930
<v Speaker 1>hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've stopped thinking that there's a</v>

124
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:17.750
<v Speaker 1>natural boundary to this research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they are doing now is</v>

125
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.820
<v Speaker 1>having people think of objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

126
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:27.910
<v Speaker 1>intentions and and other normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>functions of the brain and through brain</v>

127
00:09:28.311 --> 00:09:31.250
<v Speaker 1>imaging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are able to predict what that</v>

128
00:09:31.251 --> 00:09:34.430
<v Speaker 1>person is thinking of what sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>with startling accuracy,</v>

129
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.020
<v Speaker 1>certainly if you have someone think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>one object rather than another,</v>

130
00:09:39.021 --> 00:09:42.560
<v Speaker 1>a hammer or a chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brain imaging can now after getting a</v>

131
00:09:42.561 --> 00:09:47.210
<v Speaker 1>baseline predict with great accuracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>which one you're thinking of.</v>

132
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:52.690
<v Speaker 1>There's research that showed a out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Berlin that if you asked someone to add</v>

133
00:09:52.731 --> 00:09:55.730
<v Speaker 1>or subtract two numbers together and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain image them,</v>

134
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:59.270
<v Speaker 1>walk once they've decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before they've revealed it to you,</v>

135
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.080
<v Speaker 1>you can predict with great accuracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>which one they have done,</v>

136
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.680
<v Speaker 1>which one they've decided to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we have now is the possibility</v>

137
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:15.910
<v Speaker 1>that brain imaging will at some point be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to actually get fairly detailed and</v>

138
00:10:16.221 --> 00:10:17.054
<v Speaker 1>robust</v>

139
00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:24.220
<v Speaker 1>the predictions or recognitions of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person is thinking of.</v>

140
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has profound implications for</v>

141
00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.220
<v Speaker 1>forensics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Courtrooms would love this kind of</v>

142
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:34.690
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are working very hard on a brain</v>

143
00:10:34.691 --> 00:10:39.610
<v Speaker 1>imaging lie detector and there are now</v>
<v Speaker 1>two companies that actually offer brain</v>

144
00:10:39.611 --> 00:10:43.020
<v Speaker 1>imaging lie detection to the public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

145
00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 1>the question of putting someone in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scanner to try to determine guilt or</v>

146
00:10:49.361 --> 00:10:52.960
<v Speaker 1>innocence or to try to decide if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were at the scene of a crime.</v>

147
00:10:52.961 --> 00:10:56.560
<v Speaker 1>They are also using eeg besides brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>imaging for that,</v>

148
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has become a very controversial issue in</v>

149
00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.820
<v Speaker 1>illegal channels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that there really is</v>

150
00:11:03.821 --> 00:11:07.300
<v Speaker 1>any consensus about how this can and</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be used.</v>

151
00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.390
<v Speaker 1>But even outside of the courtroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some very interesting</v>

152
00:11:10.391 --> 00:11:13.450
<v Speaker 1>implications of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have two teenage daughters.</v>

153
00:11:13.451 --> 00:11:16.810
<v Speaker 1>If I come home one day and my car is</v>
<v Speaker 1>dented and both of them said they didn't</v>

154
00:11:16.811 --> 00:11:20.440
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will I be able to drag them off to a one</v>

155
00:11:20.441 --> 00:11:22.690
<v Speaker 1>of these new lie detection companies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

156
00:11:22.691 --> 00:11:23.650
<v Speaker 1>get in the scanner.</v>

157
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.540
<v Speaker 1>I want to know which one of you dented</v>
<v Speaker 1>the car.</v>

158
00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Would schools be able to use that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug searches?</v>

159
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Will companies be able to use that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all saw minority report when Tom</v>

160
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Cruise walks into the store and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>scanners in the store and know who he</v>

161
00:11:37.061 --> 00:11:38.200
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he likes to buy,</v>

162
00:11:38.201 --> 00:11:39.880
<v Speaker 1>what he bought the last time he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

163
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:45.300
<v Speaker 1>There really is a a privacy issue here</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we as a society are going to have</v>

164
00:11:46.061 --> 00:11:50.590
<v Speaker 1>to make a decision about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One quick example that I think will</v>

165
00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 1>illustrate how different this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similar issues that came before.</v>

166
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 1>According to our constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a right against self</v>

167
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:03.010
<v Speaker 1>incrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that means legally though is not I</v>

168
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.060
<v Speaker 1>have a right to deny you my DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a court orders it or,</v>

169
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.230
<v Speaker 1>or a hair sample,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the court can take those from me even</v>

170
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 1>though they may incriminate me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the constitution gives us a right</v>

171
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.730
<v Speaker 1>against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

172
00:12:16.731 --> 00:12:20.830
<v Speaker 1>the fifth amendment actually against</v>
<v Speaker 1>testimonial self-incrimination.</v>

173
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.440
<v Speaker 1>You can't force me to testify against</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

174
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.830
<v Speaker 1>which includes pointing at something</v>
<v Speaker 1>gesturing.</v>

175
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Any action that I do that involves</v>
<v Speaker 1>revealing my thought to you is</v>

176
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:33.820
<v Speaker 1>considered testimonial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

177
00:12:33.821 --> 00:12:38.290
<v Speaker 1>what if you could read my brain and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece of evidence that could be used</v>

178
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:41.440
<v Speaker 1>against me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that testimonial evidence?</v>

179
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't testified.</v>

180
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Or is that more like blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>semen,</v>

181
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.640
<v Speaker 1>DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they can take from me even though</v>

182
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't want them to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is it's not like either of</v>

183
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:55.270
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a new ability that we have as human</v>

184
00:12:55.271 --> 00:12:58.180
<v Speaker 1>beings and at some point the courts are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to decide,</v>

185
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.600
<v Speaker 1>is brain imaging of protected a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>testimonial evidence or is it a picture</v>

186
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:12.541
<v Speaker 1>on a scanner that should be considered</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way we consider other physical</v>

187
00:13:13.541 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 1>evidence that I don't have a right to</v>
<v Speaker 1>withhold.</v>

188
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:20.820
<v Speaker 1>That's one example of the thorny kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of questions that this technology is</v>

189
00:13:21.071 --> 00:13:21.904
<v Speaker 1>going to bring.</v>

190
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 1>The stem cell debate has been a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating debate in our society for a</v>

191
00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:31.660
<v Speaker 1>number of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

192
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.490
<v Speaker 1>we always thought that the abortion</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate was pretty set.</v>

193
00:13:36.491 --> 00:13:40.120
<v Speaker 1>There was a group pro choice group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro life,</v>

194
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:45.450
<v Speaker 1>and it was very easy to determine which</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups were in which camp.</v>

195
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Then stem cells came along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are really based on the same moral</v>

196
00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:55.780
<v Speaker 1>objection that an embryo should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>treated as a human being and that human</v>

197
00:13:55.781 --> 00:14:00.220
<v Speaker 1>being should not be destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you saw for the first time was</v>

198
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.190
<v Speaker 1>people crossing camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you had a number of,</v>

199
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.140
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people in Congress,</v>

200
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Orrin Hatch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Strom Thurmond and others who are</v>

201
00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:12.661
<v Speaker 1>very strongly in the anti abortion camp</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were also very strongly in the pro</v>

202
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.010
<v Speaker 1>stem cell camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

203
00:14:15.011 --> 00:14:20.011
<v Speaker 1>you had some religious groups that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>against abortion when the fetus was in a</v>

204
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:26.491
<v Speaker 1>woman's uterus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But who said a cell in a dish is not the</v>

205
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:27.934
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

206
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
<v Speaker 1>So you had important a schisms there in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this endless abortion debate that we've</v>

207
00:14:34.661 --> 00:14:38.320
<v Speaker 1>been having for over 30 years in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

208
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.520
<v Speaker 1>and that is actually a hopeful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows that perhaps by breaking</v>

209
00:14:42.521 --> 00:14:44.800
<v Speaker 1>through some of those traditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>barriers,</v>

210
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:49.000
<v Speaker 1>we can begin to talk more about</v>
<v Speaker 1>compromise not only on stem cells,</v>

211
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 1>but also on abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

212
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:56.690
<v Speaker 1>the bottom line on the stem cell debate</v>
<v Speaker 1>is unlike the abortion debate,</v>

213
00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:01.740
<v Speaker 1>it is going to go away and it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go away because science is in the</v>

214
00:15:01.761 --> 00:15:04.130
<v Speaker 1>process of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's some successes in this</v>

215
00:15:04.131 --> 00:15:08.670
<v Speaker 1>already being able to create stem cells</v>
<v Speaker 1>without having destroy,</v>

216
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 1>destroy the embryos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since the destruction of the embryos</v>

217
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:15.520
<v Speaker 1>was really the only objection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

218
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.200
<v Speaker 1>against stem cell research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one science masters,</v>

219
00:15:18.201 --> 00:15:23.201
<v Speaker 1>the ability to create stem cells that do</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything embryonic stem cells do</v>

220
00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:25.500
<v Speaker 1>without destroying embryos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

221
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:30.410
<v Speaker 1>the debate that debate will go away</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that science achieves that</v>

222
00:15:30.411 --> 00:15:32.540
<v Speaker 1>they're very close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't quite gotten there yet.</v>

223
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Ethics involved scholars from across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual spectrum,</v>

224
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:44.480
<v Speaker 1>so philosophers and social scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in bioethics you have</v>

225
00:15:44.481 --> 00:15:47.480
<v Speaker 1>clinicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have lawyers and nurses,</v>

226
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:50.810
<v Speaker 1>and you've got economists and you've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>political activists.</v>

227
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Ethics involves people who approach it</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a scholarly perspective,</v>

228
00:15:57.141 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 1>those who approach project from a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of pragmatic,</v>

229
00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:02.850
<v Speaker 1>social perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what ethics really is,</v>

230
00:16:02.851 --> 00:16:07.851
<v Speaker 1>is a conversation and to point to a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are somehow innovative and</v>

231
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:13.220
<v Speaker 1>ethics is to ask the question of what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovative in our society that has</v>

232
00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:15.860
<v Speaker 1>ethical implications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

233
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:21.310
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of ethical discussion</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now about the proper use of the</v>

234
00:16:21.771 --> 00:16:23.510
<v Speaker 1>web,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

235
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.670
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other kinds of information</v>

236
00:16:25.671 --> 00:16:30.671
<v Speaker 1>technologies and the question of whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should be government control.</v>

237
00:16:31.001 --> 00:16:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Should there be regulation there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should it be controlled by the people.</v>

238
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.830
<v Speaker 1>There are ethical questions around our</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>

239
00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big one we're dealing with as we</v>

240
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.020
<v Speaker 1>tape this is healthcare reform.</v>

241
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:46.910
<v Speaker 1>And there are some very innovative kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of suggestions that have been made by</v>

242
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:51.620
<v Speaker 1>ethicists and others about how we might</v>
<v Speaker 1>get around the roadblocks of healthcare</v>

243
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.210
<v Speaker 1>reform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

244
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president's bioethics commissions,</v>

245
00:16:55.941 --> 00:16:59.960
<v Speaker 1>both President Clinton and president</v>
<v Speaker 1>bushes have worked hard on these kinds</v>

246
00:16:59.961 --> 00:17:03.530
<v Speaker 1>of issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that interests me of</v>

247
00:17:03.531 --> 00:17:06.620
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is biotechnologies and there we have</v>

248
00:17:06.621 --> 00:17:11.570
<v Speaker 1>some fascinating issues and questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how we are going to change</v>

249
00:17:11.571 --> 00:17:15.170
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A human enhancement has become a very</v>

250
00:17:15.171 --> 00:17:20.171
<v Speaker 1>big</v>
<v Speaker 1>question for those of us thinking about</v>

251
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.280
<v Speaker 1>how is technology going to alter the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of being human,</v>

252
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.680
<v Speaker 1>what it's going to mean for our</v>
<v Speaker 1>abilities?</v>

253
00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.580
<v Speaker 1>How are our children as they go through</v>
<v Speaker 1>school best,</v>

254
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:32.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

255
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:39.100
<v Speaker 1>considered with attention enhancing</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs available now with memory</v>

256
00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:44.180
<v Speaker 1>enhancing drugs coming out soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a boon to our children or is it</v>

257
00:17:44.181 --> 00:17:49.181
<v Speaker 1>somehow diminishing their developmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>capabilities to give them drugs that</v>

258
00:17:49.591 --> 00:17:51.630
<v Speaker 1>will enhance their capabilities in</v>
<v Speaker 1>school?</v>

259
00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we now have abilities to predict the</v>

260
00:17:57.031 --> 00:17:58.140
<v Speaker 1>onset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

261
00:17:58.141 --> 00:18:00.210
<v Speaker 1>of mental illness in ways we haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

262
00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:05.211
<v Speaker 1>Some work being done here at emory has</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggested that even in children as young</v>

263
00:18:05.521 --> 00:18:10.350
<v Speaker 1>as elementary school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might be able to see some beginning</v>

264
00:18:10.351 --> 00:18:13.230
<v Speaker 1>signs of susceptibility to</v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia.</v>

265
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.260
<v Speaker 1>And then the big ethical question is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we do about it?</v>

266
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Do we give them a kind of prophylactic</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric medication?</v>

267
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:25.770
<v Speaker 1>All the medications for schizophrenia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While they are very important for people</v>

268
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:30.060
<v Speaker 1>who have it are not nice medications and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to give them to children,</v>

269
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.990
<v Speaker 1>especially without being able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this child will definitely become</v>

270
00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:38.580
<v Speaker 1>mentally ill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what we have now is an explosion in</v>

271
00:18:38.581 --> 00:18:42.390
<v Speaker 1>biotechnology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are able to manipulate the plasms and</v>

272
00:18:42.391 --> 00:18:46.380
<v Speaker 1>the functions of the body in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a few years ago,</v>

273
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:51.000
<v Speaker 1>we're almost inconceivable and we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ask ourselves,</v>

274
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.720
<v Speaker 1>should we do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How should we do it and under what</v>

275
00:18:54.721 --> 00:18:56.850
<v Speaker 1>circumstances?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that by the way,</v>

276
00:18:56.851 --> 00:19:01.470
<v Speaker 1>is where the question of wisdom versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge actually comes in because the</v>

277
00:19:01.471 --> 00:19:05.400
<v Speaker 1>answers to these questions don't involve</v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering more facts.</v>

278
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:10.650
<v Speaker 1>They involve thinking deeply about those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are of most importance to us</v>

279
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:15.950
<v Speaker 1>and deciding how we can sustain and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain those things even as we use</v>

280
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:18.750
<v Speaker 1>biotechnology for its best purpose.</v>
