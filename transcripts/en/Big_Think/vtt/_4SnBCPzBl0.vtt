1
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.280
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a lot about the ethics of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they treat non human animals.</v>

2
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.640
<v Speaker 1>I say non human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of course we are.</v>

3
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Animals were not plowed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I thought fun guy went up.</v>

4
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all,</v>

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.030
<v Speaker 1>we all animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>there is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a double standard,</v>

7
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our ethics of precedent,</v>

8
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.073
<v Speaker 1>which place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which builds a wall around our own </v>

9
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:30.120
<v Speaker 1>species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Homo Sapiens,</v>

10
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.763
<v Speaker 1>which is rather odd evolutionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you could think about the fact that </v>

11
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:34.524
<v Speaker 1>we are close cousins of chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think about the fact that we are </v>

12
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:39.054
<v Speaker 1>descended from a common ancestor that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived only about six or 7 million years </v>

13
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to erect a moral wall around</v>

14
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.420
<v Speaker 1>our species and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

15
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:49.254
<v Speaker 1>that a human embryo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a very beginning human embryo a </v>

16
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.083
<v Speaker 1>long before it develops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nervous system is somehow worthy of </v>

17
00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>moral consideration than an adult </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee.</v>

18
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Then that is a rather evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint.</v>

19
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>If you look back in our ancestry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what point would you draw the line?</v>

20
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:09.594
<v Speaker 1>Would you give?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there were Australopithecus answer's </v>

21
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>almost certainly our ancestor </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australopithecus of 3 million years ago.</v>

22
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.393
<v Speaker 1>If you were to meet what if wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>survived in the African jungle when you </v>

23
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>give it the same moral consideration as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the rest of us,</v>

24
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:26.721
<v Speaker 1>or would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

25
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:27.554
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what has the same moral </v>

26
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:32.840
<v Speaker 1>consideration as a chimpanzee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

27
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.610
<v Speaker 1>if we look back in history a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries ago,</v>

28
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>most people accepted slavery and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.840
<v Speaker 1>nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course that's a horrifying thought.</v>

30
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.750
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>

31
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>No civilized person today except </v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery.</v>

32
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.020
<v Speaker 1>And if you look back further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>

33
00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>we had the appalling things that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romans were doing in the coliseum with,</v>

34
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.440
<v Speaker 1>with spectator sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching people killing other people,</v>

35
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.283
<v Speaker 1>lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing people regarding it as fun </v>

36
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.610
<v Speaker 1>entertainment to take the children not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

37
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>We're certainly getting better as steven</v>
<v Speaker 1>pinker has said in his book,</v>

38
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.943
<v Speaker 1>the better angels of our nature and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Shermer has in his book on the </v>

39
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:16.160
<v Speaker 1>moral Argh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

40
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>so we're changing a lot and it's there </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sort of fairly obvious thing to do,</v>

41
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:21.714
<v Speaker 1>to look into the future and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will our future descendants think </v>

42
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.780
<v Speaker 1>when they look back at us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way we look back at our slave owning</v>

43
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>ancestors with horror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will our descendants will look back</v>

44
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.963
<v Speaker 1>on it in our time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the obvious candidate would </v>

45
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>be the way we treat non human animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

46
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>my view would be that we want to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

47
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the criterion would be,</v>

48
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.280
<v Speaker 1>can this creature suffer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the criteria.</v>

49
00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 1>And that Jeremy Bentham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great moral philosopher laid out,</v>

50
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin,</v>

51
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.863
<v Speaker 1>can they suffer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's every reason to think that </v>

52
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least,</v>

53
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably many more cans,</v>

54
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.760
<v Speaker 1>can suffer perhaps as much as we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>

55
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Think about what pain is for </v>
<v Speaker 1>biologically speaking.</v>

56
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Pain is a warning to the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't do that.</v>

57
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:17.734
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the animal does something which is </v>

58
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:23.881
<v Speaker 1>which results in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a kind of ritual death.</v>

59
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>It's telling the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do that again,</v>

60
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>you might die and you might fail to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduce.</v>

61
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 1>That's why not for selection has built </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain into our nervous system,</v>

62
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:36.600
<v Speaker 1>was built the capacity to feel pain into</v>
<v Speaker 1>our nervous system.</v>

63
00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:41.601
<v Speaker 1>So don't mess around with a whole nuts </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's painful.</v>

64
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.253
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't pick up burning coals from the </v>

65
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that again.</v>

66
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 1>There's absolutely no reason as far as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can see why a nonhuman animal,</v>

67
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.800
<v Speaker 1>a dog or a chimpanzee or a cow should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>any less capable of feeling pain than we</v>

68
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:00.124
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think of what pain is actually </v>

69
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.003
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain feels like something primitive </v>

70
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:05.854
<v Speaker 1>feels like something like seeing color </v>
<v Speaker 1>or smelling a rose or something like </v>

71
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:11.200
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

72
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.033
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel like the kind of thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>for which you need intellect and </v>

73
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 1>actually you can go even further than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

74
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since pain is there to warn the animal,</v>

75
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>not to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

76
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.743
<v Speaker 1>an animal which is a slow learner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal which is not particularly </v>

77
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might actually need more intense pain in</v>

78
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>order to deter it from doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

79
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
<v Speaker 1>then a human who is intelligent enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn quickly not to do that again,</v>

80
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:46.510
<v Speaker 1>so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's even possible that nonhuman animals</v>

81
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.600
<v Speaker 1>are capable of feeling more intense pain</v>
<v Speaker 1>than we are.</v>

82
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how far I want to push that</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>

83
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:55.504
<v Speaker 1>but I think at least I can say this </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely no reason to suppose that </v>

84
00:04:57.911 --> 00:04:58.744
<v Speaker 1>they feel less pain than we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we should give them the benefit of </v>

85
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:02.584
<v Speaker 1>the doubt.</v>
