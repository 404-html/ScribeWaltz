1
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.910
<v Speaker 1>I love thinking about leveraging the</v>
<v Speaker 1>laws of likability when giving feedback,</v>

2
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.450
<v Speaker 1>because feedback is only effective if</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody can receive it,</v>

3
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.340
<v Speaker 1>so you want to present feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say on a silver platter and not on a</v>

4
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>garbage can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lid,</v>

5
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to remember it's not about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication style,</v>

6
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>it's about there's the best way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop your people is to flex to them,</v>

7
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.120
<v Speaker 1>to empower them to adapt your style to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they need.</v>

8
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a leader,</v>

9
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.820
<v Speaker 1>that's a coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if there's somebody who really likes</v>

10
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:36.500
<v Speaker 1>direct feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's something you're not</v>

11
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will respect and be able to take it</v>

12
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:41.630
<v Speaker 1>in better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can just get to the point,</v>

13
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.120
<v Speaker 1>if you're somebody who's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>directing,</v>

14
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.090
<v Speaker 1>they need a little bit more tact and</v>
<v Speaker 1>diplomacy,</v>

15
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.720
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to need to massage</v>
<v Speaker 1>your messaging.</v>

16
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.850
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be heard.</v>

17
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.410
<v Speaker 1>There's a correlation between the speed</v>
<v Speaker 1>at which somebody receives that feedback</v>

18
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 1>and the importance that they place on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

19
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.190
<v Speaker 1>When you delay feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you delayed the value you're placing on</v>

20
00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:07.100
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So immediacy is important.</v>

21
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in the exact moment.</v>

22
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Let them have a moment to breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't wait more than a day if you</v>

23
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:16.130
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's really crucial you had that</v>

24
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:19.670
<v Speaker 1>weekly meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it will fade from your memory.</v>

25
00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:22.550
<v Speaker 1>By that point it becomes less important</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you and to them,</v>

26
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.710
<v Speaker 1>so make sure you give that feedback</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly and specifically,</v>

27
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.570
<v Speaker 1>don't just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

28
00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:33.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it went well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell them why you thought it went well,</v>

29
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.050
<v Speaker 1>what specifically they did that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought went well,</v>

30
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.150
<v Speaker 1>and then challenge them with the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>

31
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Give them something to keep growing</v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

32
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.550
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>law of likability,</v>

33
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.930
<v Speaker 1>it's law of curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have a model that you can walk</v>

34
00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:52.220
<v Speaker 1>through any challenging or feedback</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation that will leverage these</v>

35
00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:53.120
<v Speaker 1>laws of likability.</v>

36
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Starting with curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity creates connections and</v>

37
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.800
<v Speaker 1>connection is important in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations because when you receiving</v>

38
00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:03.020
<v Speaker 1>feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're considering your source and when</v>

39
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:05.870
<v Speaker 1>you don't value trust or like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>source,</v>

40
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.810
<v Speaker 1>then you might not be really willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take that information in.</v>

41
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.220
<v Speaker 1>So the model is four parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ask,</v>

42
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 1>elaborate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>empower.</v>

43
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Collaborate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ask is going to leverage that law of</v>

44
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:21.230
<v Speaker 1>curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start with a question and make sure that</v>

45
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.840
<v Speaker 1>question is open ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

46
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that went well,</v>

47
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 1>which is implying that you don't think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that went well.</v>

48
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Instead you asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you think it went?</v>

49
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.790
<v Speaker 1>What do you think went well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think could've gone better</v>

50
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.080
<v Speaker 1>and get them talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the key to opening up a feedback</v>

51
00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:44.360
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's get the information from them.</v>

52
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.800
<v Speaker 1>It actually makes it easier on you as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>manager because you see where they're</v>

53
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:49.280
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they already know.</v>

54
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.890
<v Speaker 1>They're bringing information in the room</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can determine,</v>

55
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.810
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're about on the same page,</v>

56
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.970
<v Speaker 1>or we have completely different views of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation and that will help kind</v>

57
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 1>tweak the information that you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring into the room.</v>

58
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes people are much harder on</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves than you'll ever be on them.</v>

59
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>The next love likability is the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing.</v>

60
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 1>You have to listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so listen for the understanding,</v>

61
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>listened for the concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listened for a different view,</v>

62
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we know we're coming in with a</v>

63
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>belief about what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to try to check that assumption</v>

64
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>at the door and listen for other</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities,</v>

65
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>other narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

66
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>so we've asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've listened.</v>

67
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Now it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the manager ask,</v>

68
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 1>elaborate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is your chance to add information</v>

69
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>that you might've heard collected from</v>
<v Speaker 1>other sources.</v>

70
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Be additive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't say,</v>

71
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard.</v>

72
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Instead you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>additionally,</v>

73
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>I received information from so and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this and that,</v>

74
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 1>and you're bringing in that information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my perspective of,</v>

75
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>and it could be elevating them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feedback isn't always negative.</v>

76
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to brace them and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to brace yourself.</v>

77
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Feedback is simply information and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>information that you want to make</v>

78
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 1>somebody able to use and put into</v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

79
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 1>So that is the first half of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

80
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Before you move onto the second half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I want you to think about our root</v>

81
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:16.630
<v Speaker 1>causes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the root causes and the reasons</v>

82
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.240
<v Speaker 1>that it went so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the root causes and the reasons</v>

83
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 1>that it didn't go so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there something that's underlying</v>

84
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 1>that can help us in the second half of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this conversation,</v>

85
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>what we're looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the solutions?</v>

86
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Did you not have training?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you not have authority?</v>

87
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Did you not have budget?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

88
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Let's evaluate that before we move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're going to throw back to the</v>

89
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 1>other person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to empower them,</v>

90
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.790
<v Speaker 1>get them to throw the ideas out of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think the next step should be,</v>

91
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.970
<v Speaker 1>so what would you do differently next</v>
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>

92
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Or how do you think we can move forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>from here are great questions to start</v>

93
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>the empower phase</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we empower them and bring those</v>

94
00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be very careful at that last</v>

95
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 1>stage of the conversation where you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>collaborating because as the manager,</v>

96
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:05.680
<v Speaker 1>as the leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you put your idea out there,</v>

97
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to defer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so builds off of their ideas.</v>

98
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in addition,</v>

99
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>you could also do this or maybe even</v>
<v Speaker 1>switched the order.</v>

100
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The collaboration isn't a dictation.</v>

101
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>The collaboration is the exchange.</v>

102
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another key thing that can happen in</v>

103
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:28.000
<v Speaker 1>that last phase of the feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when things might not have</v>

104
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:31.600
<v Speaker 1>gone the way that you wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to leverage the law of similarity</v>

105
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.980
<v Speaker 1>by sharing experience that you went</v>
<v Speaker 1>through that might be similar to what</v>

106
00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:38.740
<v Speaker 1>they're experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You create a teachable moment.</v>

107
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 1>You build trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're vulnerable with your</v>

108
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 1>employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually increase your credibility,</v>

109
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.950
<v Speaker 1>so remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability is not about weakness.</v>

110
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 1>It's about openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so share the story of how when things</v>

111
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>didn't go so well for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you did,</v>

112
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>what you learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it went,</v>

113
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>and let them know it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all make mistakes and we can still</v>

114
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:05.510
<v Speaker 1>get to the positions that you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the last thing to remember is the</v>

115
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 1>law of likability called mood memory</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if they walk away from that</v>

116
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:12.650
<v Speaker 1>conversation not feeling good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to want to throw out all</v>
