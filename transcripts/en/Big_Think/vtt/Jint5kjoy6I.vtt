1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Now Tony and determinism says that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university has a clock,</v>

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.510
<v Speaker 1>I gigantic clock that's wound up at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of time and it's been ticking</v>

3
00:00:07.511 --> 00:00:10.020
<v Speaker 1>ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to Newton's laws of motion,</v>

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.390
<v Speaker 1>so what you're going to eat 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>from now on January first has already</v>

5
00:00:15.761 --> 00:00:19.210
<v Speaker 1>been fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already known using Newton's laws</v>

6
00:00:19.211 --> 00:00:22.390
<v Speaker 1>of motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein believed in that Einstein was a</v>

7
00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:25.250
<v Speaker 1>determinist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean that a murderer is a</v>

8
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.560
<v Speaker 1>horrible mass murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't really guilty of his works because</v>

9
00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:32.590
<v Speaker 1>it was already preordained billions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

10
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Nine science said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

11
00:00:34.061 --> 00:00:35.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense that's true.</v>

12
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Even mass murderers were predetermined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he said they should still be placed</v>

13
00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:44.380
<v Speaker 1>in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heizer Berta then comes along and</v>

14
00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:47.320
<v Speaker 1>proposes the Heisenberg uncertainty</v>
<v Speaker 1>principle and says,</v>

15
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.540
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's uncertainty.</v>

16
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where the electron is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be here,</v>

17
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.060
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or many places simultaneously.</v>

18
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.940
<v Speaker 1>This of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein hated because he said,</v>

19
00:00:57.941 --> 00:01:00.100
<v Speaker 1>God doesn't play dice with the universe.</v>

20
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

21
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>get used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein was wrong.</v>

22
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 1>God does play dice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time we look at an electron,</v>

23
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>it moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's uncertainty with the regardless</v>

24
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.660
<v Speaker 1>of the position of the electrons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean for freewill?</v>

25
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.500
<v Speaker 1>It means in some sense we do have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of free will.</v>

26
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>No one can determine your future events</v>
<v Speaker 1>given your past history.</v>

27
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.010
<v Speaker 1>There's always the wildcard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always the possibility of</v>

28
00:01:27.011 --> 00:01:30.940
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty in whatever we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I look at myself in the mirror,</v>

29
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I say to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm looking at,</v>

30
00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:36.910
<v Speaker 1>it's not really me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like me,</v>

31
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not meat today.</v>

32
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Now it's me a billionth of a second ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it takes a billionth of a second</v>

33
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:46.330
<v Speaker 1>for light to go for a meeting to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror and back.</v>
