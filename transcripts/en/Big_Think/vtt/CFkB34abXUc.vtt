00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.410
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on the kinds of choices people</v>

2
00:00:14.411 --> 00:00:15.580
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.360
<v Speaker 1>I suppose I would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do more optimistic if I felt other</v>

5
00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:24.040
<v Speaker 1>people were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>less irrationally optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are not fully aware of</v>

7
00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:33.160
<v Speaker 1>some of the risks and some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges we face and because of that</v>

8
00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:35.350
<v Speaker 1>are overly complacent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's,</v>

9
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.770
<v Speaker 1>that seems to me is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 1>a recipe for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.890
<v Speaker 1>dramatically increasing the probability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something very bad,</v>

12
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad happening.</v>

13
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

14
00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:46.181
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

15
00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:47.860
<v Speaker 1>these things are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to,</v>

16
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.420
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to know and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

17
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to know which choices are</v>

18
00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 1>going to be the critical ones and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things are precise and work out</v>

19
00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:57.820
<v Speaker 1>because the world's a big place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of complicated things are,</v>

20
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.160
<v Speaker 1>are going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

21
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.660
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tend to,</v>

22
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.030
<v Speaker 1>I guess my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had,</v>

23
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.490
<v Speaker 1>if I had to makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you held a gun to my head,</v>

24
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.240
<v Speaker 1>forced me to make a prediction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're headed towards,</v>

25
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:14.500
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years of incredible chaos and</v>

27
00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:16.840
<v Speaker 1>turmoil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the tail end of,</v>

28
00:01:16.841 --> 00:01:19.210
<v Speaker 1>we will emerge with a world better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>any weekend</v>

29
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.113
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

30
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
