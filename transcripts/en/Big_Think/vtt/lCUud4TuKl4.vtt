<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the most successful media brands</v>

2
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:19.281
<v Speaker 1>understood some time ago that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mission is really to deliver content</v>

3
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:24.831
<v Speaker 1>across all the platforms that consumers</v>
<v Speaker 1>are embracing and indeed to sell that</v>

4
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>audience to advertisers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

5
00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Speaker 1>for playboy enterprises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were the first national magazine to</v>

6
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:37.770
<v Speaker 1>go up on the web back in 1994.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been delivering content via mobile</v>

7
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>for over five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our mantra is to kind of grow our</v>

8
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>audience and grow our ad sales.</v>
