00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I consider myself a New Yorker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was born in the Great State of New</v>

2
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Jersey at Perth Amboy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>general hospital,</v>

3
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.710
<v Speaker 1>but got out of Highland Park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey to go to boarding school at</v>

4
00:00:17.711 --> 00:00:20.590
<v Speaker 1>age 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew there was a bigger and better</v>

5
00:00:20.591 --> 00:00:22.100
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of us from New Jersey,</v>

6
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:23.920
<v Speaker 1>you have a complex about being from New</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jersey,</v>

7
00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:26.980
<v Speaker 1>but I have written myself of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex because they all have to come</v>

8
00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:31.510
<v Speaker 1>from somewhere and sometimes our</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewheres maybe seemed like nowhere,</v>

9
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.450
<v Speaker 1>but that nowhere gets us to somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it makes us be better.</v>

10
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.630
<v Speaker 1>So I'm proud to be a jersey boy,</v>

11
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 2>but you're making an assumption that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jersey</v>

12
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>symbolizes something and I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that assumption is.</v>

13
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to make things and be something</v>

14
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>and try to create things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And where I came from had nothing to do</v>

15
00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>with stopping or starting the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to do something was driven</v>

16
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>home by my parents.</v>
