<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.850
<v Speaker 2>for someone like me who's written a book</v>
<v Speaker 2>advocating what openly is an idea,</v>

3
00:00:12.851 --> 00:00:15.160
<v Speaker 2>what sticks sounding version of foreign</v>
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>

4
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.550
<v Speaker 2>It's a very hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.440
<v Speaker 2>I think for a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>

6
00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:25.441
<v Speaker 2>One is that eight years of the Bush</v>
<v Speaker 2>administration has not only exhausted</v>

7
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 2>the larger world with this visionary</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweeping language and behavior and</v>

8
00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:35.800
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the American people as well.</v>

9
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.220
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that there is a deep mood</v>
<v Speaker 2>of retrenchment,</v>

10
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country that is a wish,</v>

11
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:46.720
<v Speaker 2>not so much for different foreign policy</v>
<v Speaker 2>though there is that,</v>

12
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.500
<v Speaker 2>but also for less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no grand adventures,</v>

13
00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:55.501
<v Speaker 2>no grandiose language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no talking about the universal</v>

14
00:00:55.931 --> 00:01:00.700
<v Speaker 2>projection of American ideals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you add to that the economic</v>

15
00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:04.150
<v Speaker 2>crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which not only means that foreign policy</v>

16
00:01:04.151 --> 00:01:06.640
<v Speaker 2>is less salient than people would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought it would be,</v>

17
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.000
<v Speaker 2>would have been a couple months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also there's less money to spend on</v>

18
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.340
<v Speaker 2>things that otherwise you might</v>
<v Speaker 2>profitably spend money on.</v>

19
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.440
<v Speaker 2>It is true and it is a rebuke to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>great ambitions of bushes,</v>

20
00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:19.540
<v Speaker 2>freedom agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in fact,</v>

21
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.290
<v Speaker 2>in recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the growth of freedom has been either</v>

22
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:26.680
<v Speaker 2>nail or or negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you measure it this way.</v>

23
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.060
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be cautious about saying there</v>

24
00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:33.850
<v Speaker 2>is this concerted negative trend that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

25
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.420
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about a relatively small</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of countries and it's a,</v>

26
00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:42.421
<v Speaker 2>it's an index that shifts up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can certainly say there was no sign</v>

27
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.160
<v Speaker 2>of that democracy is growing in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

28
00:01:45.161 --> 00:01:49.510
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that would exaggerate the</v>

29
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:54.511
<v Speaker 2>ability of the United States to alter</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are quite profound and</v>

30
00:01:55.751 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 2>deeply rooted in their locality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To think that just because George Bush</v>

31
00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:03.550
<v Speaker 2>screwed up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore the freedom is actually</v>

32
00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:08.551
<v Speaker 2>heading into a nosedive.</v>
