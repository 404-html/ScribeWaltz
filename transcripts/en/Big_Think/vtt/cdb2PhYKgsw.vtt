1
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Was Obama's postpartum and agenda is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he came into it,</v>

2
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:16.990
<v Speaker 1>he came into his presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 1>at a time when millions of Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even tens of millions of</v>

4
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't consider a Democrat president</v>

5
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get sued of liberalism,</v>

6
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>legitimate dunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider the idea of the state for my</v>

7
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>new programs to help people legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:36.580
<v Speaker 1>so he's in a situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot like a,</v>

9
00:00:36.581 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham Lincoln face in 1860,</v>

10
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 1>when you had millions of Americans who</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even consider what was going on</v>

11
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 1>in Washington to have anything to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

12
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.160
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.430
<v Speaker 1>the big question for me was always was</v>
<v Speaker 1>this post partisan idea,</v>

14
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>this idea that you could kind of bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>adversaries across the table and get</v>

15
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>them to agree to each other and agree</v>
<v Speaker 1>with to get them to agree with each</v>

16
00:00:57.421 --> 00:00:59.970
<v Speaker 1>other and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve social progress.</v>

17
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Was that a deep seated belief of his or</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that in a certain sense,</v>

18
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>a tactic?</v>

19
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Not as cynical tactic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a tactic?</v>

20
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.290
<v Speaker 1>I would be very with him if it were a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of thinking about politics,</v>

22
00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>if it were a tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the job of a transformative</v>

23
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:24.261
<v Speaker 1>leader is not too huge the center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to define their own values as the</v>

24
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:28.250
<v Speaker 1>center as commonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

25
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he,</v>

26
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

27
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the agenda he's passed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

28
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>he's putting far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

29
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>universal healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:35.730
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cap and trade and green jobs as a way to</v>

32
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 1>solve our energy problems while growing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economy.</v>

33
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I think these are reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>while liberal goals and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.230
<v Speaker 1>if he presents them as reasonable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reaction to them as one could knew</v>

36
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>they were going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are these millions of</v>

37
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 1>people who don't consider a liberal</v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

38
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Legitimate was irrational extreme that</v>
<v Speaker 1>presented him an opportunity to say,</v>

39
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 1>my program is rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my opposition has chosen extremism,</v>

40
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.460
<v Speaker 1>has chosen unreasoned and be willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the hit that there's always going</v>

41
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>to be a minority of the country.</v>

42
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>30%,</v>
<v Speaker 1>35%,</v>

43
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.540
<v Speaker 1>even 40% who disagrees with him</v>
<v Speaker 1>radically disagrees with him strongly.</v>

44
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.040
<v Speaker 1>But if he's still willing to pass his</v>
<v Speaker 1>program with debt,</v>

45
00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:41.400
<v Speaker 1>60% margin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the country will eventually</v>

46
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:43.420
<v Speaker 1>catch up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reaction.</v>

47
00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Notice we'll understand as they did with</v>
<v Speaker 1>social security as they did with,</v>

48
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women getting the vote,</v>

49
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 1>freeing the slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>a social security that actually these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things were in their interests.</v>

51
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>They'll accept them as part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>established order of American society.</v>

52
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

53
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:01.331
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>

54
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>down years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>years down the road,</v>

55
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.010
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans and the Conservatives</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be campaigning to see if universal</v>

56
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>health care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like they can't paint to save</v>

57
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>social security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is this doesn't really</v>

58
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 1>work unless you make this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>tactical shift.</v>

59
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>If people say that you're illegitimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

60
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your liberal agenda is extremist</v>

61
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 1>socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 1>destroying the America that we all grew</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with.</v>

63
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 1>You have to be willing to say this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable.</v>

64
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>This is extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you aren't able to say this is</v>

65
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable and this is extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're granting your opposition,</v>

66
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an undue influence.</v>

67
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 1>You're basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>negotiating with the under negotiate</v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble.</v>

69
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.970
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>as Abraham Lincoln said quite eloquently</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his 1860 speech at Cooper Union,</v>

71
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't win that way.</v>

72
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.580
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying for years that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are millions of Americans who</v>

74
00:04:03.891 --> 00:04:05.970
<v Speaker 1>basically don't consider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

75
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.290
<v Speaker 1>the liberal project legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They consider it the opposite of what</v>

76
00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:12.260
<v Speaker 1>America means to them and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 1>that they derive their identity from</v>
<v Speaker 1>questioning the legitimacy and the</v>

78
00:04:18.111 --> 00:04:22.130
<v Speaker 1>ability of the liberal government to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to function peacefully.</v>

79
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.870
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.380
<v Speaker 1>I think that for a couple months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.050
<v Speaker 1>even more maybe six months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:04:30.051 --> 00:04:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama's charisma and his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>his remarkable popularity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.780
<v Speaker 1>kind of stunned some of these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>into silence.</v>

85
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I think people couldn't quite believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're saying.</v>

86
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.270
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

87
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.930
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at it historically,</v>

88
00:04:44.931 --> 00:04:45.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.090
<v Speaker 1>quite continuous with what happened when</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Clinton became president.</v>

90
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you began to hear people,</v>

91
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a accusing him of,</v>

92
00:04:54.051 --> 00:04:54.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.660
<v Speaker 1>murdering his aids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

94
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.110
<v Speaker 1>when you began to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.970
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.290
<v Speaker 1>saying that he was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

97
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient for a,</v>

98
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.130
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he had visited when he was a</v>

99
00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:06.140
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when he was a teenager,</v>

100
00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:07.250
<v Speaker 1>when he was in college.</v>

101
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.610
<v Speaker 1>And you saw the same thing when Jimmy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carter became president.</v>

102
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.670
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

103
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

104
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.630
<v Speaker 1>he was immediately considered a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

105
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt Democratic Party establishment.</v>

106
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happened every time a Democrat was</v>

107
00:05:24.651 --> 00:05:26.090
<v Speaker 1>elected in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will happen.</v>

108
00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Every time a Democrat is elected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

109
00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:30.800
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of our patrimony as Americans.</v>

110
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 1>And the challenge for a Barack Obama or</v>
<v Speaker 1>any democrat or any liberal is to</v>

111
00:05:37.701 --> 00:05:40.790
<v Speaker 1>understand that this is just part of who</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are as Americans.</v>

112
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.340
<v Speaker 1>To acknowledge it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to respect it,</v>

113
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.220
<v Speaker 1>and to transcend it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

114
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lion can lay down with the lamb,</v>

116
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.030
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to last for very</v>
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
