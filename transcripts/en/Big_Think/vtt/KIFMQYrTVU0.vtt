00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Utmost respect for snl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people sometimes take shots at them.</v>

3
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I think that's a great show</v>

4
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.250
<v Speaker 1>and I feel like the cast right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have like a smaller,</v>

5
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.150
<v Speaker 1>tighter tasks and it's actually like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really feel like one of the strongest</v>

6
00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:30.250
<v Speaker 1>casts that that they've had in a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

7
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.270
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like people aren't</v>

9
00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:37.060
<v Speaker 1>catching that show every week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only because I,</v>

10
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>there might be a perception that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

11
00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:41.530
<v Speaker 1>this is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this legendary show.</v>

12
00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:42.364
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people may feel like,</v>

14
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.750
<v Speaker 1>oh well they'll catch it whenever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like some of that is due to like</v>

15
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.390
<v Speaker 1>what we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the changing nature of how people are</v>

16
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.220
<v Speaker 1>finding stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

17
00:00:51.221 --> 00:00:53.470
<v Speaker 1>people watch stuff on the internet and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

18
00:00:53.471 --> 00:00:54.280
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

19
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I feel like right now that cast is</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally strong and solid and like pound</v>

20
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:01.300
<v Speaker 1>for pound I sure like always makes me</v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh.</v>

21
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always something funny every</v>

22
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.570
<v Speaker 1>week on that show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

23
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.690
<v Speaker 1>I think the challenge of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of doing some stuff on that show is just</v>

24
00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:08.680
<v Speaker 1>the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>that it's a live show every week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really hard to do a live</v>

26
00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:16.030
<v Speaker 1>show every week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people,</v>

27
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.650
<v Speaker 1>I think people kind of think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.770
<v Speaker 1>that's not impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

29
00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:23.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure probably impossible to pull</v>
<v Speaker 1>that off.</v>

30
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be exhausting.</v>

31
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.003
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like,</v>

33
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.010
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about comedy is that like</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everything ever hits,</v>

35
00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:35.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:01:35.651 --> 00:01:37.720
<v Speaker 1>comedy is completely subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:01:37.721 --> 00:01:40.180
<v Speaker 1>no one likes every single thing that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

38
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people don't like any of those.</v>

39
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.590
<v Speaker 1>We'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom,</v>

40
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.150
<v Speaker 1>my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

41
00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:49.360
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show my mom told me over Christmas that</v>

42
00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:51.580
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking and she goes,</v>

43
00:01:51.581 --> 00:01:54.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said something about our show coming</v>

44
00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:56.710
<v Speaker 1>on and my mom was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm thoroughly embarrassed by your show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

46
00:02:00.941 --> 00:02:02.260
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

47
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it's crude and it's a vulgar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is,</v>

48
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.530
<v Speaker 1>I guess it is crude and vulgar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

49
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

50
00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:11.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's purely subjective.</v>

51
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing with snl too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

52
00:02:14.351 --> 00:02:15.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.600
<v Speaker 1>people watch that and some people will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

54
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.570
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get it.</v>

55
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:18.430
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.650
<v Speaker 1>comedy is subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like not everything is going to hit with</v>

57
00:02:20.651 --> 00:02:21.484
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

58
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

59
00:02:22.451 --> 00:02:24.340
<v Speaker 1>that shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like that shows</v>

60
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.780
<v Speaker 2>got some funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny stuff.</v>
