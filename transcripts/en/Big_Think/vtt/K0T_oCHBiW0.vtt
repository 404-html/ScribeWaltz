1
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of people who say,</v>

2
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need new inventions,</v>

3
00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:19.570
<v Speaker 1>new breakthrough technologies for plugin</v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicles to be practical.</v>

4
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.210
<v Speaker 1>And our position from the start has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>w they are way better than good enough</v>

5
00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:27.400
<v Speaker 1>to get started right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

6
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.480
<v Speaker 1>the batteries we have and the motors and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the electronics we have are able to make</v>

7
00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:35.770
<v Speaker 1>great vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.920
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be great to have better batteries</v>

9
00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:42.520
<v Speaker 1>someday as they come in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's icing on the cake right now.</v>

10
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a good economics case for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>battery technology.</v>

11
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.100
<v Speaker 1>And then on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every alternative fuel needs a new</v>

12
00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:54.430
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure or new scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakthroughs except this one.</v>

13
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need new fueling infrastructure for</v>

14
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:01.360
<v Speaker 1>a alternative fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for biofuels.</v>

15
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.260
<v Speaker 1>You need to create more for natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>guests.</v>

16
00:01:05.261 --> 00:01:07.480
<v Speaker 1>The same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of our big,</v>

17
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of our big gimmicks we had when we</v>

18
00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:16.420
<v Speaker 1>started Kalkaska as we walked around</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this and we said every alternative</v>

19
00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:20.710
<v Speaker 1>fuel vehicle needs a new in new</v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure except this,</v>

20
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.410
<v Speaker 1>the plugin card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is connects you to today's</v>

21
00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:27.610
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A one 20 volt plug can power most cars.</v>

22
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.310
<v Speaker 1>And when you get to a truck or a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicle,</v>

23
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.500
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take too long on one 20.</v>

24
00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:34.840
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to need the dryer plug</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your garage,</v>

25
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.230
<v Speaker 1>a two 40 and you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is we have the</v>

26
00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:40.780
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fueling infrastructure for cars.</v>

27
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 1>When cal cars was founded and we did our</v>
<v Speaker 1>first conversions,</v>

28
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we put it all into the public domain and</v>

29
00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 1>we enabled individuals to do their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversions.</v>

30
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>At that point it was a strategic goal to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get enough plugin hybrids around the</v>

31
00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>country to show what was possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>

32
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.650
<v Speaker 1>a small ecosystem of companies has grown</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to do conversions of hybrids of</v>

33
00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Prius's and that's a mock at around a</v>
<v Speaker 1>million vehicles perhaps.</v>

34
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 1>So those companies are moving ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them have gotten all the federal</v>

35
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:18.740
<v Speaker 1>approvals and crash testing and so forth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

36
00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:20.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a business opportunity.</v>

37
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 1>We think there's a much larger business</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for companies to convert</v>

38
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>some of the 250 million vehicles that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not hybrids,</v>

39
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.260
<v Speaker 1>the big gas guzzlers and some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was in the u s and 900 million in</v>

40
00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of companies will do that</v>

41
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 1>where the federal government comes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and where local governments come in is</v>

42
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Speaker 1>in helping us get there quicker.</v>

43
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>So right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

44
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>if you buy a new plug in vehicle in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next year or two,</v>

45
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>you'll get a $7,500 tax credit from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>federal government,</v>

46
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>which will help a lot to bring down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>price.</v>

47
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are other places in the world</v>

48
00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>which have even higher incentives in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

49
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.800
<v Speaker 1>and there are places that are using tax</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy and so forth because the reason</v>

50
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 1>why we have that credit is not simply</v>
<v Speaker 1>the practical reason of helping these</v>

51
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 1>companies get started and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because the buyer doesn't get a lot</v>

52
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>of the social benefits that are driving</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

53
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zipper or a plugin hybrid brings.</v>

54
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>It brings some benefits to the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>society and reducing energy insecurity</v>

55
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:28.651
<v Speaker 1>and and emissions and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you incentivize the buyer for higher</v>

56
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 1>first costs for those vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

57
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 1>at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within a few years,</v>

58
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:35.580
<v Speaker 1>it's very possible that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be cheaper to actually buy a</v>

60
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>plugin car than a regular car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it'll be a no brainer at that point</v>

61
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 1>when we get to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the incentives will be less necessary.</v>
