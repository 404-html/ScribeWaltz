00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Our brains are cunningly evolved</v>
<v Speaker 1>cunningly designed to make life easier</v>

2
00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:25.451
<v Speaker 1>for us and many ways that it makes life</v>
<v Speaker 1>easier for us.</v>

3
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:30.710
<v Speaker 1>But one of them is that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives us over simplified versions of,</v>

4
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.900
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what we're doing.</v>

5
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:38.750
<v Speaker 1>this is a set of tricks which has been a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of reinvented by software</v>

7
00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:41.300
<v Speaker 1>engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your desktop is a pretty good case of</v>

8
00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:42.620
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have these,</v>

9
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little little yellow files that can be</v>

10
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:48.650
<v Speaker 1>moved around with click and drag and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things get put here and there.</v>

11
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.090
<v Speaker 1>And this is called the user illusion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a losery to some degree,</v>

12
00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:54.920
<v Speaker 1>but of course it's a very benign</v>
<v Speaker 1>illusion.</v>

13
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:55.850
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

14
00:00:55.851 --> 00:00:59.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a helpful way of organizing a lot</v>

15
00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:02.240
<v Speaker 1>of complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to know all those details.</v>

16
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.900
<v Speaker 1>We just need to know how to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain effects.</v>

17
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.680
<v Speaker 1>And basically our brain does the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and has,</v>

18
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.070
<v Speaker 1>has been doing it for Millennia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

19
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.380
<v Speaker 1>it's got its evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of internal signposts that are</v>

20
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.260
<v Speaker 1>a good shorthand for things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can do everywhere we look.</v>

21
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.590
<v Speaker 1>There's things we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how we do them.</v>

22
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

23
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.270
<v Speaker 1>we're completely cut off from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the process.</v>

24
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.760
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I say,</v>

25
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.981
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:38.770
<v Speaker 1>give me the first line of limerick</v>
<v Speaker 1>makeup,</v>

28
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>the first line of a limit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

29
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me a few seconds and you'll come up</v>

30
00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 1>with two or three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd you do that?</v>

31
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.863
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

32
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.620
<v Speaker 1>The words just come sort of bubbling up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have any insight into the</v>

33
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>sort of subterranean unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>processes that generates that particular</v>

34
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:57.320
<v Speaker 1>district.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may have a little insight,</v>

35
00:01:57.321 --> 00:01:59.590
<v Speaker 1>but not much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

36
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.800
<v Speaker 1>there's a very sharp limit to the depth</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we as conscious agents can probe</v>

37
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.160
<v Speaker 1>our own activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

38
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

39
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of superficial,</v>

40
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>access that we have to what's going on.</v>

41
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.340
<v Speaker 1>That's what consciousness is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when I say,</v>

42
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.941
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's this?</v>

43
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:28.100
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's got this access?</v>

44
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.500
<v Speaker 1>That's itself part of the illusion</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there isn't a sort of boss,</v>

45
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the brain that's sitting there,</v>

46
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this limited access that itself is,</v>

47
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

48
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.820
<v Speaker 1>is part of the illusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>

49
00:02:42.821 --> 00:02:46.730
<v Speaker 1>is a bunch of different subsystems which</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

50
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>varying access,</v>

51
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.530
<v Speaker 1>the varying things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that conspire in a sort of</v>

52
00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:56.531
<v Speaker 1>competitive way to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to execute whatever projects it is that</v>

53
00:02:57.291 --> 00:02:58.310
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.900
<v Speaker 1>in their sort of mindless way.</v>
