1
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Political comedies just as easy now as</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was during the Bush years.</v>

2
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.060
<v Speaker 1>It still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.380
<v Speaker 1>it's a different cast of characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got all the same foibles.</v>

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking for myself,</v>

8
00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:24.120
<v Speaker 1>I certainly like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

9
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.760
<v Speaker 1>and trust our president now more than I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did our previous one.</v>

10
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.780
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.370
<v Speaker 1>he makes plenty of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.570
<v Speaker 1>goofs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.730
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly don't approve of everything</v>

14
00:00:33.731 --> 00:00:34.210
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

15
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.030
<v Speaker 1>and there's a cast of characters in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington right now that are,</v>

16
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.580
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As hilarious as,</v>

18
00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.890
<v Speaker 1>as anyone who was there during the Bush</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

19
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 1>we're always looking to keep it fresh</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

20
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.000
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

21
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.170
<v Speaker 1>and that's not so much because we need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're scared we're going to lose the</v>

22
00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:52.520
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more,</v>

23
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to lose our own interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

24
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

25
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:57.710
<v Speaker 1>you do the show four days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.470
<v Speaker 1>however many weeks a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get bored by doing it.</v>

27
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>So we have to keep making it exciting</v>
<v Speaker 1>for ourselves.</v>

28
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 1>So there's absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

29
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that and it was like,</v>

30
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>let's try something new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it might be hard.</v>

31
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>And there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

33
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a group of very competitive,</v>

34
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:18.420
<v Speaker 1>funny people and we'd like to make each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other laugh.</v>

35
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.093
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

37
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.600
<v Speaker 1>we know what a standard show could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're always trying to break out of</v>

38
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>that just so we can impress each other.</v>

39
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

40
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.180
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.990
<v Speaker 1>the hardest part for me in a work</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment is collaboration.</v>

42
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that,</v>

43
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>that's just a struggle I've always had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

44
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.300
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love my coworkers and I love,</v>

45
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.860
<v Speaker 1>bouncing ideas around with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

47
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:47.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoy pure riding,</v>

48
00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:49.930
<v Speaker 1>just sitting and writing by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

49
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and every show is different.</v>

50
00:01:51.641 --> 00:01:53.710
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the most collaborative</v>

51
00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:56.830
<v Speaker 1>environment I've ever been in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to ride on a TV show called news</v>

52
00:01:56.831 --> 00:01:58.900
<v Speaker 1>radio where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.130
<v Speaker 1>it was very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have a,</v>

54
00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:02.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.040
<v Speaker 1>any sort of big table or anything where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where ideas are bounced around.</v>

56
00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:07.370
<v Speaker 1>We Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.550
<v Speaker 1>you'd come up with a script idea and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd go off and write it.</v>

58
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.680
<v Speaker 1>You need to hand it to the next guy up</v>
<v Speaker 1>the food chain.</v>

59
00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:13.180
<v Speaker 1>And he would rewrite it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

60
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

61
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as pure writing experience as you can</v>

62
00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:19.300
<v Speaker 1>get an insert of the TV world.</v>

63
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.650
<v Speaker 1>The main difference between the two is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the immediacy there,</v>

64
00:02:23.651 --> 00:02:25.780
<v Speaker 1>the daily show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the news hits,</v>

65
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.500
<v Speaker 1>and we get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get to take care of it that night.</v>

66
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.753
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the simpsons,</v>

67
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.250
<v Speaker 1>such a strange animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

68
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.350
<v Speaker 1>and a wonderful animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a strange one,</v>

69
00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:38.770
<v Speaker 1>you would be writing for something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't air for nine months to a year</v>

70
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.480
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's still,</v>

71
00:02:40.481 --> 00:02:41.410
<v Speaker 1>people would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

72
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:42.760
<v Speaker 1>how did you get that reference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

73
00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:43.481
<v Speaker 1>so quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

74
00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:44.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

75
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently it would seem like,</v>

76
00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:47.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.190
<v Speaker 1>the show was present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

78
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed the simpsons,</v>

79
00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:52.691
<v Speaker 1>but I tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

80
00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>I like the immediacy of the daily show</v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

81
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.240
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was free.</v>

82
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.960
<v Speaker 1>It's frustrating to write something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then not see the finished product,</v>

83
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.771
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

84
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>

85
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the daily show.</v>

86
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're really putting on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

87
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

88
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm Mickey Rooney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

89
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing a script and that night it</v>

90
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 1>goes live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's terrible,</v>

91
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do another show tomorrow night.</v>

92
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

93
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

94
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.831
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

95
00:03:15.831 --> 00:03:17.540
<v Speaker 1>we're not so different from everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

96
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I'm particularly funny in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this interview anyway,</v>

97
00:03:19.971 --> 00:03:21.350
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

98
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't always have to be funny.</v>

99
00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:25.820
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

100
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.043
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>W I,</v>

102
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.480
<v Speaker 1>I think we can be just as adequate at</v>
<v Speaker 1>managing people as others and,</v>

103
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

104
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.813
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

105
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.840
<v Speaker 1>it's all management skills that go into</v>
<v Speaker 1>our wheelhouse.</v>

106
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.760
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

107
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.791
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

108
00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:40.550
<v Speaker 1>I read a script.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't funny.</v>

109
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.020
<v Speaker 1>This is what you need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boop,</v>

110
00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:42.630
<v Speaker 1>boop,</v>

111
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.670

<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

112
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.620
<v Speaker 1>if I were an accountant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be able to point out,</v>

113
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the numbers didn't add up.</v>

114
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:03:49.311 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>if I'm watching a montage and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't go together quite right,</v>

116
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.910
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it as someone who is a professional is a</v>

117
00:03:55.911 --> 00:03:57.420
<v Speaker 1>comedy professional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

119
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.870
<v Speaker 1>I can point out what's going to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

120
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you what,</v>

121
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.560

<v Speaker 1>everyone at the show is so nice and,</v>

122
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:06.031
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

123
00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>and so shockingly competent that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

124
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a real problem.</v>

125
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in situations where,</v>

126
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there've been people who are difficult</v>

127
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who just didn't want to be</v>

128
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:18.000
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

129
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.390
<v Speaker 1>people you had to manage more heavily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

130
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing like that there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

131
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.730
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of that has to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

132
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the fact that it's such a fast</v>

133
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:28.720
<v Speaker 1>moving machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who,</v>

134
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.290
<v Speaker 1>who acts as any sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

135
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.310
<v Speaker 1>sand in the gears get spit out pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

136
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
