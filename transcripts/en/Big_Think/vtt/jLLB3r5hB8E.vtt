1
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first step,</v>

2
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I use the East West</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradigm is because the West has</v>

3
00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:19.711
<v Speaker 1>dominated world history for 200 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's been the prevailing narrative</v>

4
00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:25.660
<v Speaker 1>for 200 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That narrative is coming to an end.</v>

5
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.950
<v Speaker 1>So it's important to emphasize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the one night is coming to an end</v>

6
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.780
<v Speaker 1>now the Eco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.230
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's remarkably diverse.</v>

8
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:38.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and India you mentioned are very</v>

9
00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:41.440
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what most western minds don't</v>

10
00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:46.441
<v Speaker 1>realize is that in previous centuries</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were a lot of connections among</v>

11
00:00:47.051 --> 00:00:50.180
<v Speaker 1>the Asian countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fairly deep connection.</v>

12
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.140
<v Speaker 1>To illustrate this with my Mike Best of</v>
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>

13
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>now I'm ethnically cindy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cindy is a province in Pakistan and my</v>

14
00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:00.880
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was born a Hindu.</v>

15
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet when I grew up,</v>

16
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.970
<v Speaker 1>the script that I learned to write with</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a Hindu,</v>

17
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.110
<v Speaker 1>the right cindy is the Arabic script and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shows the connection,</v>

18
00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:14.140
<v Speaker 1>the Hindu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cindy's halfway the Islamic world,</v>

19
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Arab,</v>

20
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

21
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.790
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Arab world and in pressure.</v>

22
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.170
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time when I traveled to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the East Asia,</v>

23
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.590
<v Speaker 1>when I go to Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I go to Korea,</v>

24
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.980
<v Speaker 1>when I go to China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still feel a sense of cultural</v>

25
00:01:29.981 --> 00:01:34.060
<v Speaker 1>affinity because I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like an understand the Buddhist</v>

26
00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:38.440
<v Speaker 1>cultures that revealing those societies</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what does it came from India and</v>

27
00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:40.600
<v Speaker 1>I had some Buddhists influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:42.760
<v Speaker 1>in my life too as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

29
00:01:42.761 --> 00:01:45.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that in my personal case,</v>

30
00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 1>if I can personally feel connected with</v>
<v Speaker 1>West Asia.</v>

31
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you personally connected with East</v>

32
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an illustration of how Aisha</v>

33
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.260
<v Speaker 1>comes together in many ways that is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>understood by the West.</v>

34
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
