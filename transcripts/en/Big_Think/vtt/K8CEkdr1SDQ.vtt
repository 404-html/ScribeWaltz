1
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.420
<v Speaker 1>All I have to say as I hope there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a thing as clean coal.</v>

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.410
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:08.411 --> 00:00:13.411
<v Speaker 1>and of course that means that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>burn coal and completely capture the co</v>

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>two and then cause sequestered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly not an easy thing to</v>

5
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I keep reminding people as a</v>

6
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>kol is the world's most abundant energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Now you can argue whether it's as</v>
<v Speaker 1>abundant as solar or wind,</v>

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.030
<v Speaker 1>but certainly in terms of conventional</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources and what people forget is that</v>

9
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:37.050
<v Speaker 1>coal employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally tens of thousands of people</v>

10
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only in our own country,</v>

11
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>but in places like India and China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is cheap.</v>

12
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very difficult for emerging</v>
<v Speaker 1>market countries that are trying to</v>

13
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 1>electrify to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.930
<v Speaker 1>the grow their economies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

15
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.180
<v Speaker 1>economically it's very difficult for</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to simply say,</v>

16
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to stop using coal because</v>

17
00:00:55.981 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>of concerns about climate change because</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only will they throw thousands of</v>

18
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>people out of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they will not then,</v>

19
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>and probably in the near term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a readily available alternative,</v>

20
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to replace the coal generated</v>

21
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>electricity.</v>

22
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.540
<v Speaker 1>That's leading to these explosive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>levels of economic growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I hope that we put a lot of research</v>

24
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:16.770
<v Speaker 1>and development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

25
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are essentially three major ways</v>

26
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 1>that we think about right now to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.100
<v Speaker 1>to potentially have clean call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One involves taking the coo to help me</v>

28
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:31.770
<v Speaker 1>for combustion and to capturing it after</v>
<v Speaker 1>combustion.</v>

29
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>But I would like to see us cooperate</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the other big coal users and</v>

30
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia and China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>India,</v>

31
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 1>and maybe jointly embark on some</v>
<v Speaker 1>research and development projects using</v>

32
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 1>these three technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

33
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not see it as a commercial gain of one</v>

34
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:50.010
<v Speaker 1>country is going to learn how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not other,</v>

35
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:50.990
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Santa,</v>

36
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>the rubric of the global good that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>all do it together.</v>

37
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:56.160
<v Speaker 1>And then your share the benefits</v>
<v Speaker 1>accordingly.</v>
