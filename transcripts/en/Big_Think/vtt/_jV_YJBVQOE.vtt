1
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned,</v>

2
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm at Washington University,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in St Louis.</v>

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>It's actually quite a beautiful city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved there from Oakland,</v>

4
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>California was the place I had lived</v>
<v Speaker 1>before that and moving.</v>

5
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:18.930
<v Speaker 1>They're having only lived on both sides</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the country and never in the middle</v>

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.080
<v Speaker 1>and I guess moving in particular to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>city really opened my eyes to some of</v>

7
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>the systemic racism that was apparent in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city.</v>

8
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a great place and it also has a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>divide,</v>

9
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.310
<v Speaker 1>in fact locally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not sure if this goes on outside</v>

10
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>of the city as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's often referred to as the divided</v>

11
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 1>city and there's even a line that</v>
<v Speaker 1>demarcates where that divide takes</v>

12
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live one block from that line and I</v>

13
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:46.870
<v Speaker 1>was seeing regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of things happened that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>really eyeopening to me.</v>

15
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the country's eyes got</v>

16
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>opened even wider after Ferguson and</v>
<v Speaker 1>many other events that continue to</v>

17
00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 1>happen around the country.</v>

18
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a developmental psychologist,</v>

19
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I really took a lot of this to heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was thinking about my kids and</v>

20
00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>the kids that I was seeing in my lab and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those kids that weren't coming into my</v>

21
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>lab and then I know that lived across</v>
<v Speaker 1>that line and what should we,</v>

22
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>could we potentially be doing both for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids,</v>

23
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>but also looking at kids with some hope</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the future.</v>

24
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Now what we do know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>sadly in children is that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>already has implicit biases that you can</v>

26
00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 1>pick up and observing kids at five to</v>
<v Speaker 1>six years of age.</v>

27
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>This is one example of a study that my</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleague Melanie killen did.</v>

28
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.050
<v Speaker 1>She is at University of Maryland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so close to Baltimore.</v>

29
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>And what she found is that different</v>
<v Speaker 1>children will interpret this scene,</v>

30
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>these scenes very differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

31
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 1>And what she discovered in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this particular study is that black</v>

32
00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:53.841
<v Speaker 1>kids actually are much more optimistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>about race than white kids already by</v>

33
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>first grade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the kid she tested in this</v>

34
00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>study.</v>

35
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 1>The white kids were having much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative or pessimistic kinds of</v>

36
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>interpretations than the black children</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are trying to have much more</v>

37
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.110
<v Speaker 1>positive interpretation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation that's positive,</v>

38
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:07.944
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be like,</v>

39
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like he fell off the off the</v>

40
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>swing and the other kid was waiting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he needed help.</v>

41
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a not so positive interpretation would</v>

42
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:19.560
<v Speaker 1>be something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he pushed him off the swing so</v>

43
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>that he could use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

44
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>So what we were thinking about is how</v>
<v Speaker 1>might we go ahead and take action and be</v>

45
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:29.190
<v Speaker 1>looking at the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could we do earlier?</v>

46
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Are we already seeing that these biases</v>
<v Speaker 1>are developing already in the preschool</v>

47
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What might we be doing?</v>

48
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other ways that we could step in and</v>

49
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:38.120
<v Speaker 1>intervene on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

50
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>So we know that babies notice</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences between people of all kinds.</v>

51
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Whether people speak different</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

52
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>have different color skin act</v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

53
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.280
<v Speaker 1>We also know that by three years of age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children are already noticing power and</v>

54
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:56.190
<v Speaker 1>status differences and that by five or</v>
<v Speaker 1>six years of age,</v>

55
00:02:56.191 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're already seeing implicit biases</v>

56
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 1>about these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is happening in the preschool</v>

57
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we wanted to ask a few questions.</v>

58
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm only going to show you two things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've been looking at this.</v>

59
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now our participants are.</v>

60
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Our kids that are in these studies are</v>
<v Speaker 1>at preschools all over the city of St</v>

61
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Louis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to report today data that's</v>

62
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:18.410
<v Speaker 1>coming from kids that are on in racially</v>
<v Speaker 1>homogenous schools,</v>

63
00:03:18.411 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>so their schools that are mostly all</v>
<v Speaker 1>black kids and black teachers or mostly</v>

64
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>all white kids and white teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're also testing at a number of</v>

65
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>mixed schools that are in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the kids in the homogenous</v>

66
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 1>schools also come from a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>homogenous neighborhoods of both races</v>

67
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>and we put them in these two tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accuracy task,</v>

68
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>which is just having somebody named</v>
<v Speaker 1>those three objects and either saying</v>

69
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 1>them accurately.</v>

70
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a cup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a ball and it's a book or naming</v>

71
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 1>them wrong inaccurately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a pencil.</v>

72
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a fork and it's a shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

73
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 1>and what we see in lots and lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies previously by many colleagues of</v>

74
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>mine and myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that children prefer the person who</v>

75
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>is accurate and they also refer to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that person.</v>

76
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>So we wanted to ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here is all we did was change out the</v>

77
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 1>race of one of these speakers and ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>them which one of these people would you</v>

78
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 1>like to have as your teacher can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did that in accuracy tasks.</v>

79
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.540
<v Speaker 1>So one of these was always accurate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one wasn't okay.</v>

80
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Then we also put them into a simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher preference task.</v>

81
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>We didn't give them any background</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

82
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>We just asked which of these would you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to have is your teacher.</v>

83
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 1>And these were always different people.</v>

84
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>I think I may have put the same faces</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

85
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 1>but they're always different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we found in these racially</v>

86
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>homogenous schools is that both white</v>
<v Speaker 1>and black children were.</v>

87
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 1>They wanted an accurate person to teach</v>
<v Speaker 1>them stuff and to be their teacher.</v>

88
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>So it didn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black,</v>

89
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:44.920
<v Speaker 1>white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted the accurate person.</v>

90
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 1>That's who they wanted to be their</v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher.</v>

91
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we simply asked them,</v>

92
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 1>which one of these people do you prefer</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be your teacher?</v>

93
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Both races have kids preferred the white</v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher.</v>

94
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave that there for a minute just</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sync.</v>

95
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 1>These are three to six year old kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

96
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 1>We also put them in a marshmallow task</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Eshkol range,</v>

97
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.220
<v Speaker 1>which has long been used to look at how</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids delay gratification.</v>

98
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 1>That has all kinds of successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>outcomes,</v>

99
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>but we wanted to look at something else</v>
<v Speaker 1>more recently.</v>

100
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Some findings have suggested that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might get different effects in this</v>

101
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 1>marshmallow test depending on how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>you trust that the speaker is going to</v>

102
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:21.371
<v Speaker 1>come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

103
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 1>so we wanted to use this as sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>measure of trust in the speaker and what</v>

104
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>we did is present put kids again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black or white kids,</v>

105
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>and the only difference between them was</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they got a black experimenter or</v>

106
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:35.470
<v Speaker 1>the wide experiment to do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>marshmallow task with them and this is</v>

107
00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 1>all they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're sat down at a table in a room.</v>

108
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>You're given a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enticing marshmallow and they're told</v>

109
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 1>just wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be back and if you don't</v>

110
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 1>eat that before I get back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to actually give you another</v>

111
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 1>marshmallow so you'll have to buy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they leave the room.</v>

112
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.790
<v Speaker 1>They're being filmed in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we see what's going on and we know</v>

113
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:56.791
<v Speaker 1>how long they waited and what we found</v>
<v Speaker 1>again is that black waited exactly same</v>

114
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 1>amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't matter if the experimenter was</v>

115
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:03.500
<v Speaker 1>white or black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The white kids,</v>

116
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 1>we did significantly longer if the</v>
<v Speaker 1>experimenter was white.</v>

117
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of these things suggest to us that</v>

118
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 1>there is already something going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting at three years of age and up</v>

119
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 1>and that there's a lot of work that</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to be done to the snip these in</v>

120
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 1>the bud while we still have these kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>before other things can be happening.</v>

121
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

122
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 1>now we are testing at mixed race</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>

123
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that some of this will come</v>
<v Speaker 1>out a little bit differently,</v>

124
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.630
<v Speaker 1>but we will learn from that and see what</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure and interaction can do.</v>

125
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 1>We do know that cross race friendship is</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the best predictors of a lessened</v>

126
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.850
<v Speaker 1>bias across races and other social</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>

127
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quickly because I know I need to wrap</v>

128
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:47.300
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to present this idea that</v>

129
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.500
<v Speaker 1>what it must be like I'm in a world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if kids,</v>

130
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 1>when when you are a minority and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything isn't presented to look like</v>

131
00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:58.250
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what a black child typically</v>

132
00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.920
<v Speaker 1>feels like when they go to the store to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick her doll or when they go to the</v>

133
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 1>bookstore to look at books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for examples of things that</v>

134
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:05.930
<v Speaker 1>represent me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are like me,</v>

135
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:08.570
<v Speaker 1>that I can relate with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can learn from and relate to.</v>

136
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.520
<v Speaker 1>And so what if white kids had that same</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of understanding and it gave them a</v>

137
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:18.521
<v Speaker 1>better way or a more clear view of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world was like.</v>

138
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there is one such organization that</v>

139
00:07:21.081 --> 00:07:23.060
<v Speaker 1>I've been really lucky to partner with</v>
<v Speaker 1>in St Louis.</v>

140
00:07:23.061 --> 00:07:25.910
<v Speaker 1>It's called stories and stories.</v>

141
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Is is introducing white families and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed race families to um,</v>

142
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.720
<v Speaker 1>more diverse books and helping parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>have conversations about race in their</v>

143
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:38.960
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A black families tend to have much more</v>

144
00:07:38.961 --> 00:07:42.980
<v Speaker 1>conversation about race because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to then white families that tend to</v>

145
00:07:42.981 --> 00:07:46.400
<v Speaker 1>have difficulty talking about these</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues with their kids even if they're</v>

146
00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:49.130
<v Speaker 1>well intended and want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's challenging so they're giving them</v>

147
00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:51.680
<v Speaker 1>the books and the resources with which</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do this.</v>

148
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.550
<v Speaker 1>And this is already really taking fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a huge wait list.</v>

149
00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:59.840
<v Speaker 1>They've already worked with I think 500</v>
<v Speaker 1>and something families in the St Louis</v>

150
00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:03.020
<v Speaker 1>area and there's 400 or so families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least on the waitlist.</v>

151
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.470
<v Speaker 1>They can't move along as fast as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've partnered with them both as</v>

152
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 1>member in the program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also I'm doing some of the research</v>

153
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:12.230
<v Speaker 1>to see the effect of exposure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

154
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 1>through diverse exposure to diversity</v>
<v Speaker 1>through books.</v>

155
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 1>If that can have any kind of impact and</v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

156
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.360
<v Speaker 1>One important thing about this program</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that not only is as opposed to impact</v>

157
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:22.340
<v Speaker 1>the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it already has and we see the</v>

158
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:26.060
<v Speaker 1>effects of it impacting the parents so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that parents caring about this,</v>

159
00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:30.200
<v Speaker 1>it's making them much more committed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing change in the region and making</v>

160
00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:32.090
<v Speaker 1>sure that their kids grow up thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

161
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:37.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave you soon with a quote from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baldwin who said that I can't be a</v>

162
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:41.180
<v Speaker 1>pessimist because I'm alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be a pessimist means that you have</v>

163
00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:43.550
<v Speaker 1>agreed that human life is an academic</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

164
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.970
<v Speaker 1>So I'm forced to be an optimist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm forced to believe that we can</v>

165
00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:49.820
<v Speaker 1>survive whatever it is we must survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

166
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.750
<v Speaker 1>But we don't have to survive everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the things we need to figure out</v>

167
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.030
<v Speaker 1>and we can change them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really have.</v>

168
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm having the audacity of hope for</v>
<v Speaker 1>racial equity,</v>

169
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep moving forward.</v>

170
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 1>And I want to leave with this quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

171
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was struggling not only with the</v>

172
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>things that were going on in my city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around me,</v>

173
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.560
<v Speaker 1>but then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

174
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 1>campaigns and elections last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I say,</v>

175
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.690
<v Speaker 1>why should we do anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no hope.</v>

176
00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:21.690
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this gave me some hope,</v>

177
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.540
<v Speaker 1>actually some optimism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't read it,</v>

178
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.460
<v Speaker 1>there's one of his little creatures that</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

179
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.800
<v Speaker 1>why so optimistic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>About 2017.</v>

180
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.350
<v Speaker 1>What do you think it will bring?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other one says,</v>

181
00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:34.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it will bring flowers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

182
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.320
<v Speaker 1>How come?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I am planting flowers and what</v>

183
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:44.220
<v Speaker 1>optimism can do is give us the faith</v>
<v Speaker 1>that eventually takes us to seeing some</v>

184
00:09:44.221 --> 00:09:46.440
<v Speaker 1>improvement to seeing some achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

185
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is going to be able to be done</v>
<v Speaker 1>without the ability for us to be able to</v>

186
00:09:50.221 --> 00:09:53.910
<v Speaker 1>imagine what isn't there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how things could be changed or imagine</v>

187
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:57.840
<v Speaker 1>the ways in which things aren't already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that requires hope.</v>

188
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.480
<v Speaker 1>So for hope and optimism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

189
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 1>this is my view of how these come</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

190
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:07.140
<v Speaker 1>And I ask that you planted lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>flowers.</v>
