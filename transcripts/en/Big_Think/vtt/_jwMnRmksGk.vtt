1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.300
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we really see our role as,</v>

4
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.010
<v Speaker 2>as a starting point for people when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're looking for news.</v>

5
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our goal is really to try and help</v>

6
00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:20.830
<v Speaker 2>people find the information they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for yet in that way it's,</v>

7
00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:22.280
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no different from what we're trying</v>

8
00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:26.000
<v Speaker 2>to do with web search and it will show</v>
<v Speaker 2>headlines or snippets or sometimes just</v>

9
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.490
<v Speaker 2>the source named itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when people want to read that</v>

10
00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:30.020
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we send them directly after the</v>

11
00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:31.130
<v Speaker 2>publisher's site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

12
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a given month,</v>

13
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:35.240
<v Speaker 2>just from Google news alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even talking about Google,</v>

14
00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 2>the broader search index,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

15
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.120
<v Speaker 2>we send about a billion clicks every</v>
<v Speaker 2>single month.</v>

16
00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:42.170
<v Speaker 2>The publishers worldwide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I mean,</v>

17
00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really consistent with what we're</v>

18
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:44.840
<v Speaker 2>trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have content,</v>

19
00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:47.480
<v Speaker 2>we don't have any editors and</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists creating stories.</v>

20
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just trying to surface that great</v>

21
00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:50.820
<v Speaker 2>content that people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

22
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:54.170
<v Speaker 2>are creating every single day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's traditional sources that</v>

23
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:57.130
<v Speaker 2>have been around for hundreds of years</v>
<v Speaker 2>or are new startups that are,</v>

24
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are just fresh to the market.</v>

25
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have no intention of,</v>

26
00:01:05.261 --> 00:01:05.940
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

27
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.920
<v Speaker 2>pain simply for indexing a information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

28
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think sometimes there is a perception</v>

29
00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:15.070
<v Speaker 2>that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an either or proposition that I can</v>

30
00:01:15.071 --> 00:01:17.350
<v Speaker 2>put my content on the web and make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>freely available,</v>

31
00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:19.270
<v Speaker 2>but if I decide to put up a paywall it</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't be,</v>

32
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I can't make it discoverable and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the case.</v>

33
00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:24.910
<v Speaker 2>And actually publishers who decided to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put up a paywall,</v>

34
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can still be discovered within Google at</v>

35
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street Journal is actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a perfect example of that.</v>

36
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

37
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

38
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.260
<v Speaker 2>since they'd been on the web,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've always had at least some set of</v>

39
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:39.100
<v Speaker 2>their content behind a paywall and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've charged subscribers for that and</v>

40
00:01:39.101 --> 00:01:40.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that content has been available</v>

41
00:01:40.871 --> 00:01:44.230
<v Speaker 2>within google news and also within</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google search as well.</v>

42
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.040
<v Speaker 2>So there are opportunities for</v>
<v Speaker 2>publishers if they decide that they feel</v>

43
00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:51.430
<v Speaker 2>that they can charge for that content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>users are willing to pay for that,</v>

44
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.370
<v Speaker 2>they can do that and still decide that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to be discovered within</v>

45
00:01:54.371 --> 00:01:55.580
<v Speaker 2>google.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a,</v>

46
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

47
00:01:56.721 --> 00:01:58.770
<v Speaker 2>there are a number of different options</v>
<v Speaker 2>of how they can do so.</v>

48
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it has to be an either or</v>

49
00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:04.520
<v Speaker 2>proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be a worse thing for,</v>

50
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.580
<v Speaker 2>for the end user if there are certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>searches,</v>

51
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 2>return certain information and other</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones didn't.</v>

52
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a publisher can decide how much</v>

53
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:13.370
<v Speaker 2>access they want to give for different</v>
<v Speaker 2>search engines and,</v>

54
00:02:13.371 --> 00:02:16.360
<v Speaker 2>and do that fairly easily with just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple bit of code on their pages.</v>

55
00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Right now.</v>
