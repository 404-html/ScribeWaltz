1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Early on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seemed as if Muhammad's ambition was</v>

2
00:00:02.991 --> 00:00:07.190
<v Speaker 1>simply to go from door to door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from passion to person and say,</v>

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave alone what you believe in.</v>

4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Believe in the one God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one who spoke to me through the</v>

5
00:00:14.301 --> 00:00:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Angel Jubril.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you say it in Arabic and</v>

6
00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:22.781
<v Speaker 1>Gabrielle in English</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then extort people to do certain</v>

7
00:00:24.171 --> 00:00:28.610
<v Speaker 1>things that in the 21st century we</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand has religion,</v>

8
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.910
<v Speaker 1>prayer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fasting congregations,</v>

9
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the first 10 years in Mecca,</v>

10
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.010
<v Speaker 1>I would say largely harmless.</v>

11
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.920
<v Speaker 1>There's that Mohammed and in a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern way,</v>

12
00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:50.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know Dr Jekyll and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Hyde,</v>

13
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 1>but you could understand him as a doctor</v>
<v Speaker 1>checkup.</v>

14
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Then he goes to Medina and then you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mr hired side of Mohammed.</v>

15
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly there's a militia and now he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a politician.</v>

16
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.260
<v Speaker 1>He's not only preaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please come to the one God is demanding,</v>

17
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.310
<v Speaker 1>come to the one God and accept me as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>profit and if not,</v>

18
00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:17.311
<v Speaker 1>I declare war and he declares war and</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a relatively small militia,</v>

19
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.330
<v Speaker 1>at least according to the Islamic</v>
<v Speaker 1>perception this is,</v>

20
00:01:22.331 --> 00:01:27.331
<v Speaker 1>these are other Muslim documents with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively small militia or a small</v>

21
00:01:29.831 --> 00:01:34.180
<v Speaker 1>number of men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he defeats a much larger,</v>

22
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>much more well established army and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>victory leads to another victory and it</v>

23
00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:44.170
<v Speaker 1>leads to another victory to another</v>
<v Speaker 1>victory.</v>

24
00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:48.220
<v Speaker 1>But it also leads to complexities</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the more he gains power,</v>

25
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>he has a say over more people and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>then leads to the necessity of</v>

26
00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:55.534
<v Speaker 1>legislation.</v>

27
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.780
<v Speaker 1>In hindsight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in the 21st century,</v>

28
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.650
<v Speaker 1>you are a political scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sociologist or psychologist,</v>

29
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.020
<v Speaker 1>historian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of social scientist,</v>

30
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.830
<v Speaker 1>you look back in that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you agreed that matter to you will be</v>

31
00:02:08.831 --> 00:02:10.360
<v Speaker 1>impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see goodness.</v>

32
00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:13.930
<v Speaker 1>This man was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He defeated large armies,</v>

33
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.780
<v Speaker 1>he established an empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he legislator,</v>

34
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.990
<v Speaker 1>he kept them together and he left a</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative behind that lasted many</v>

35
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.550
<v Speaker 1>centuries well beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was born wonderful.</v>

36
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't argue with that.</v>

37
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he also did was he froze his</v>

38
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.930
<v Speaker 1>innovation in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the last prophet.</v>

39
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Nobody else could come and innovate on</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he said.</v>

40
00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:44.290
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he declares innovation,</v>

41
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.980
<v Speaker 1>the biggest sin that I believe I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>commit,</v>

42
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.880
<v Speaker 1>thus the fate of the heretics of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

43
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.080
<v Speaker 1>And so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take Muhammad's as the Steve Jobs</v>

44
00:02:58.121 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seventh century,</v>

45
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I want you to imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to think of a steve jobs</v>

46
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>leaving a legacy behind where he says</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can never end.</v>

47
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>You may never change the minute he finds</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself on his deathbed,</v>

48
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.930
<v Speaker 1>never change</v>
<v Speaker 1>the iphone four or the IPAD air,</v>

49
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>I forget which condition these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>were back then or the mark.</v>

50
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>So that's Tim Cook would never have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would only have one thing which would</v>

51
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:37.201
<v Speaker 1>be to continue it and to say these are</v>
<v Speaker 1>timeless and that's pretty much what</v>

52
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Koran is a timeless document.</v>

53
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.750
<v Speaker 1>His example is rendered timeless and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that is a disservice that Mohammed</v>

54
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 1>did to his own innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His great achievement was the fact that</v>

55
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:53.810
<v Speaker 1>he managed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

56
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that narrative,</v>

57
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:57.040
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that narrative is a contested narrative,</v>

58
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>but if that narrative is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his greatest innovation was to unite the</v>

59
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Arabs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them transcend themselves,</v>

60
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.220
<v Speaker 1>unites into a super tribe and conquer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the biggest mistake he then made</v>

61
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.040
<v Speaker 1>would be to freeze things in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is the curse of Islam.</v>

62
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:23.041
<v Speaker 1>Is this</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that innovation is a sin,</v>

63
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 1>innovation is a bad thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They close the gates freezer.</v>

64
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 1>That is the curse of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the firewall to Islamic thinking.</v>

65
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>And we can see the result in everyday</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

66
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I repeat.</v>

67
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a perception of the people who put</v>
<v Speaker 1>these beliefs into practice.</v>

68
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 1>What really happened is still a massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>study.</v>

69
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
