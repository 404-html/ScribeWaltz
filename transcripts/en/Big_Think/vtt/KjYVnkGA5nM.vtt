00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.970
<v Speaker 1>We need to save for our future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country's becoming prosperous,</v>

2
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.330
<v Speaker 1>need to share their prosperity with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their citizens and let them spend that.</v>

3
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:17.780
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

4
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.170
<v Speaker 1>consumes less than 40 percent of its GNP</v>
<v Speaker 1>is hardly a is hardly appropriate.</v>

5
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.040
<v Speaker 1>We need to find the fora that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>connect not a limited set of aging</v>

6
00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:36.590
<v Speaker 1>societies dominated by the Atlantic</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ocean,</v>

7
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.220
<v Speaker 1>but a much wider set of rapidly emerging</v>
<v Speaker 1>societies to provide the function of</v>

8
00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>being a kind of global steering</v>
<v Speaker 1>committee.</v>

9
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.730
<v Speaker 1>As we address a central,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a global concerns,</v>

10
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.030
<v Speaker 1>we need to find ways in the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States to support a more inclusive</v>

11
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.140
<v Speaker 1>democracy in a more inclusive</v>
<v Speaker 1>prosperity.</v>

12
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.560
<v Speaker 1>If our people are going to be willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>accept the kind of international role</v>

13
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:13.571
<v Speaker 1>that the United States needs to take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the world is going to remain stable.</v>

14
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Some of that goes to healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of that goes to a that the tax</v>

15
00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:23.771
<v Speaker 1>system and a much much else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to forge some kind of</v>

16
00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:31.841
<v Speaker 1>international approach to dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are really the existential threats</v>

17
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.990
<v Speaker 1>around nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nuclear proliferation around global</v>

18
00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:39.440
<v Speaker 1>warming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two events that have the chance to</v>

19
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker 1>profoundly change the terms of life on</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth 50 or 100 years,</v>

20
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
