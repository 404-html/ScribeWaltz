00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I think one huge mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gay community and I think of the</v>

2
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:17.181
<v Speaker 1>American community as a whole has made</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that HIV is a treatable disease and</v>

3
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 1>thus contracting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a nonissue.</v>

4
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.610
<v Speaker 1>And while that may it be the case in</v>
<v Speaker 1>many a HIV positive,</v>

5
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>people live long and quote unquote</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy lives,</v>

6
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cost and trauma to that person in</v>

7
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>the family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't think anybody would</v>

8
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily want to sign up for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>I think there are institutions and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

10
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do credit and MTV,</v>

11
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>which I have plenty of problems about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will give them Kudos for raising</v>

12
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>awareness about HIV and getting tested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

13
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a huge part of that equation</v>

14
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 1>missing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do when you get tested?</v>

15
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.720
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing to walk into a free</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinic and have your blood drawn.</v>

16
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 1>It's another thing for you to be told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the results that you're positive.</v>

17
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.080
<v Speaker 1>And then there are zero marketing</v>
<v Speaker 1>messages about what goes on there.</v>

18
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's a huge dilemma</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting people tested is the first</v>

19
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:14.994
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost as if that,</v>

21
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>that whole possibility has been ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think,</v>

22
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>especially in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

23
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did the use of crystal Meth,</v>

24
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>

25
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.690
<v Speaker 1>is resurging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>among young people and that leads to</v>
<v Speaker 1>plenty of unprotected sex.</v>

27
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.100
<v Speaker 1>And I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:38.130
<v Speaker 1>this carefree lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

29
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:43.131
<v Speaker 1>I think it's up to each individual to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really make that call and to protect</v>

30
00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:45.870
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are so many industries out</v>

31
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>there that can lend a helping hand.</v>
