00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I have followed baseball my life or</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive life,</v>

2
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.950
<v Speaker 1>and it really is a fun sport and to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baseball hall of fame as the</v>

3
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 1>greatest hall of fame there is period</v>
<v Speaker 1>into paragraph,</v>

4
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.150
<v Speaker 1>so I wanted to write about it and wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do a book and oversized</v>

5
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.820
<v Speaker 1>coffee table book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing a line from one of the seinfeld</v>

6
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It even comes with four legs in case you</v>

7
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 1>need a coffee table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Book,</v>

8
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Big Pictorial history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing the history and I'm taking</v>

9
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:45.081
<v Speaker 1>the reader on a virtual tour through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hall of fame and I am proud of the fact</v>

10
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>that I got a blurb on the back from Yogi</v>
<v Speaker 1>Berra,</v>

11
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>which reads what Bert sugar doesn't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about baseball.</v>

12
00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what that means.</v>

13
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Zen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might like,</v>

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not worth knowing,</v>

15
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>but Yogi makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Yogi is.</v>

16
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 1>But Yogi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I once asked you,</v>

17
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yolks.</v>

18
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>What did you mean when you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you come to a fork in the road,</v>

19
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

20
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live.</v>

21
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>I live at the end of a circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you go left to right,</v>

22
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:25.221
<v Speaker 1>you come to my driveway and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's making sense and if you parse</v>

23
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>analyze yogi sayings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does make sense.</v>

24
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>He's credited with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too crowded.</v>

25
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Nobody goes there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a story there that the Yankees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after a night game,</v>

27
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>we'll go out to dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be at the stadium early to either</v>

28
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.960
<v Speaker 1>go through the lineup of the opposing</v>
<v Speaker 1>team or get treated for some ailment or</v>

29
00:01:51.301 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>wrapped their knees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was mickey mantle or whatever</v>

30
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>and after the game they'd all go out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner and there was this one restaurant</v>

31
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 1>in Cleveland that always was open and</v>
<v Speaker 1>always had a place for him after a game</v>

32
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>and they all went there when it became</v>
<v Speaker 1>known that the Yankees eat here,</v>

33
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.870
<v Speaker 1>no advertising or word of mouth and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>went one time and there was no place at</v>

34
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:20.781
<v Speaker 1>the end for them so they didn't go there</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore or go.</v>

35
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.570
<v Speaker 1>It's too crowded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody goes there anymore.</v>

36
00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Meaning us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yogi makes sense.</v>

37
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think steroids are as big</v>
<v Speaker 1>a problem as the presses made them,</v>

38
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.610
<v Speaker 1>and if they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a picture on steroids.</v>

39
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Throwing to a batter on steroids is</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting to a field or on steroids.</v>

40
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking for not one upsmanship.</v>

41
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Tony Gwen will tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago the padres used to have a bowl</v>

42
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:53.210
<v Speaker 1>of Ben Fetterman's and their clubhouse</v>
<v Speaker 1>like m's.</v>

43
00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:56.730
<v Speaker 1>You pop them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't help the padres at all.</v>

44
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>And I've talented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ain't gonna help nothing.</v>

45
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Your talent am I getting be a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>edge,</v>

46
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>but so will a spit ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baseball was always dealt in edges.</v>

47
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>The phillies used to raise their third</v>
<v Speaker 1>base,</v>

48
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>foul line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extra lime.</v>

49
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>So that Richie Ashwyn's bunks with state</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

50
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>the Cleveland Indians used to grow the</v>
<v Speaker 1>grass higher at third base.</v>

51
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>So Al Rosen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the third baseman wouldn't break his,</v>

52
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>his nose or his fingers on every ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball.</v>

53
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 1>It would slow it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 62 playoffs between the dodgers</v>

54
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>and the giants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By that time,</v>

55
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles dodgers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco giants,</v>

56
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 1>they ordered the base pass so maury</v>
<v Speaker 1>wills couldn't get off to a fast start</v>

57
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 1>and steel basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's illegal.</v>

58
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Steroids aren't I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

59
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.980
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

60
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't get that excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

61
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm so old that when I heard the</v>

62
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 1>word drugs the first time I thought they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about aspirin.</v>
