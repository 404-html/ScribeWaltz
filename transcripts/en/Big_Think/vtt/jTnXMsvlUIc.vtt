00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>I hope it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it comes out,</v>

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensely.</v>

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not to say that it's about me,</v>

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conducting is obviously a visual</v>

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 1>activity because it's about showing</v>
<v Speaker 1>things with your gesture to the</v>

7
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.760
<v Speaker 1>musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't want the audience to feel</v>

8
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>that they have to see a show from me in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to,</v>

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>to feel how exciting that the music is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.900
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the music is exciting and if I look</v>

11
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:38.901
<v Speaker 1>unengaged and not not in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that would certainly prevent the</v>

12
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>experience from being what it really</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>

13
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:45.771
<v Speaker 1>So it's a fine line that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of walk to,</v>

14
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.490
<v Speaker 1>to really infuse the performance and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>music with your deeply committed</v>

15
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:57.300
<v Speaker 1>personality while allowing the music to</v>
<v Speaker 1>still be paramount.</v>

16
00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tricky thing and that's,</v>

17
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're all all going for.</v>

18
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

19
00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:06.771
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:10.760
<v Speaker 1>you have to allow your face to show the</v>
<v Speaker 1>show the character of the music.</v>

21
00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:13.730
<v Speaker 1>But that's not something that I plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:13.731 --> 00:01:15.050
<v Speaker 1>it's like you don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

23
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:17.480
<v Speaker 1>well I want them to think I'm happy so</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll smile now.</v>

24
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're naturally allow yourself to feel</v>

25
00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:22.340
<v Speaker 1>the music and then just as you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:24.020
<v Speaker 1>when you're hanging out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:26.450
<v Speaker 1>sometimes your face looks more serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it looks more animated,</v>

28
00:01:26.451 --> 00:01:28.160
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it looks more pensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

29
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.720
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely part of the</v>

30
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:34.721
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens right away actually are.</v>

31
00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it doesn't,</v>

32
00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:39.350
<v Speaker 1>then there's probably something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.930
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

34
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.810
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can really understand the difference</v>

35
00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:46.090
<v Speaker 1>in orchestra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.690
<v Speaker 1>feels and conductors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to a conducting class where</v>

37
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>there may be six or 10 or 12 conductors</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a very short span of time,</v>

38
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.960
<v Speaker 1>often it happens that these conductors</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be doing the same music.</v>

39
00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:01.000
<v Speaker 1>So you have a really good basis of</v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison.</v>

40
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Speaker 1>The sound is literally different within</v>
<v Speaker 1>one second of instantly,</v>

41
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.600
<v Speaker 1>once a new conductor comes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll conduct the same music that had</v>

42
00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:13.690
<v Speaker 1>just been done by another conductor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The orchestra sounds completely</v>

43
00:02:13.691 --> 00:02:14.800
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's uncanny.</v>

44
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.670
<v Speaker 1>There's something in the body language</v>
<v Speaker 1>that immediately translates into sound.</v>

45
00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:19.504
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the exciting and kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.430
<v Speaker 2>amazing things about conducting.</v>
