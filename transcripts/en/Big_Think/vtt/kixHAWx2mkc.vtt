1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Unpassionate about positive thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the early books written the power</v>

2
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 1>of positive thinking and all the experts</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past.</v>

3
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew them later on in life,</v>

4
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 1>met them in different parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.870
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I apply it because if you study any of</v>

6
00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>the writings and the tissues of positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a goal in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you're thinking blindly.</v>

8
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't walk in and you don't walk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a destination without having an idea of</v>

9
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:32.850
<v Speaker 1>what you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're going.</v>

10
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's positive thinking isn't just</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking to yourself,</v>

11
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do anything I want and so forth</v>

12
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.460
<v Speaker 1>because some things we can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

13
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>I have some people I know personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish they felt they could float if</v>

14
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>they walked out of an airplane in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sky.</v>

15
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being nasty.</v>

16
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm just being crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the real positive thinking is having</v>

17
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:57.891
<v Speaker 1>goals because a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a golfer never hits a ball and so he</v>

18
00:00:58.031 --> 00:00:58.930
<v Speaker 1>sees where it's going.</v>

19
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Never hits a ball and police sees words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it's going.</v>

20
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Neither does a picture when he throws a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball.</v>

21
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>So we have to have in our lives some</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction and we have to think with,</v>

22
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.610
<v Speaker 1>with the positiveness that we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take advantage of all the</v>

23
00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:18.490
<v Speaker 1>opportunities that lead to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

24
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>But the interesting thing is when</v>
<v Speaker 1>failures take place and study the lives</v>

25
00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:28.600
<v Speaker 1>of famous people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found alternative routes which</v>

26
00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>often caused them to invent new</v>
<v Speaker 1>machinery,</v>

27
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 1>new paraphernalia that didn't work when</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing failed because they had</v>

28
00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:40.360
<v Speaker 1>to be resourceful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same as you are in a war.</v>

29
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:43.090
<v Speaker 1>When you're playing a game in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're playing against a team and</v>

30
00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:45.160
<v Speaker 1>something goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>

31
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Life is really a game show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

32
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.690
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a flexibility and those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things take place.</v>

33
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.330
<v Speaker 1>Not only in knowing in your heart and</v>
<v Speaker 1>soul,</v>

34
00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:58.060
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find a route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to find the root to this</v>

35
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.600
<v Speaker 1>place you want to go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's working in a,</v>

36
00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:02.480
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:07.481
<v Speaker 1>a large food complex because you like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>cook and what have you and your say food</v>

38
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.200
<v Speaker 1>or whether it's working on a sports team</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what have you.</v>

39
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.420
<v Speaker 1>But you also have to figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:16.210
<v Speaker 1>if this thing doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something in the</v>

41
00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:19.930
<v Speaker 1>background there that I didn't notice</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I could take advantage of in the</v>

42
00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:23.680
<v Speaker 1>same way that sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's take a lesson from chefs.</v>

43
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.580
<v Speaker 1>If they don't have a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece,</v>

44
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 1>a certain appetizer that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's there for that food,</v>

45
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>there's often a couple of other ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be edit that turns out,</v>

46
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:41.580
<v Speaker 1>can make it a new chased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new dessert.</v>

47
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's the way you have to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about like as a meal at your adding to.</v>
