1
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Relations in the United States today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marvelously complicated question.</v>

2
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an article in the Washington</v>

3
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Post today about some of Obama's workers</v>
<v Speaker 1>being</v>

4
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.480
<v Speaker 1>disturbed or more than disturb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrified by some of the racial</v>

5
00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>responses they'd had when they go ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to vote for Obama.</v>

6
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Speaker 1>So race in America is certainly better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than it's ever been.</v>

7
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that racism of unsorted</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another is curable.</v>

8
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it's always something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>there for people who need it to use it.</v>

9
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's racism,</v>

10
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:50.470
<v Speaker 1>antisemitism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Annika,</v>

11
00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:55.471
<v Speaker 1>fallacy ism and a immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people for whom that will</v>

12
00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>always give them some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustenance.</v>

13
00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.660
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the problem is that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>think we can do away with that and we</v>

15
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think also the part of the problem</v>

16
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>is that we ask ourselves to cure</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

17
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there are still elements of</v>

18
00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:19.200
<v Speaker 1>racism and anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone,</v>

19
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much they believe they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome it,</v>

20
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>it's still there.</v>

21
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>And to make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to kid yourself and think that</v>

22
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:33.411
<v Speaker 1>it's not is makes it harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important to recognize that</v>

23
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:40.131
<v Speaker 1>human beings tend to think in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a binomial way.</v>

24
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 1>We think yes or no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think good or bad.</v>

25
00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>We think black or white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's in our minds,</v>

26
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:49.970
<v Speaker 1>that's the structure of our minds and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

27
00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>we have to struggle against it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can't pretend that it's not</v>

28
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think sometimes we ask people to</v>

29
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.930
<v Speaker 1>get to shed that from themselves to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

30
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.940
<v Speaker 1>to free them from it and people can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>

31
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>It's part of our mental structure and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's very crucial that people</v>

32
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:14.130
<v Speaker 1>recognize no it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that other people have,</v>

33
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:14.964
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

34
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Speaker 1>it's the way our minds are constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our mindset.</v>

35
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.220
<v Speaker 1>It may have to do with something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>computers who the on off through our</v>

36
00:02:29.221 --> 00:02:31.630
<v Speaker 1>electrons work the same way in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

37
00:02:31.631 --> 00:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>They're either clicking on or clicking</v>
<v Speaker 1>off and we tent.</v>

38
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>That's the way we work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think the first thing we think is a,</v>

39
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a yes or no answer,</v>

40
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.140
<v Speaker 1>a two sided answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we learned that in fact there</v>

41
00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:49.200
<v Speaker 1>are many two sided answers in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those things,</v>

42
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:51.600
<v Speaker 1>that it isn't black or white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are graze.</v>

43
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>It isn't good or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are things in the middle that</v>

44
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 1>temper that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as long as we pretend that we can</v>

45
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:03.890
<v Speaker 1>overcome that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it causes us more green.</v>

46
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.060
<v Speaker 1>So long concert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that question,</v>

47
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.190
<v Speaker 1>how does one identify?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think primarily the primary</v>

48
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:25.411
<v Speaker 1>identity is that we're members of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same species and that that that's</v>

49
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:31.501
<v Speaker 1>absolutely crucial to us that our future</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on our realization that we're</v>

50
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.010
<v Speaker 1>part of the same species and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else is subservient to that.</v>

51
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.040
<v Speaker 1>As long as we think of ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily as American or French or or</v>

52
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever Iraqi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to continue to divide and</v>

53
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:53.570
<v Speaker 1>continued to find conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the,</v>

54
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hope is the great,</v>

55
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>I've been reading a lot about</v>
<v Speaker 1>globalization,</v>

56
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.260
<v Speaker 1>not just globalization as commerce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but global globalization as concept of</v>

57
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>the way human beings had been</v>
<v Speaker 1>globalizing ever since history began.</v>

58
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Before history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we came out of Africa and spread over</v>

59
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the first globalization.</v>

60
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.150
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

61
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>the kind of globalization we have now</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's communication,</v>

62
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.780
<v Speaker 1>did intimate communication between</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody in the world might be what's</v>

63
00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:29.880
<v Speaker 1>going to save us from our batteries.</v>

64
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
