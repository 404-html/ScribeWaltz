1
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 1>It's funny cause I was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this with a woman named Amy Aright,</v>

2
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.020
<v Speaker 1>who was one of the co founders of e</v>
<v Speaker 1>trade and,</v>

3
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Olivia cruises the other day.</v>

4
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:20.930
<v Speaker 1>We were on a panel together at a gay Mba</v>
<v Speaker 1>conference and we were talking a little</v>

5
00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:23.120
<v Speaker 1>bit about what it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to be an entrepreneur</v>

6
00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:26.510
<v Speaker 1>and what are the challenges?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And both of us sort of asserted that</v>

7
00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:29.330
<v Speaker 1>there really weren't any as far as we</v>
<v Speaker 1>could tell.</v>

8
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.030
<v Speaker 1>And principally I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.840
<v Speaker 1>there's still a ton of homophobia in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and there's a ton of homophobia in</v>

10
00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:39.950
<v Speaker 1>the business world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because I've been very out and very</v>

11
00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:43.100
<v Speaker 1>explicitly out in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in my professional life from the</v>

12
00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:44.360
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't hear it.</v>

13
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.230
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't like me because I'm gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you don't want to do business with me</v>

14
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:50.330
<v Speaker 1>because I'm gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I probably just don't even know</v>

15
00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:52.250
<v Speaker 1>that because you're just steering clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>of me.</v>

16
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's when you're closeted and people</v>

17
00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:57.980
<v Speaker 1>don't know that you're gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you hear and see the things that</v>

18
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.930
<v Speaker 1>are otherwise unsavory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

19
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.770
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily want to change</v>

20
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:07.100
<v Speaker 1>everybody's mind in the world about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about homosexuality or Judaism is I'm a</v>

22
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Jew and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

23
00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:13.790
<v Speaker 1>any of the things that I'm passionate</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

24
00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:16.400
<v Speaker 1>but I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is I do want to be in an environment</v>

25
00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:19.730
<v Speaker 1>in which I'm respected and I have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>equal opportunity to be successful.</v>

26
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.750
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm creating that every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>day by putting my parameters out there</v>

27
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 1>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is who I am.</v>

28
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish,</v>

29
00:01:26.451 --> 00:01:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Chubby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now in my mid thirties,</v>

31
00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 1>this is who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

32
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:33.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you can self select out of my world</v>

33
00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:35.030
<v Speaker 1>if you'd like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

34
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.800
<v Speaker 1>so be it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the,</v>

35
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.860
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the challenges for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay professional people is this idea</v>

36
00:01:42.771 --> 00:01:44.060
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

37
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.260
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be faced with a world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hostile to you and your lifestyle</v>

38
00:01:48.261 --> 00:01:49.880
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.040
<v Speaker 1>but really it ends up being more</v>
<v Speaker 1>quotidian than that.</v>

40
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.990
<v Speaker 1>I think when you've worked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the corporate world,</v>

41
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:56.630
<v Speaker 1>which I mostly issued in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my professional career.</v>

42
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.190
<v Speaker 1>But when you're working in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional world,</v>

43
00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 1>most of that hassle factor of being gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you,</v>

44
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Monday morning you come into the</v>

45
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>office and your friends are talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about their kids and their,</v>

46
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their spouse and what they did for the</v>

47
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.690
<v Speaker 1>weekend and the golfing that they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if your lifestyle is not those</v>

48
00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:13.880
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not a gay person with kids and</v>

49
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:18.881
<v Speaker 1>a spouse and golfing and you're sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>forced to like interpret what part of</v>

50
00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:22.760
<v Speaker 1>your life the other person does or</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to hear and what's</v>

51
00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:26.570
<v Speaker 1>contextually relevant and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is or isn't going to make them</v>

52
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:28.250
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

53
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's actually a complicated</v>

54
00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:31.570
<v Speaker 1>dance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

55
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.810
<v Speaker 1>at first and then over time what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize is you gain traction on that.</v>

56
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.950
<v Speaker 1>So not being pollyanna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am saying that I think single straight</v>

57
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:43.040
<v Speaker 1>people have some of the same issues in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture where,</v>

58
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ran a lot of married people are</v>

59
00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:45.710
<v Speaker 1>married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people with children.</v>

60
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.780
<v Speaker 1>There's a sort of expectation often</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

61
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are married with children can</v>

62
00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:52.820
<v Speaker 1>go home at four o'clock because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to attend to their kids.</v>

63
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:53.750
<v Speaker 1>And of course who would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

64
00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:55.640
<v Speaker 1>you can't go pick your kids up from</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

65
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're as the single person or the person</v>

66
00:02:57.501 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>without kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get to do things.</v>

67
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I think it's more,</v>

68
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 1>I would like a family status equality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairness issue than it is a sexuality</v>

69
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>fairness and equality issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of,</v>

70
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 1>so to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my observation has been that most issues</v>

71
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>related to sexuality in the workplace</v>
<v Speaker 1>are actually issues of family status and</v>

72
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>gender and rather than sexuality</v>
<v Speaker 1>strictly speaking.</v>

73
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

74
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>once you put those things into context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's a layer of certainly of</v>

75
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>like explicitly sexuality related</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

76
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of it is about family status</v>

77
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>and gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will say one thing though,</v>

78
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 1>which is I have the benefit of being an</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur and,</v>

79
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the benefit of living in,</v>

80
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the technology business and the games</v>

81
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>industry and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being an entrepreneur in those</v>

82
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in those,</v>

83
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.650
<v Speaker 1>in the context of entrepreneurship and</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and,</v>

84
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.800
<v Speaker 1>and the games industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

85
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>of course I can be out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

86
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>it's my company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in that way I can build a corporate</v>

87
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 1>culture that matches the environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I want to work in and are built</v>

88
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 1>with people who I respect and who</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect me and who I feel comfortable</v>

89
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>with and with whom I want to come into</v>
<v Speaker 1>work every single day and enjoy the,</v>

90
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically the relationship that I'm</v>

91
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 1>building with them.</v>

92
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a degree of control that I</v>

93
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>don't have in many other aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being an entrepreneur.</v>

94
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>But I certainly do in terms of who gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>hired to work at my company.</v>

95
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

96
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely one thing that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rewarding about being an entrepreneur</v>

97
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>that you don't necessarily get when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>work in the corporate world.</v>

98
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 1>So I appreciate it if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're just starting out in your</v>

100
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:31.510
<v Speaker 1>career and you want to go work at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:36.280
<v Speaker 1>some big tech finance company or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Department of defense or something crazy</v>

102
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:38.230
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your considerations are probably</v>

103
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:39.700
<v Speaker 1>different from mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

104
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I try to live a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work so much.</v>

105
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>I try to integrate my life as much as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible so that I can enjoy all aspects</v>

106
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
