1
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.820
<v Speaker 1>To</v>
<v Speaker 1>the infrastructure</v>

2
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.550
<v Speaker 2>sector,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's our greatest need.</v>

3
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 2>We plan to invest and this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative estimate,</v>

4
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.480
<v Speaker 2>$300,000,000,000 in the next few years</v>
<v Speaker 2>into infrastructure.</v>

5
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.860
<v Speaker 2>This will go into roads and airports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the railways,</v>

6
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 2>into ports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would say to anybody going into</v>

7
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.670
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the need is there,</v>

8
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.330
<v Speaker 2>it's recognized a lot of projects that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have already been prepared.</v>

9
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.850
<v Speaker 2>The government is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

10
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 2>a organizing mega power projects in</v>
<v Speaker 2>which all the preliminary work will have</v>

11
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.510
<v Speaker 2>been done by government of India itself</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the state government.</v>

12
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.440
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as you go in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can start putting up the power plant</v>

13
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.150
<v Speaker 2>and we are an energy short country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are short of a lot of power.</v>

14
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.100
<v Speaker 2>And in order to sustain this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>regional growth infrastructure is going</v>

15
00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 2>to be the greatest challenge</v>

16
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the most interesting</v>

17
00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:13.900
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

18
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Indian entrepreneurship or you have of</v>
<v Speaker 2>course a lot of very highly recognizable</v>

19
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.860
<v Speaker 2>names of Indian origin entrepreneurs in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States itself.</v>

20
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the head of Pepsi Co is an Indian woman</v>

21
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.150
<v Speaker 2>in the head of the new head of Citi</v>
<v Speaker 2>Group.</v>

<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

25
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.380
<v Speaker 2>I was an Indian origin person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raj Gupta.</v>

26
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.840
<v Speaker 2>These are examples really of Indians who</v>
<v Speaker 2>have benefited from the fine American</v>

27
00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:54.481
<v Speaker 2>education and have had the opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 2>but have grasped the opportunity to rise</v>

28
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.970
<v Speaker 2>on the Indian side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

29
00:01:57.971 --> 00:02:02.971
<v Speaker 2>we have a number of groups which have</v>
<v Speaker 2>grown tremendously.</v>

30
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Daughters is possibly the most well</v>
<v Speaker 2>known,</v>

31
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.280
<v Speaker 2>but also in forces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wipro,</v>

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.800
<v Speaker 2>the powdered forge group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bobby Lloyd,</v>

33
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in fact,</v>

34
00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:23.701
<v Speaker 2>if you looked at India and you look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the companies that are now our top 2015</v>

35
00:02:24.761 --> 00:02:28.060
<v Speaker 2>of them didn't exist 15 years ago or 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

36
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.330

<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurs and an interest.</v>

37
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.890

<v Speaker 2>in the family owned businesses in India,</v>

38
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 2>we now have the second generation who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in to take over and run these</v>

39
00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:50.110
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of them have had,</v>

40
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been to business schools in the United</v>

<v Speaker 2>States or in India and they are running</v>
<v Speaker 2>their business operations</v>
