00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a witness protection</v>
<v Speaker 1>program?</v>

2
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Can you provide me with a couple of big</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys?</v>

3
00:00:14.091 --> 00:00:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I can keep an eye on me after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.380
<v Speaker 1>I honestly don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one has to say honestly that for</v>

6
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.440
<v Speaker 1>anyone to go into the poetry business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one has to respect the fact that they're</v>

7
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:32.210
<v Speaker 1>trying to do at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.790
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just,</v>

9
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:38.390
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be interested in,</v>

10
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm mean,</v>

11
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.170
<v Speaker 1>apart from the fact that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

12
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.570
<v Speaker 1>it would not be politically smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have someone who has a certain,</v>

13
00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an editor of the New Yorker,</v>

14
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.310
<v Speaker 1>probably inappropriate for me to say I</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit so and so.</v>

15
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.190
<v Speaker 1>The fact of the matter is that there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one I had.</v>

16
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm really open to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really open to the possibility that</v>

17
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.070
<v Speaker 1>a great poem will come down the pike</v>
<v Speaker 1>from anywhere.</v>

18
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.130
<v Speaker 1>I really am innocent and it's at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fact of life that they do,</v>

19
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.340
<v Speaker 1>that they do and it's a fact of life</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

20
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.800
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writers,</v>

21
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who often may not have been able to,</v>

22
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce simply adding work.</v>

23
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Actually one day will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.150
<v Speaker 1>so no one and that goes from students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one does not write off anyone and</v>

25
00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:42.080
<v Speaker 1>that's largely because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from anything else</v>

26
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>on a good day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideally it's not even they're doing,</v>

27
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not the doing of the person when</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only when the person I deeply,</v>

28
00:01:55.671 --> 00:02:00.671
<v Speaker 1>deeply believe only when the person has</v>
<v Speaker 1>given herself or himself over to the</v>

29
00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:06.821
<v Speaker 1>idea that they're in part and writing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>poem is actually quite small,</v>

30
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.810
<v Speaker 1>but they have to apply for something</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond themselves to happen.</v>

31
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.230
<v Speaker 1>And we know that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that experience from,</v>

32
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if we're reading a letter we wrote</v>

33
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.660
<v Speaker 1>six months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nevermind,</v>

34
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know a paper one road at college and you</v>

35
00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 1>look at it new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wrote that?</v>

36
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Did I write that now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't have,</v>

37
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.840
<v Speaker 1>couldn't have been me who wrote there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

38
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:35.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too smart.</v>

39
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:39.080
<v Speaker 1>It's too good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's due to flirt to whatever,</v>

40
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.160
<v Speaker 1>and it's that sense actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one is taken over by something</v>

41
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.910
<v Speaker 1>ideally that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:53.090
<v Speaker 1>that one must never lose sight of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

43
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:54.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

44
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

45
00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:58.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in poetry and many,</v>

46
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many manifestations,</v>

47
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>many manifestations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

48
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:07.340
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just thinking here,</v>

49
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

50
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be done too much.</v>
