00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.993
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.920
<v Speaker 1>there is already a lot of collaboration</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on between a European countries</v>

3
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>and China and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>between us and China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is necessary from so many</v>

5
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 1>different perspectives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.750
<v Speaker 1>China is part of the WTO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the major,</v>

7
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy gradually will be,</v>

8
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>and it's a sustainable development and</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate area.</v>

9
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.650
<v Speaker 1>It is essential for the global future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no doubt there has to be</v>

10
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Speaker 1>collaboration and China is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop.</v>

11
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.560
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have ambitions and uh,</v>

12
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>we have to realize that those ambitions</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not different from the ambitions</v>

13
00:00:58.021 --> 00:00:59.020
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 1>the dominated in our own countries when</v>
<v Speaker 1>our countries were being developed,</v>

15
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and new technologies were being put into</v>

16
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:11.070
<v Speaker 1>a function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

17
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:16.071
<v Speaker 1>so the best thing we can do is to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>collaborative and a secret that the</v>

18
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.130
<v Speaker 1>patterns that are used are inspired by</v>
<v Speaker 1>future technologies.</v>

19
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>And it will benefit all of us.</v>

20
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:26.934
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 1>being so afraid about competitiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have never understood,</v>

23
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>even as a prime minister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

24
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.370
<v Speaker 1>unless you have products or services to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell to others outside your own country,</v>

25
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 1>then you better look for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.980
<v Speaker 1>other things that you can do better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in a,</v>

27
00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:53.981
<v Speaker 1>in a world where we all benefit from</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing what we are best at doing and,</v>

28
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.350
<v Speaker 1>and use our minds and our efforts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>promote a development pattern that</v>

29
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>benefits all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this year,</v>

30
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>this drama about being so scared about</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else,</v>

31
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>I have never really taken onboard.</v>
