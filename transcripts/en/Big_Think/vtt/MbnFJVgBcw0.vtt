00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Young person you will find in your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes your great ambitions will</v>

2
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:12.321
<v Speaker 1>be momentarily stymied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forwarded marginalized by those who were</v>

3
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>perhaps luckier come from money where</v>
<v Speaker 1>more doors opened,</v>

4
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 1>where college was a given.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not a student loan.</v>

5
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.350
<v Speaker 1>It was something that dad paid for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To wear an ease and confidence in life</v>

6
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.390
<v Speaker 1>was almost a birthright where for you it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a very hard climb.</v>

7
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens all the time.</v>

8
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Some of the greatest Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the greatest thinkers,</v>

9
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>architects,</v>

10
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.460
<v Speaker 1>politicians and other movers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shakers and creators all over the world</v>

11
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.790
<v Speaker 1>have come from very meager beginnings</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my favorite American Abraham</v>

12
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so just because you come from</v>

13
00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must not let that be something that</v>

14
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:13.101
<v Speaker 1>holds you back and you will encounter</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who never have to pay in full.</v>

15
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>They get to wreck the room and never</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to clean it.</v>

16
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>They can get all the way through high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school and never understand where a</v>

17
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>dollar comes from because they just get</v>
<v Speaker 1>it given to them.</v>

18
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I went to school with guys like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've had presidents like that.</v>

19
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>You've had friends like that and you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've suffered,</v>

20
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.590
<v Speaker 1>your humility has been tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your patients has been tried,</v>

21
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>your resolve and your ambition has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried.</v>

22
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.830
<v Speaker 1>You cannot let these people make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel that you have in any way been</v>

23
00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:52.341
<v Speaker 1>dwarfed or outclassed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must really go for your own and</v>

24
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:56.070
<v Speaker 1>realize how short life is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got what you got,</v>

25
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>so you got to make the most of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really can't spend a whole lot of</v>

26
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:03.240
<v Speaker 1>time worrying about his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really have to go for your own.</v>

27
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>If you have an idea of what you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do in your future,</v>

28
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.700
<v Speaker 1>you must go at it with almost monastic</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsession.</v>

29
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Be It music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ballet or just a basic degree.</v>

30
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.370
<v Speaker 1>You have to go at it singlemindedly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>let nothing get in your way and that's</v>

31
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:27.420
<v Speaker 1>why you're young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you can survive on no sleep,</v>

32
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.780
<v Speaker 1>top ramen noodles and dental floss and</v>
<v Speaker 1>still look good and take advantage of</v>

33
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:35.131
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Create energy.</v>

34
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>You have the fact that you can do an all</v>
<v Speaker 1>nighter,</v>

35
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 1>all the people you admire from Muhammad</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ali to any politician,</v>

36
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>they work and work and work like Bill</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton.</v>

37
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone's favorite rhodes scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's smart for a reason.</v>

38
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 1>A got a great gift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great mind.</v>

39
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 1>But he sat and he shoved a whole bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>information in there and he learned how</v>

40
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>to connect the dots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so can you,</v>

41
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.020
<v Speaker 1>your president right now is a man who</v>
<v Speaker 1>got where he is through very hard work</v>

42
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 1>and scholarships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly hard work and application and</v>

43
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 1>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If these people can do it,</v>

44
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>why not you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is very,</v>

45
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>very easy though to feel smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to feel less than when you see sue,</v>

46
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.490
<v Speaker 1>see people with an advantage</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk where you struggle,</v>

47
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 1>who have ease of motion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you are constricted.</v>

48
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.720
<v Speaker 1>It can be a real shot to your morale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it can be flummoxing to a degree</v>

49
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>where you're almost paralytic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to keep picking yourself up and</v>

50
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:50.770
<v Speaker 1>reaching for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the long and short of it.</v>

51
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it won't get done.</v>
