00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.593
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it necessarily has value </v>

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:05.790
<v Speaker 1>for everyone then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not one of these people.</v>

3
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>He said you should get on twitter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody should have a twitter account.</v>

4
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:09.624
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you what's interesting about </v>

5
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:16.150
<v Speaker 1>it for me is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.123
<v Speaker 1>people can elect to follow writers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers and speakers they are </v>

7
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:27.360
<v Speaker 1>interested in and you can elect to </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow the back or not.</v>

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.973
<v Speaker 1>And so for me it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great way to build a network of </v>

9
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>people who are interested in my work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends of my ideas.</v>

10
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.383
<v Speaker 1>So that's what the people who follow me </v>
<v Speaker 1>on twitter or are there friends of my </v>

11
00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:43.671
<v Speaker 1>ideas and I can talk to them through </v>
<v Speaker 1>this network as they listened to me,</v>

12
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>but also a lot of other people at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

13
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:52.510
<v Speaker 1>So I have a small part in their feed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

14
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>which is fine because I'm one of many </v>
<v Speaker 1>voices at listening to.</v>

15
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.753
<v Speaker 1>So that's what twitter is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your own network of people who </v>

16
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>follow what you do and say,</v>

17
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.853
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

18
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.090
<v Speaker 1>well I'm learning twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in my first few months doing it.</v>

19
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.530
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm doing lots of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just help me understand,</v>

20
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the form and a lot of them are just,</v>

21
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probes.</v>

22
00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:22.490
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.013
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing around 10 green as it were with </v>

24
00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:27.660

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.650
<v Speaker 1>but I use it the way other people do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

26
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.973
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people I follow are constantly </v>

27
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:36.230
<v Speaker 1>posting links and ideas about stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to keep up with.</v>

28
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I find something that I think would</v>

29
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.990
<v Speaker 1>interest the kind of people who read my </v>
<v Speaker 1>blog or who follow my arguments,</v>

30
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.080
<v Speaker 1>I post it here something new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I post questions to my followers,</v>

31
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.520
<v Speaker 1>I push out news of my work as it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.553
<v Speaker 1>up here is around the web.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also get a kind of a real time </v>

33
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:05.120
<v Speaker 1>reaction to things going on in the news </v>
<v Speaker 1>that really interests me,</v>

34
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.983
<v Speaker 1>especially in the media is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the whole realm of alternative </v>

35
00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:11.594
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new media.</v>

36
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.980
<v Speaker 1>These are things that I follow with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>passion.</v>

37
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.240
<v Speaker 1>And so it's keeping me in touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's filtering the web for me.</v>

38
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.630
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.513
<v Speaker 1>reading the newspaper for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also a group of people who I </v>

40
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:31.511
<v Speaker 1>trust with my ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both in finished form and in the kind of</v>

41
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:34.664
<v Speaker 1>tentative grope me that you do when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to figure out your </v>

42
00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:43.931
<v Speaker 1>reaction to things like the saddleback </v>
<v Speaker 1>forum where Mccain and Obama appeared in</v>

43
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.270
<v Speaker 1>last week.</v>

45
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.470

<v Speaker 1>information with really expert guides.</v>

46
00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.630
