1
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>That is a contradiction between economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth and the public space.</v>

2
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.330
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the most crucial competitive</v>

3
00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:27.331
<v Speaker 1>factor in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our time is he's not like the car,</v>

4
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>the cruiser competitive factor in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

5
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:37.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he was in the past land or</v>
<v Speaker 1>even capital,</v>

6
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.950
<v Speaker 1>but people how to attract and retain the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best qualified people.</v>

7
00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:46.840
<v Speaker 1>So I would say the most crucial</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive issue in our time is quality</v>

8
00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:51.430
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A public space is crucial for quality of</v>

9
00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:53.590
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Public pedestrian space,</v>

10
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.243
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

11
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.790
<v Speaker 1>gives us quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs to retain great people at.</v>

12
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.140
<v Speaker 1>But also it's very important for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who live there themselves for the</v>

13
00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:11.840
<v Speaker 1>poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that there is no contradiction</v>

14
00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:16.841
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever in trying to have investments</v>
<v Speaker 1>in great public pedestrian space,</v>

15
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.470
<v Speaker 1>but gratefully space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however different from most things</v>

16
00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:28.820
<v Speaker 1>governments do is not just a means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most things governments do are a means</v>

17
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:32.210
<v Speaker 1>to economic development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Governments invents the roads in</v>

18
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.880
<v Speaker 1>tunnels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in irrigation districts,</v>

19
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:36.440
<v Speaker 1>in ports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in airports,</v>

20
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.993
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

21
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.320
<v Speaker 1>because it's necessarily for the country</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

22
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.870
<v Speaker 1>to produce material,</v>

23
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.253
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

24
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>goods and services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

25
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.840
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are a means to an end.</v>

26
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.890
<v Speaker 1>The end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the end?</v>

27
00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:57.830
<v Speaker 1>The end is happiness in the case of</v>
<v Speaker 1>politic.</v>

28
00:01:57.831 --> 00:02:02.831
<v Speaker 1>Pedestrian space is a very peculiar good</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's an end in itself.</v>

29
00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:07.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just to have great public</v>
<v Speaker 1>space makes people happier and creates</v>

30
00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:10.160
<v Speaker 1>more social integration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

31
00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:14.870
<v Speaker 1>I believe it also creates economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>development because actually,</v>

32
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.340
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I asked some people to go live in</v>

33
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:24.110
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some cities in the third world have</v>

34
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:29.111
<v Speaker 1>serious problems like Lego's in Nigeria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people want to get</v>

35
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:32.803
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

36
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.030
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person to go live in lake or some,</v>

37
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:39.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some expert engineer in something,</v>

38
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.630
<v Speaker 1>they will have to pay him very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much to compensate for the</v>

39
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 1>hardships of being in Legos if they had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

40
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.080
<v Speaker 1>when people go to Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens.</v>

41
00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:54.070
<v Speaker 1>The opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are willing to take a reduction</v>

42
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>in their material will be in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go to a,</v>

43
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.400
<v Speaker 1>they may go without a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go with a much smaller apartment</v>

44
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.520
<v Speaker 1>because the city gave them so much back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So actually to invest in a good city is</v>

45
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>good business is not robots and making</v>
<v Speaker 1>investment decisions.</v>

46
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.430
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

47
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.720
<v Speaker 1>we need to make us eat that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive to the people we most want to</v>

48
00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:28.911
<v Speaker 1>have an sat</v>
<v Speaker 1>at adults who could actually go anywhere</v>

49
00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:34.341
<v Speaker 1>in the world they want because they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>such good technicians or an artist or a</v>

50
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.880
<v Speaker 1>professionals or whatever they do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could choose to go wherever they</v>

51
00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:44.310
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we don't have a great city,</v>

52
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.780
<v Speaker 3>they will.</v>
