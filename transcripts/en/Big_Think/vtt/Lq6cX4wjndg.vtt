00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.260
<v Speaker 2>what used to be called a conservative</v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican and a conservative meant you</v>

3
00:00:18.261 --> 00:00:22.060
<v Speaker 2>were a fiscal conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wanted a strong national security</v>

4
00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:26.020
<v Speaker 2>and defense policy and you want it</v>
<v Speaker 2>limited but meaningful government after</v>

8
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.100
<v Speaker 2>talk about a family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives and social conservatives.</v>

9
00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:42.580
<v Speaker 2>And that's certainly not me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact I'm defined by that set is a</v>

10
00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 2>rhino Republican in name only.</v>
