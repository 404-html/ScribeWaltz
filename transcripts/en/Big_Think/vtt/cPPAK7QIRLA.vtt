00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>There's a trajectory in the shows that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have done at Moma up in there,</v>

2
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:15.300
<v Speaker 1>it's almost 14 years and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trajectory that is personal,</v>

3
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>but that it's at the same time as</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutional,</v>

4
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning.</v>

5
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:23.691
<v Speaker 1>Moma has alternated in design very</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical exhibitions that are meant to</v>

6
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 1>advance the scholarly field with</v>
<v Speaker 1>exhibitions that are instead and</v>

7
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>programs that are instead about people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives,</v>

8
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>about how design can improve people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives,</v>

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.180
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>issues that pertain to that particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

11
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Just to give you an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>Moma had a series in the 19 thirties</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was called good called good design</v>

13
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 1>under $5,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$10,</v>

14
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:47.070
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah during the war because you,</v>

15
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.970
<v Speaker 1>because people had no access to steel</v>
<v Speaker 1>and aluminum and other materials.</v>

16
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>They did a show called good design in</v>
<v Speaker 1>times of war.</v>

17
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>So it was always with an attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's needs in my particular,</v>

18
00:00:58.921 --> 00:00:59.754
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

19
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

20
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I tried always to look at both people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives and also technology advancements</v>

21
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.880
<v Speaker 1>in always this to this two spheres</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming together.</v>

22
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 1>So the first show that I did in 95 was</v>
<v Speaker 1>called Newton materials and contemporary</v>

23
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 1>design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about a revolution in the way</v>

24
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>materials were designed and implemented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that gave designers more power</v>

25
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>to actually find to not only the objects</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the materials,</v>

26
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 1>so it was technology and it was life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I went on and did other shows.</v>

27
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you cut in between?</v>

28
00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I went on and did other shows</v>

29
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>that were about people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to give you an example,</v>

30
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:43.821
<v Speaker 1>in 2000 I did a show called work spheres</v>
<v Speaker 1>because@thattimeitwasthe.com boom.</v>

31
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>It was the beginning of wireless</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

32
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:49.190
<v Speaker 1>so there was a lot of excitement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all went,</v>

33
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.990
<v Speaker 1>almost were all drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

34
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>With this kind of possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time wireless technology</v>

35
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:56.070
<v Speaker 1>was not really working.</v>

36
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>We were always traveling with too many</v>
<v Speaker 1>plugs and then the plug didn't work.</v>

37
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>The server at home did not connect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had to dial in.</v>

38
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was about wireless technology,</v>

39
00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>new possibilities and people's real</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

40
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>So it was all this new concepts for</v>
<v Speaker 1>working and traveling and so on and so</v>

41
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And about two years ago I did a show on</v>

42
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:20.370
<v Speaker 1>design and safety because safety has</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a really big concern,</v>

43
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world has changed.</v>

44
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to explain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was something that was conceived</v>

45
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:25.650
<v Speaker 1>before nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

46
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 1>and it was topped by 9:11 because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>freaked out at that time and waited for</v>

47
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was only two years ago,</v>

48
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>but it was about design and safety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I've come to the point that wireless</v>

49
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>technology really works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we really are in communication with</v>

50
00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>many different parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We work at different scales,</v>

51
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:46.980
<v Speaker 1>we work in different time zones on</v>
<v Speaker 1>screens,</v>

52
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>have different resolutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We speak with people from all over the</v>

53
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:53.670
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are sometimes alone and sometimes in</v>

54
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:57.120
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the gigantic route we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>become much more elastic.</v>

55
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.480
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

56
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 1>it's an about these possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new technologies and the connection</v>

57
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 1>between design and science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it really is about us negotiating all</v>

58
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:10.520
<v Speaker 1>these changes and negotiating progress</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the help of design.</v>
