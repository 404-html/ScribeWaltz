1
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't take long.</v>

2
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 1>When you start to develop a practice of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindfulness before you realize that we</v>

3
00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:18.460
<v Speaker 1>are virtually continually bombarded by</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>

4
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like weather patterns in the mind.</v>

5
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.440
<v Speaker 1>The legs said there are some times like</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice clear sunny days,</v>

6
00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:28.330
<v Speaker 1>but there are an awful lot of cloudy</v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

7
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.700
<v Speaker 1>tumultuous days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rainy days,</v>

8
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.030
<v Speaker 1>turbulent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stormy weather.</v>

9
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges.</v>

10
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 1>How are we to be in relationship to all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that stuff that's driving our lives</v>

11
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.180
<v Speaker 1>and our narrative of who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

12
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.600
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

14
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.290
<v Speaker 1>get in touch with</v>
<v Speaker 1>what awareness really is,</v>

15
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.250
<v Speaker 1>then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you realize is that</v>

16
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.340
<v Speaker 1>those thoughts are not me and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not mine.</v>

17
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>They're just like weather patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Impersonal weather patterns in the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you can observe them like a</v>

19
00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:15.680
<v Speaker 1>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

20
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.120
<v Speaker 1>what is the nature of this thought?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does it come from?</v>

21
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they come like bullets,</v>

22
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:25.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fired out of a machine gun there very,</v>

23
00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:27.110
<v Speaker 1>very fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

24
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a quite militaristic image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

25
00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:35.060
<v Speaker 1>another way is bubbles coming off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of a pot of boiling water.</v>

26
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:37.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever watched a pot of boiling</v>

27
00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:38.720
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.240
<v Speaker 1>say a glass pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

29
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.680
<v Speaker 1>the bubbles tend to nucleate at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom and then they go through the</v>

30
00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:50.681
<v Speaker 1>water and they go poof at the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thoughts are very similar and</v>

31
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:54.410
<v Speaker 1>that's when I use another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.490
<v Speaker 1>people often use this term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thoughts self liberate.</v>

33
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People misunderstand meditation is,</v>

34
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just sweep all my thoughts away and</v>

35
00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:08.360
<v Speaker 1>then I'm in this like Nirvana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you'll get by trying to sweep all</v>

36
00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:12.850
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts away is a headache at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most because there's no way to sweep</v>

37
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will get you every time.</v>

38
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can have millions of</v>

39
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:22.250
<v Speaker 1>thoughts about mindfulness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation and those are just thoughts</v>

40
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:23.630
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not meditating.</v>

41
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.630
<v Speaker 1>But when you see that you're not your</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>

42
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.570
<v Speaker 1>then you can watch them in this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>impersonal,</v>

43
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 1>more sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>

44
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.160
<v Speaker 1>observing way with kindness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with self compassion,</v>

45
00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of them are heavily loaded</v>
<v Speaker 1>with negative emotion.</v>

46
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.810
<v Speaker 1>And you can see that if you don't touch</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

47
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.430
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do anything with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't get caught in the them,</v>

48
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.060
<v Speaker 1>they self liberate naturally in</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness,</v>

49
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.850
<v Speaker 1>the awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like touching a soap bubble.</v>

50
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.210
<v Speaker 1>You know it's fun for kids and fun for</v>
<v Speaker 1>adults.</v>

51
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Soap bubble and you touch it and it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>

52
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

53
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.820
<v Speaker 1>So I love that image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like let the thought is the soap</v>

54
00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:10.700
<v Speaker 1>bubble and the emotion too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's you know,</v>

55
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.930
<v Speaker 1>balancing the thought and you don't need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to anything with it because your</v>

56
00:03:14.931 --> 00:03:17.210
<v Speaker 1>awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like if not even a finger,</v>

57
00:03:17.211 --> 00:03:19.640
<v Speaker 1>it's not corporeal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the awareness,</v>

58
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.640
<v Speaker 1>just the embracing of it or the arising</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

59
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Like in the sky it goes poof all by</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

60
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.590
<v Speaker 1>And don't take my word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that when you sit down</v>

61
00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:34.070
<v Speaker 1>and you begin to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see this is not rocket science.</v>

62
00:03:34.071 --> 00:03:36.260
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have to sit in a cave for</v>

63
00:03:36.261 --> 00:03:38.150
<v Speaker 1>30 years to have that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

64
00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:41.090
<v Speaker 1>well you need to do is in some sense get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of your own way.</v>

65
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.030
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not saying that it's easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really hard.</v>

66
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.820
<v Speaker 1>But if you can have moments when you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of your own way,</v>

67
00:03:46.821 --> 00:03:51.821
<v Speaker 1>then you'll see that a lot of this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we get so caught up and it's like</v>

68
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a mirage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean that the thoughts</v>

69
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.180
<v Speaker 1>aren't valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

70
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Einstein who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.010
<v Speaker 1>if you have one or two really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts in a lifetime,</v>

72
00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:05.030
<v Speaker 1>you are ahead of the curve.</v>

73
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Paraphrasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

74
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.100
<v Speaker 1>so most of our thoughts are actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of mundane or imprisoning,</v>

75
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.270
<v Speaker 1>but thinking is a ferry ferry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it drives imagination,</v>

76
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>drives creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe we need to just create a bigger</v>

77
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 1>arena for our thoughts and watch how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

78
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 1>not only self liberate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also inform each other in some</v>

79
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:32.560
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden you see</v>

80
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>something that no one in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity is seen</v>

81
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.833
<v Speaker 2>before</v>

82
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.460
<v Speaker 1>and you were apprehended</v>

83
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.800
<v Speaker 1>because you're making your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or your something is being revealed to</v>

84
00:04:48.801 --> 00:04:49.970
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't say you're making the</v>

85
00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:52.100
<v Speaker 1>connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somehow a connection gets made.</v>

86
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's called an insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have profound insights.</v>

87
00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:57.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:04:57.951 --> 00:05:00.410
<v Speaker 1>sort of storied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:05:00.411 --> 00:05:03.890
<v Speaker 1>wonderful stories of Eureka moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insight where,</v>

90
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.460
<v Speaker 1>and it's usually not by driving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking and banging your head against</v>

91
00:05:07.461 --> 00:05:09.950
<v Speaker 1>the world's way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you thought as much as you've gone</v>

92
00:05:09.951 --> 00:05:13.790
<v Speaker 1>as far as thought can take you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you rest in awareness.</v>

93
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Maybe sometimes it's in sleep or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wake up out of asleep and then no.</v>
