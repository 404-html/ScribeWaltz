1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.900
<v Speaker 1>For over a 200 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world has been set on fire by a</v>

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.050
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The message is that every individual</v>

3
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 1>human being is a divine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That all of us,</v>

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>despite the constraints and humiliations</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's around us,</v>

5
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.350
<v Speaker 1>can share in a greater life and share</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in the attributes that we ascribe</v>

6
00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

7
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:36.861
<v Speaker 1>the ordinary experience of human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>remains an experience of belittlement.</v>

8
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.930
<v Speaker 1>This revolutionary message can only be</v>
<v Speaker 1>made real through a series of</v>

9
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>transformations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations in how we organize</v>

10
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:55.941
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in how we live and in how we understand</v>

11
00:00:56.251 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not enough to innovate in our</v>

12
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:05.691
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We must also innovate in our basic ideas</v>

13
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.810
<v Speaker 1>about who we are unless we innovate in</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas as well as in the</v>

14
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:20.331
<v Speaker 1>arrangements of society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We cannot turn the message of our</v>

15
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:26.721
<v Speaker 1>divinity into a real experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:31.921
<v Speaker 1>and thus the need today for a spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution as well as for a social</v>

17
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

18
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>The focus of my thinking expressed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this book,</v>

19
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:43.851
<v Speaker 1>the religion of the future lies</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely there in the relation between</v>

20
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.640
<v Speaker 1>the transformation of personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and the reorganization of</v>

21
00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:54.771
<v Speaker 1>social life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the major religions and philosophies</v>

22
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>that have exerted the greatest influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last 2000 years,</v>

23
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arose from a series of religious</v>

24
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:12.081
<v Speaker 1>revolutions that took place around 2000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

25
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.970
<v Speaker 1>And these religions took three main</v>
<v Speaker 1>directions,</v>

26
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>one direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one my call overcoming the world.</v>

27
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:25.051
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:30.051
<v Speaker 1>an example is Buddhism and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophies that prevailed in ancient</v>

29
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is a position to also represented</v>

30
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>in modern Western thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

31
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:42.180
<v Speaker 1>by Schopenhauer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to this view,</v>

32
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.570
<v Speaker 1>all the distinctions and changes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>surround us are illusory.</v>

33
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Our task,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we are to escape from suffering,</v>

34
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Speaker 1>is to communicate with the hidden and</v>
<v Speaker 1>unified being a and to escape this</v>

35
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>nightmare of the apparent world.</v>

36
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.360
<v Speaker 1>A second orientation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>when my called the humanization of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

38
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.200
<v Speaker 1>And it's teaches us that in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless world we can create meaning.</v>

39
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.850
<v Speaker 1>We can open a clearing space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a social order that bears the imprint of</v>

40
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:30.301
<v Speaker 1>our humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in particular we can do so by</v>

41
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.760
<v Speaker 1>creating a society that conforms to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>model of what we owe to one another by</v>

42
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:43.381
<v Speaker 1>virtue of occupying certain roles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most important example of this</v>

43
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:48.721
<v Speaker 1>position in the history of religion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy has been confucianism.</v>

44
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>The third direction is the direction</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I called him.</v>

45
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>This book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the religion of the future,</v>

46
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.900
<v Speaker 1>the struggle with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tells us that there is a trajectory</v>

47
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.380
<v Speaker 1>of ascent by which through changes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we live and in how we organize</v>

48
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:15.841
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can rise to a greater life and share</v>

49
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>and the attributes that we ascribe to</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

50
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thus this ascent requires a</v>

51
00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:26.530
<v Speaker 1>struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I call it the struggle with the</v>

52
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

53
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>this third direction has had two main</v>
<v Speaker 1>phases in history,</v>

54
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.920
<v Speaker 1>a sacred face and a profane face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sacred face is represented in the</v>

55
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Semitic monotheisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judaism,</v>

56
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:48.061
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the profane face in the political</v>

57
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>projects of liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism,</v>

58
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>and democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the project of personal</v>

59
00:04:56.891 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 1>liberation that has been represented by</v>
<v Speaker 1>romanticism,</v>

60
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.120
<v Speaker 1>both the original romantic movement and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worldwide popular romantic culture.</v>

61
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.540
<v Speaker 1>The third direction teaches us that each</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us is bigger than he seems to be,</v>

62
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.760
<v Speaker 1>that each of us is called to share in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greater life and to participate in</v>

63
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>this divinity that we sometimes treat as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a separate entity.</v>

64
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:30.430
<v Speaker 1>They created the world and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>intervenes in history.</v>

65
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.390
<v Speaker 1>It is this third direction that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>exerted the greatest influence on</v>

66
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:41.461
<v Speaker 1>humanity over the last couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries in forming a series of</v>

67
00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:46.891
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary projects in politics and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in culture that have set the whole world</v>

68
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 1>on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of these religions in each of</v>

69
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:55.810
<v Speaker 1>these three directions that I have just</v>
<v Speaker 1>described,</v>

70
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.590
<v Speaker 1>despite their amends differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>share certain common characteristics.</v>

71
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 1>One of these characteristics is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have represented,</v>

72
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 1>as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of two sided ticket.</v>

73
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 1>One side of the ticket is a license to</v>
<v Speaker 1>escape the world.</v>

74
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.000
<v Speaker 1>A second side of the ticket is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>invitation to change the world,</v>

75
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 1>and this ambivalence has never been</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully resolved.</v>

76
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Another common characteristic of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>religions is that each of them in some</v>

77
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>denies or seeks to compensate for the</v>

78
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:42.440
<v Speaker 1>incorrigible flaws in the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>condition,</v>

79
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.670
<v Speaker 1>our mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our groundlessness and rn insatiability.</v>

80
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Despite the fecundity of our experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite this fundamental aspect of our</v>

81
00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that there is always more in us</v>

82
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.980
<v Speaker 1>than there is in all of the social and</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual worlds that we build and</v>

83
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 1>inhabit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are all doomed to die.</v>

84
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.160
<v Speaker 1>We cannot look into the beginning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of time or understand the framework</v>

85
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.370
<v Speaker 1>of our existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our presuppositions never reached rock</v>

86
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:21.920
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>

87
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.920
<v Speaker 1>The bottom is bottomless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our groundlessness and all of us</v>

88
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.370
<v Speaker 1>human beings demand the unlimited from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the limited and project this demand for</v>

89
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:40.040
<v Speaker 1>the unlimited onto particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate objects.</v>

90
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.760
<v Speaker 1>That's our insatiability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these religions have attempted to</v>

91
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:50.981
<v Speaker 1>say that there is a solution and</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidote that we in fact will not die or</v>

92
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.990
<v Speaker 1>at least that there is some</v>
<v Speaker 1>compensation,</v>

93
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:03.040
<v Speaker 1>some compensation for these enigmas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrors of our existence and entirely</v>

94
00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:10.181
<v Speaker 1>different moment in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion would begin if we accepted</v>

95
00:08:10.671 --> 00:08:15.671
<v Speaker 1>these realities for what they are and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer attempted to deny them.</v>

96
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Given the enormous impact</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the third direction that I described,</v>

97
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.720
<v Speaker 1>the struggle with the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>on humanity over the last two centuries,</v>

98
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:41.650
<v Speaker 1>one my desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the core of its message and why</v>

99
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:47.951
<v Speaker 1>has this message been so seductive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two ideas that that stand at</v>

100
00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:56.501
<v Speaker 1>the center of this view of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both on its religious side,</v>

101
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:00.840
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

102
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.930
<v Speaker 1>The Near Eastern religions of salvation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judaism,</v>

103
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on it's profane side,</v>

104
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.640
<v Speaker 1>the projects of political and personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberation.</v>

105
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:18.230
<v Speaker 1>One set of ideas has to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relation between the self and others.</v>

106
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.250
<v Speaker 1>The dominant view in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

107
00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:28.251
<v Speaker 1>religion and philosophy and indeed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern academic moral philosophy is that</v>

108
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental problem of moral life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfishness.</v>

109
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 1>And the solution to selfishness is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>principle of altruism.</v>

110
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:40.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

111
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:45.430
<v Speaker 1>And this principle of altruism is to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>enforced by conformity to certain rules</v>

112
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.970
<v Speaker 1>that define our obligations to one</v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

113
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.620
<v Speaker 1>And these rules are to be determined by</v>
<v Speaker 1>some conceptual method like cons,</v>

114
00:09:57.451 --> 00:10:02.450
<v Speaker 1>categorical imperative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Bentham's calculus of the greatest</v>

115
00:10:02.451 --> 00:10:07.451
<v Speaker 1>happiness for the greatest number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is an attitude connected to those</v>

116
00:10:10.641 --> 00:10:14.750
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The attitude is that we should try to</v>

117
00:10:14.751 --> 00:10:19.100
<v Speaker 1>come to the end of our lives blameless</v>
<v Speaker 1>with clean hands,</v>

118
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.360
<v Speaker 1>having discharged our obligations to one</v>
<v Speaker 1>another on the green side of our book of</v>

119
00:10:26.481 --> 00:10:27.470
<v Speaker 1>moral accounts.</v>

120
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:29.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

121
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:34.850
<v Speaker 1>but that is not the view that stands at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the core of the moral beliefs of this</v>

122
00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:38.790
<v Speaker 1>third tradition</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

123
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:43.770
<v Speaker 1>The view is that the basic problem of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our moral experience is not selfishness,</v>

124
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.940
<v Speaker 1>but rather a contradiction in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions of personality and in our</v>

125
00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:55.290
<v Speaker 1>relations to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need the others,</v>

126
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:59.550
<v Speaker 1>we make ourselves into human beings only</v>
<v Speaker 1>through connection,</v>

127
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:05.750
<v Speaker 1>but every connection is a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every connection jeopardizes our</v>

128
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:08.160
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our autonomy,</v>

129
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.360
<v Speaker 1>our self construction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thus all of our relations to the</v>

130
00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:16.650
<v Speaker 1>others are shadowed by an inescapable</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambivalence.</v>

131
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Sartre says the others are hell</v>
<v Speaker 1>describing aphoristic Lee,</v>

132
00:11:23.071 --> 00:11:26.490
<v Speaker 1>this one side of this ambivalence.</v>

133
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

134
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:34.070
<v Speaker 1>so what is then the solution that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lies at the center of this idea?</v>

135
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:41.060
<v Speaker 1>The solution is radical love in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>circle of intimacy and then some form of</v>

136
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:49.671
<v Speaker 1>cooperation of free and equal</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperation outside the circle of</v>

137
00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 1>intimacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this practical solution,</v>

138
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:58.720
<v Speaker 1>if one can call it that depends on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>imaginative capability,</v>

139
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.720
<v Speaker 1>the capacity to imagine the others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to imagine their otherness.</v>

140
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.280
<v Speaker 1>And that is then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the teaching,</v>

141
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:11.460
<v Speaker 1>the real teaching that lives at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the center of this tradition</v>

142
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.330
<v Speaker 1>for the ancients and for most of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world religions and philosophies,</v>

143
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.800
<v Speaker 1>the highest ideal was the ideal of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>impersonal and impersonal and detached</v>

144
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.530
<v Speaker 1>benevolence from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from on high,</v>

145
00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:32.830
<v Speaker 1>from a distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>implying no,</v>

146
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.520
<v Speaker 1>no risk on the part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the [inaudible] of the benevolent</v>

147
00:12:38.741 --> 00:12:41.890
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here now comes a different</v>

148
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:46.120
<v Speaker 1>conception that this impersonal</v>
<v Speaker 1>altruism,</v>

149
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:51.150
<v Speaker 1>this gift of benevolence from on high is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact not the center of our moral</v>

150
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:53.620
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

151
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 1>That the highest form of moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience is reconciliation's Ian with</v>

152
00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:04.201
<v Speaker 1>the other on the basis of equality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the price of a heightened</v>

153
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:10.210
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a second set of ideas at the</v>

154
00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:14.890
<v Speaker 1>center of this tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the second set of ideas has to do</v>

155
00:13:14.891 --> 00:13:19.891
<v Speaker 1>with the relation between the structures</v>
<v Speaker 1>of social life</v>

156
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.650
<v Speaker 1>and the human spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

157
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.680
<v Speaker 1>what I mean by spirit is the aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our humanity that has to do with our</v>

158
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:35.250
<v Speaker 1>excess over all the regimes that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>create and inhabit.</v>

159
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two distortions that have had</v>

160
00:13:42.311 --> 00:13:44.530
<v Speaker 1>a long career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

161
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.190
<v Speaker 1>in the history of religious and</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical thinking.</v>

162
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.580
<v Speaker 1>One distortion might be called the heck</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ganean heresy.</v>

163
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:56.581
<v Speaker 1>It's the idea that there is a definitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure towards which history is</v>

164
00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:02.590
<v Speaker 1>evolving and which will be the final</v>
<v Speaker 1>home of the human spirit.</v>

165
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.090
<v Speaker 1>And the other heresy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one might call the Sartrean heresy or</v>

166
00:14:07.091 --> 00:14:10.690
<v Speaker 1>the romantic heresy or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialist heresy,</v>

167
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:16.110
<v Speaker 1>and it was prefigured by the mystics</v>
<v Speaker 1>within Judaism,</v>

168
00:14:16.151 --> 00:14:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to this heresy,</v>

169
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:26.100
<v Speaker 1>every structure is death to the spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the routines of marriage by contrast</v>

170
00:14:29.891 --> 00:14:34.891
<v Speaker 1>to romantic love or the bureaucratic</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparatus of the state in opposition to</v>

171
00:14:36.701 --> 00:14:41.210
<v Speaker 1>the crowd in the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't get rid of the structures</v>

172
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:45.160
<v Speaker 1>definitively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can momentarily rebel against</v>

173
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:49.090
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these interludes of rebellion or</v>

174
00:14:49.091 --> 00:14:51.650
<v Speaker 1>then the time when we become most fully</v>
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>

175
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:59.140
<v Speaker 1>So it is a kind of despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a failure of our hope of changing</v>

176
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:06.041
<v Speaker 1>the relation of structured to spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now these two sets of ideas about the</v>

177
00:15:09.691 --> 00:15:14.691
<v Speaker 1>self and others and spirit and structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>have never been adequately developed,</v>

178
00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:24.050
<v Speaker 1>much less fully realized in political</v>
<v Speaker 1>and personal practice in the history of</v>

179
00:15:25.801 --> 00:15:26.820
<v Speaker 1>our civilization.</v>

180
00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

181
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Both the political doctrines and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious traditions have lived in</v>

182
00:15:34.531 --> 00:15:38.520
<v Speaker 1>compromise with the existing forms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>social organization,</v>

183
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with ethical attitudes that</v>

184
00:15:42.421 --> 00:15:47.421
<v Speaker 1>contradict their impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is another reason for spiritual</v>

185
00:15:48.451 --> 00:15:49.440
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

186
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:52.290
<v Speaker 1>if we were to take these ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

187
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:57.590
<v Speaker 1>if we were to push them to the hilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were to ask how we should live</v>

188
00:15:58.801 --> 00:16:03.210
<v Speaker 1>under the light of these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would come to a completely different</v>

189
00:16:03.211 --> 00:16:06.640
<v Speaker 1>conception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a completely different conception of art</v>

190
00:16:06.641 --> 00:16:10.770
<v Speaker 1>situation in the world and of the way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>organize society.</v>

191
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.940
<v Speaker 1>We have in fact in the history of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

192
00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:22.490
<v Speaker 1>in the history of the culture that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been shaped by this third tradition,</v>

193
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.980
<v Speaker 1>the tradition of the struggle with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

194
00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Only two completely developed images of</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to live.</v>

195
00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:38.130
<v Speaker 1>One is the image of the sacrificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>altruist</v>

196
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:45.280
<v Speaker 1>who devotes himself to the others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without experiencing any intimate risk</v>

197
00:16:48.081 --> 00:16:52.790
<v Speaker 1>or jeopardy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other is the image of the</v>

198
00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:57.791
<v Speaker 1>romantic adventure</v>
<v Speaker 1>who experience life as a perpetual</v>

199
00:17:00.731 --> 00:17:01.564
<v Speaker 1>trial.</v>

200
00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

201
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.460
<v Speaker 1>In the effort to deepen and affirm his</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjectivity.</v>

202
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Neither of these images is adequate as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conception of how to live.</v>

203
00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.900
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the absence of an alternative view</v>

204
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:22.320
<v Speaker 1>demonstrates once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the need for religious revolution.</v>

205
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>
<v Speaker 1>one should begin by understanding the,</v>

206
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.330
<v Speaker 1>the points of departure and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the provocations for,</v>

207
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.780
<v Speaker 1>for such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a spiritual change.</v>

208
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

209
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.120
<v Speaker 1>So one provocation</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the need no longer to deny the</v>

210
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:50.510
<v Speaker 1>incurable defects in the human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our mortality,</v>

211
00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:54.690
<v Speaker 1>our groundlessness and Dora</v>
<v Speaker 1>insatiability.</v>

212
00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:01.330
<v Speaker 1>A second provocation is the importance</v>
<v Speaker 1>of not confusing our belittlement with</v>

213
00:18:07.761 --> 00:18:10.950
<v Speaker 1>these in escapable defects in human</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

214
00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:17.880
<v Speaker 1>we are belittled and humiliated all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>us in some way to some degree.</v>

215
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:24.950
<v Speaker 1>But this belittlement has a cure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike our mortality,</v>

216
00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:27.930
<v Speaker 1>our groundlessness and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>insatiability.</v>

217
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.010
<v Speaker 1>The cure is for us to make ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>

218
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:37.550
<v Speaker 1>to ascend to a higher life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that cure requires a reorientation</v>

219
00:18:38.371 --> 00:18:42.360
<v Speaker 1>of the way we live and of the way in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we organize society.</v>

220
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

221
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:47.970
<v Speaker 1>And a third provocation to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual change,</v>

222
00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is then the,</v>

223
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:56.421
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unwillingness to allow those ideas</v>

224
00:18:57.091 --> 00:19:02.091
<v Speaker 1>about self and others and spirit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure to be compromised and</v>

225
00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:07.551
<v Speaker 1>circumvented as they have been in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of our religions and of our</v>

226
00:19:08.641 --> 00:19:09.510
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>

227
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

228
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what does this mean?</v>

229
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.600
<v Speaker 1>What does this mean by way of a moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>orientation and what does it mean by way</v>

230
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.250
<v Speaker 1>of a political project?</v>

231
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:24.783
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

232
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Let me illustrate what it means by way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a moral orientation.</v>

233
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:33.323
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>

234
00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

235
00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Referring to</v>
<v Speaker 1>how each of us is to respond to one of</v>

236
00:19:44.241 --> 00:19:48.530
<v Speaker 1>the characteristic incidents in every</v>
<v Speaker 1>human life.</v>

237
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

238
00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.330
<v Speaker 1>As we grow older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of us a,</v>

239
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.920
<v Speaker 1>a shell of compromise and routine begins</v>
<v Speaker 1>to form around us.</v>

240
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.930
<v Speaker 1>The self becomes rigidified in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

241
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.620
<v Speaker 1>The ancient Greeks said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but character is fate.</v>

242
00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Character is the rigidified form of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>self.</v>

243
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:18.490
<v Speaker 1>And the marriage of the character with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>social circumstance to which we are</v>

244
00:20:18.491 --> 00:20:23.491
<v Speaker 1>resigned then becomes a proxy for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>living self.</v>

245
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:29.590
<v Speaker 1>A mummy that begins to form around each</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us within which</v>

246
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:36.810
<v Speaker 1>each of us slowly dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many small debts.</v>

247
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we must then do is to break the</v>

248
00:20:42.471 --> 00:20:43.340
<v Speaker 1>mummy apart.</v>

249
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.943
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

250
00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bedroom live.</v>

251
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to become more God likes so that we</v>

252
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:55.540
<v Speaker 1>can live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do not live to become more godlike.</v>

253
00:20:55.541 --> 00:21:00.541
<v Speaker 1>We become more godlike to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how were we to break the mummy</v>

254
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:06.361
<v Speaker 1>apart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We cannot simply will ourselves</v>

255
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.580
<v Speaker 1>transformed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the will can project us into</v>

256
00:21:12.581 --> 00:21:17.581
<v Speaker 1>situations in which we are unprotected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which we lose our habitual</v>

257
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:23.110
<v Speaker 1>protections in which we are forced to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become more vulnerable.</v>

258
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:25.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

259
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.410
<v Speaker 1>And in this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

260
00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.190
<v Speaker 1>awakened to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a greater life.</v>

261
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:37.690
<v Speaker 1>So the rebellion against mummification</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one of the many telling consequences</v>

262
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:45.070
<v Speaker 1>of such a reorientation to existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does it mean by way of a</v>

263
00:21:46.071 --> 00:21:47.510
<v Speaker 1>political project?</v>

264
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

265
00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for two centuries now,</v>

266
00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:59.260
<v Speaker 1>ideological debate in the world has</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken the form of a contrast between</v>

267
00:22:00.471 --> 00:22:04.670
<v Speaker 1>what you might call shallow or quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shallow freedom,</v>

268
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:12.590
<v Speaker 1>the major political forces in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>except the established institutions.</v>

269
00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:18.810
<v Speaker 1>And then we think that the conservatives</v>
<v Speaker 1>are those who within that institutional</v>

270
00:22:18.811 --> 00:22:23.811
<v Speaker 1>framework give priority to freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the progressive's are leftists are</v>

271
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:30.350
<v Speaker 1>those who give priority to equality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is shallow equality against</v>

272
00:22:30.601 --> 00:22:35.100
<v Speaker 1>shallow freedom because it's based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this acceptance of the established</v>

273
00:22:35.101 --> 00:22:38.640
<v Speaker 1>framework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now supposedly imagine that we can begin</v>

274
00:22:38.641 --> 00:22:43.641
<v Speaker 1>to change this framework to innovate in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the institutions that define the market</v>

275
00:22:44.191 --> 00:22:49.191
<v Speaker 1>economy and democratic politics to</v>
<v Speaker 1>democratize the market economy and to</v>

276
00:22:51.271 --> 00:22:56.271
<v Speaker 1>deepen democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The method is the cumulative</v>

277
00:22:57.871 --> 00:23:02.250
<v Speaker 1>institutional transformation of society</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what is the objective?</v>

278
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:06.210
<v Speaker 1>The objective is not equality of outcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>or circumstance.</v>

279
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:11.720
<v Speaker 1>The objective is a greater life for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary man or a woman.</v>

280
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:17.480
<v Speaker 1>That's I would say deep freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who then are the progressive or</v>

281
00:23:17.581 --> 00:23:20.610
<v Speaker 1>revolutionaries today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

282
00:23:20.611 --> 00:23:25.611
<v Speaker 1>they are those who refuse to take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>established institutional structure for</v>

283
00:23:26.791 --> 00:23:28.980
<v Speaker 1>granted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>

284
00:23:28.981 --> 00:23:33.981
<v Speaker 1>they are those who demand not simply to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugarcoat those structures with some</v>

285
00:23:35.371 --> 00:23:40.371
<v Speaker 1>compensatory redistribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to bring the mass of ordinary men</v>

286
00:23:43.621 --> 00:23:48.621
<v Speaker 1>and women to a greater of intensity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>capability and up scope so that they can</v>

287
00:23:50.511 --> 00:23:55.370
<v Speaker 1>live eyes wide awake and share in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes,</v>

288
00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:00.140
<v Speaker 1>in these attributes of transcendence</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we ascribed to the divine.</v>

289
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:06.490
<v Speaker 1>And that then projects us into a world</v>
<v Speaker 1>of institutional proposals.</v>

290
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.080
<v Speaker 1>And institutional changes.</v>
