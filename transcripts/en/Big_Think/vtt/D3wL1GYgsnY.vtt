00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.720
<v Speaker 1>I am a middle school student from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington state,</v>

2
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>as you already know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our environment is threatened by human</v>

3
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>right now and it's time to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people don't see this rack</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they don't want to make a change.</v>

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.700
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we get to influence human to</v>

6
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:26.910
<v Speaker 1>protect the planet in order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something important actions we can do</v>

7
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:29.670
<v Speaker 1>starting right now to save the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's hard,</v>

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>but I just hope that you could give me</v>
<v Speaker 1>some clue.</v>

9
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.143
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

10
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Victoria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Victoria,</v>

11
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:36.260
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

12
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.880
<v Speaker 2>the key to the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend.</v>

13
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.020
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're living in Washington state.</v>

14
00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:44.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived in Seattle for many years.</v>

15
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:45.740
<v Speaker 2>I love Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go seahawks.</v>

16
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend.</v>

17
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Go Mariners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you are in middle school.</v>

18
00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:53.000
<v Speaker 2>You are the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People will tell you that,</v>

19
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:58.001
<v Speaker 2>but they're not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we want you to do is influence</v>

20
00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:03.851
<v Speaker 2>your parents and make sure they vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Voting is the most important thing for</v>

21
00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:07.130
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially this year.</v>

22
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.110
<v Speaker 2>And I want your parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to encourage your parents to</v>

23
00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:16.730
<v Speaker 2>take the environment into account when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they picked people to vote for.</v>

24
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Now you're a governor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jay inslee's,</v>

25
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.430
<v Speaker 2>an acquaintance of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's a big environmental issue and</v>

26
00:01:22.431 --> 00:01:26.270
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a book Apollo's fire and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about the future,</v>

27
00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:31.271
<v Speaker 2>but people are doing to take care of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment and have energy produced</v>

28
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:35.750
<v Speaker 2>electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially renewably without having to</v>

29
00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:37.130
<v Speaker 2>burn fossil fuels.</v>

30
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.490
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's up to you to influence your</v>

31
00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:41.540
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

32
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.130
<v Speaker 2>very important to recycle your plastic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your paper.</v>

33
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Very important to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also in Washington state.</v>

34
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:52.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure exactly where you live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can recycle your food waste</v>

35
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:55.370
<v Speaker 2>along with your yard waste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that becomes compost,</v>

36
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.710
<v Speaker 2>which nurses nourishes our farms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in turn produces food part of the</v>

37
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.720
<v Speaker 2>mythic cycle of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can encourage your parents to do</v>

38
00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:08.750
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we need big ideas,</v>

39
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.590
<v Speaker 2>big changes we need in Washington state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's enormous opportunities for wind,</v>

40
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:18.920
<v Speaker 2>turbans and enormous opportunities for</v>
<v Speaker 2>photovoltaics,</v>

41
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:22.250
<v Speaker 2>for solar cells that takes sunlight and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it right into electricity,</v>

42
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.690
<v Speaker 2>especially in eastern Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can be part of that and you're in</v>

43
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 2>middle school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a turning point for most</v>

44
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:34.100
<v Speaker 2>people in their science education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I hope you Victoria will apply</v>

45
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:37.520
<v Speaker 2>yourself in science class and biology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physics,</v>

46
00:02:37.521 --> 00:02:39.740
<v Speaker 2>chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's probably another class you</v>

47
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:43.340
<v Speaker 2>might have about a planetary science or</v>
<v Speaker 2>astronomy and earth science.</v>

48
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.160
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing Victoria is really</v>
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>

49
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:51.161
<v Speaker 2>especially for girls is Algebra a and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just want to tell you Algebra is this,</v>

50
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 2>this way to think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It trains your brain to think in this</v>

51
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:06.511
<v Speaker 2>way that enables you to imagine</v>
<v Speaker 2>to imagine things to,</v>

52
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 2>to accept that you don't know the</v>
<v Speaker 2>answer,</v>

53
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

54
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really encourage you,</v>

55
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 2>I just tell you that I took Algebra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just have to practice.</v>

56
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 2>There's no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just gotTa do it over and over to</v>

57
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 2>you to get comfortable with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can do it.</v>

58
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're a girl</v>

59
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 2>in middle school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of better at everything than</v>

60
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 2>the boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that'll change in the next four or</v>

61
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:35.790
<v Speaker 2>five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

62
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 2>you'll even out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but right now,</v>

63
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 2>just go with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend.</v>

64
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make sure you learn Algebra and learn</v>

65
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 2>science so that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you choose to be a scientist or</v>

66
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 2>better yet an engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a profession in which you use</v>

67
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:55.381
<v Speaker 2>science to solve problems and make</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you can lead the world in</v>

68
00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 2>these new technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but right now,</v>

69
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do those things at home that make that,</v>

70
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 2>make an important difference at home</v>
<v Speaker 2>recycling and not wasting energy,</v>

71
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 2>not wasting clean water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And make sure your parents take the</v>

72
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 2>environment into account and make sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>they vote.</v>

73
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Thank you Victoria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go get them.</v>
