1
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>It means a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It definitely means a lot.</v>

2
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

3
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I think there were so many people</v>

4
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.900
<v Speaker 1>who doubted that it would actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

5
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.650
<v Speaker 1>There are so many people who said get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cool,</v>

6
00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:32.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to happen or he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna get assassinated.</v>

7
00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:33.561
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

8
00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:36.530
<v Speaker 1>I was watching the Nike Aeration and</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching him getting sworn in.</v>

9
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as there's going to be the shot now,</v>

10
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.880
<v Speaker 1>like I was so scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it meant so much,</v>

11
00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:47.750
<v Speaker 1>I think to our generation and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>coining our generation generation.</v>

12
00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:52.751
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that he exemplified all</v>

13
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:57.770
<v Speaker 1>the possibilities of what you can do if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just believe and try hard enough.</v>

14
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.750
<v Speaker 1>He is the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant.</v>

15
00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:07.310
<v Speaker 1>How ratio augers story that we have had</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country in a long time.</v>

16
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:12.311
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for young people,</v>

17
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.990
<v Speaker 1>especially young people of color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who</v>

18
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>didn't think that that was possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that meant a lot.</v>

19
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that motivated so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us,</v>

20
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>and there's a series of events that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated our generation to be one of</v>

21
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>the greatest generations since the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression generation.</v>

22
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I like one of those was hurricane</v>
<v Speaker 1>Katrina,</v>

23
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 1>one of those was having a Dick in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Office for eight years who hung out with</v>

24
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 1>a Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.913
<v Speaker 1>and then</v>

26
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.700
<v Speaker 1>after that it was getting to that point</v>
<v Speaker 1>of so much frustration that the audacity</v>

27
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.530
<v Speaker 1>that we actually had the audacity to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of our box and elect a young</v>

28
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.230
<v Speaker 1>African American president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is what's redefining our</v>

29
00:02:03.281 --> 00:02:05.890
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only just the economic</v>

30
00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:09.310
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that</v>

31
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>we were so complacent during Bush's</v>
<v Speaker 1>term.</v>

32
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:22.011
<v Speaker 1>We were so overwhelmed by how ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was that we didn't feel like we can</v>

33
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:27.351
<v Speaker 1>do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Obama's when shows that we can,</v>

34
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 1>if we put our minds to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

35
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it meant to me the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

36
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>is that it was very motivating of my own</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal.</v>
