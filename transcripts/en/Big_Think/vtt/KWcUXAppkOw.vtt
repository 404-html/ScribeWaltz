<v Speaker 1>My name is Neil Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>my title is I like to be known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a author of habit.</v>

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.500
<v Speaker 1>The 95% of behavior marketers ignore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I am the founder and CEO of</v>

4
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a consulting company in Atlanta.</v>

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>The real idea just came from watching my</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter use her cell phone,</v>

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teenager,</v>

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the couch right beside the landline</v>

8
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>phone and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something occurred to her.</v>

9
00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>She was online and she just whips her</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phone out and called a friend.</v>

10
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parent in me reacted like all</v>

11
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>parents do like wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one cost me money,</v>

12
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>the other one's free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 1>use that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I realized that what she had</v>

14
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had done unconsciously and it was a</v>

15
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 1>habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I do a lot of work with</v>

16
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>communications companies and I really</v>
<v Speaker 1>started thinking about that idea about,</v>

17
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do unconsciously might explain a</v>

18
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the big problems with</v>

19
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I did my phd in marketing was on</v>

20
00:00:58.171 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>customer satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>

21
00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did all this research tonight,</v>

22
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this complicated mathematical</v>

23
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 1>modeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I did this,</v>

24
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large scale analysis of all this</v>

25
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>research and discovered that customer</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction tells us almost nothing so</v>

26
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:15.870
<v Speaker 1>that if I know how satisfied you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot predict what you're going to do</v>

27
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:16.704
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

28
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
