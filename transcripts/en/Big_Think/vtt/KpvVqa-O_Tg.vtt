1
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.620
<v Speaker 1>So many people have asked blockchain</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

2
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.720
<v Speaker 2>provide answers to challenges that</v>
<v Speaker 2>typically have suffered from lack of</v>

3
00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:16.870
<v Speaker 2>technology that they've suffered from</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor technology applications.</v>

4
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.200
<v Speaker 2>One of those being the way the voting</v>
<v Speaker 2>works in the United States.</v>

5
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

6
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.850
<v Speaker 2>I think of this in three different</v>
<v Speaker 2>distinct phases,</v>

7
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the phase before voting were</v>

8
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.500
<v Speaker 2>keeping track of who is registered to</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote,</v>

9
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and where they're allowed to vote has</v>

10
00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:34.810
<v Speaker 2>seems it's been harder than it should</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been,</v>

11
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a lot of examples of people</v>

12
00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:39.700
<v Speaker 2>showing up at polling places and being</v>
<v Speaker 2>denied the right to vote.</v>

13
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

14
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.480
<v Speaker 2>it seems like paperwork goes missing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get removed from voting roles,</v>

15
00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:47.890
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A public ledger that tracks who is</v>

16
00:00:47.891 --> 00:00:51.430
<v Speaker 2>registered to vote were and allowed</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to look at that from their home</v>

17
00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 2>machine and then confirm that when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed up at the pole,</v>

18
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.070
<v Speaker 2>would do a lot to reestablish trust in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the process of registering to vote and</v>

19
00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:02.350
<v Speaker 2>validating that everybody who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>entitled to vote,</v>

20
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is able to do that right.</v>

21
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Providing an independent verification of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

22
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.073
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

23
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a second phase I'll get to in a</v>

24
00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:10.810
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a third phase which is after</v>

25
00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:13.330
<v Speaker 2>the vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're taking the totals that come</v>

26
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:15.670
<v Speaker 2>from a polling place that come from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

27
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.080
<v Speaker 2>vote by mail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

28
00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:20.140
<v Speaker 2>in Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to kind of trust that the system</v>

29
00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:20.711
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

30
00:01:20.711 --> 00:01:24.640
<v Speaker 2>We have to hope that everything is</v>
<v Speaker 2>counted correctly at the local level and</v>

31
00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:27.640
<v Speaker 2>then it's totaled up correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state level and then reported</v>

32
00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:30.820
<v Speaker 2>nationally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc. And we're fortunately the point</v>

33
00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:31.531
<v Speaker 2>where that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

34
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:33.460
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basis of that trust hasn't been</v>

35
00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:35.710
<v Speaker 2>violated yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in many countries it is in many</v>

36
00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:38.020
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of confidence that the</v>

37
00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:42.340
<v Speaker 2>total from a polling place is actually a</v>
<v Speaker 2>accurately summed up.</v>

38
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.890
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So using A distributed ledger,</v>

39
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.880
<v Speaker 2>not to track the individual votes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to track the totals from each of the</v>

40
00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:52.690
<v Speaker 2>polling places would be a way to allow</v>
<v Speaker 2>the public to understand,</v>

41
00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:54.900
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the local polling place I went and voted</v>

42
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:59.320
<v Speaker 2>at is reporting a thousand votes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>500 for candidate x 500 for candidate.</v>

43
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems about right.</v>

44
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:02.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if my vote specifically</v>
<v Speaker 2>counted,</v>

45
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.400
<v Speaker 2>but I know that at least the polling</v>
<v Speaker 2>place I was at counted appropriately and</v>

46
00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:09.130
<v Speaker 2>they didn't try to be pretend they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>100,000 votes.</v>

47
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the beginning of that process and</v>

48
00:02:11.351 --> 00:02:14.800
<v Speaker 2>the tail end of that process using a</v>
<v Speaker 2>public distributed ledger to record that</v>

49
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.860
<v Speaker 2>makes a lot of sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the middle of the actual act of</v>

50
00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 2>walking into a booth and registering to</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote or um,</v>

51
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.730
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people want to do voting by</v>
<v Speaker 2>mobile device or by,</v>

52
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.820
<v Speaker 2>by computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very worried about that.</v>

53
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.240
<v Speaker 2>The digitization of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our computers fail us all the time and</v>

54
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.860
<v Speaker 2>malware and other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

55
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>threats could really step in and make it</v>

56
00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:36.940
<v Speaker 2>so that I think I'm voting for one</v>
<v Speaker 2>candidate,</v>

57
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.070
<v Speaker 2>but it gets recorded for another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

58
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.470
<v Speaker 2>And we have to think in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the United States,</v>

59
00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:44.020
<v Speaker 2>we care quite a bit about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>confidentiality of our vote.</v>

60
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even to the point where I get no</v>

61
00:02:45.821 --> 00:02:46.631
<v Speaker 2>receipt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

62
00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I can't go to a bar and proved that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>voted for somebody and get a discount</v>

63
00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:50.081
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

64
00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:53.530
<v Speaker 2>That would be considered bribery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we can't simply come up with a system</v>

65
00:02:53.531 --> 00:02:57.670
<v Speaker 2>that puts all the original votes into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>public ledger and provides proof that</v>

66
00:02:57.671 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 2>somebody voted away a certain or that</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes a corruptive process.</v>

67
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 2>So I think we still need voter verified</v>
<v Speaker 2>paper balance as a path to auditing,</v>

68
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 2>but with the registration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning and the summit at the end</v>

69
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 2>conducted by a public ledger think we</v>
<v Speaker 2>would do a tremendous amount to</v>

70
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 2>reestablish confidence in the voting</v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
