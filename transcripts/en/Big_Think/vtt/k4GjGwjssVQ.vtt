1
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes when people talk about sacred</v>

2
00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:12.860
<v Speaker 1>texts for many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing that you say to show</v>

3
00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>how serious you are is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.153
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we take it,</v>

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.670
<v Speaker 1>we take it literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that actually has caused an</v>

6
00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:21.470
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary amount of destruction in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.833
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.150
<v Speaker 1>I began with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to take it literally.</v>

9
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.790
<v Speaker 1>So if it's a poem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a poem and if it's a letter who</v>

10
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:35.060
<v Speaker 1>wrote it and when did they write it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are they writing it to?</v>

11
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.270
<v Speaker 1>What was the world like at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was history,</v>

12
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.690
<v Speaker 1>but the writer is kind of winking along</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

13
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.670
<v Speaker 1>like this is what I'm really saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you take it with that subtlety and</v>

14
00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:54.671
<v Speaker 1>nuance and even humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all religious texts have to be</v>

15
00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:58.700
<v Speaker 1>interpreted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the really dangerous thing is when</v>

16
00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:01.010
<v Speaker 1>someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not giving you my opinion,</v>

17
00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:06.011
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling you what it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's actually their opinion.</v>

18
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 1>If you deny human agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it generally leads to some sort of</v>

19
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:12.830
<v Speaker 1>oppression or exploitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

20
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:15.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything gets way more interesting</v>

21
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.210
<v Speaker 1>when you start reading it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally because you then don't have to</v>

22
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>do those awkward explanations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.910
<v Speaker 1>one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the greatest examples of this is</v>

24
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>there's this ancient story about Jonah</v>
<v Speaker 1>who gets swallowed by a fish.</v>

25
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a whale of fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.000
<v Speaker 1>the counselor says in the ancient texts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the question often becomes a</v>

27
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:38.060
<v Speaker 1>debate about whether or not a guy really</v>
<v Speaker 1>got swallowed by a fish and you have the</v>

28
00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>literalist going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says he got swallowed by a fish,</v>

29
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:42.500
<v Speaker 1>he got swallowed by a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the others going.</v>

30
00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:44.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a larger metaphor.</v>

31
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.570
<v Speaker 1>But what's interesting is the story</v>
<v Speaker 1>begins.</v>

32
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>The Assyrians were the worst neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were the cruel oppressors who had</v>

33
00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:54.740
<v Speaker 1>made life miserable.</v>

34
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.630
<v Speaker 1>And so this man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonah is told,</v>

35
00:01:56.631 --> 00:02:00.710
<v Speaker 1>go and bless Nineveh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineveh was the capital of Syria.</v>

36
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.700
<v Speaker 1>So the story begins with a man being</v>
<v Speaker 1>told,</v>

37
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.690
<v Speaker 1>go bless your worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most heinous enemy.</v>

38
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.350
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't.</v>

39
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.230
<v Speaker 1>He goes the other direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He runs away,</v>

40
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.270
<v Speaker 1>which I think the original audience</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have cheered this man Jonah on</v>

41
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.190
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go the other direction,</v>

42
00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:25.100
<v Speaker 1>whatever you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't go bless the person who has made</v>

43
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:29.000
<v Speaker 1>your life a living hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he eventually gets on a boat.</v>

44
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:31.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a storm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's thrown over board and he's</v>

45
00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:34.850
<v Speaker 1>swallowed by a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the power of the story is not</v>

46
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.010
<v Speaker 1>arguing about whether or not he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>swallowed by a fish.</v>

47
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.220
<v Speaker 1>I think the story was told to a group of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to confront them with how they</v>

48
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.350
<v Speaker 1>cannot forgive their worst enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And will the past and the wounds that</v>

49
00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:52.070
<v Speaker 1>you have suffered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>define you and hold you back.</v>

50
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Or can you forgive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>can you move towards your enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not with violence but with love.</v>

52
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Do the things that have happened to us</v>
<v Speaker 1>define us or is there a love that can</v>

53
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>transcend even this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this would be a classic example to me</v>

54
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 1>where there's an ancient texts and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story where you can,</v>

55
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.690
<v Speaker 1>in your attempt to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>defend it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally actually avoid the more</v>

57
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>interesting questions of the heart that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think are the questions the</v>

58
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>storyteller is trying to get at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

59
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>in our world to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking some of these texts literally has</v>

60
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>caused so much violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

61
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 1>you read the ancient texts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also use your mind,</v>

62
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you listen for what new thing might be</v>

63
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:47.371
<v Speaker 1>happening in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You read it as a fully orbed experience</v>

64
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 1>and then it actually gets quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiring.</v>
