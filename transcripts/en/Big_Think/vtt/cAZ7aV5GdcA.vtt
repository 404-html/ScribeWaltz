1
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.490
<v Speaker 1>A lot better than a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought I was going to start with that.</v>

2
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.540
<v Speaker 1>It is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather surprising to me in some ways</v>

3
00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:23.701
<v Speaker 1>that it's done this well this long</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was taught at the University</v>

4
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.250
<v Speaker 1>of Chicago and northwestern that it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly important for countries to have</v>

5
00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:38.671
<v Speaker 1>savings and to invest a lot in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future and that had a lot to do with how</v>

6
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:43.020
<v Speaker 1>well they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

7
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.040
<v Speaker 1>America today</v>
<v Speaker 1>has the lowest savings rate it has had</v>

8
00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:50.560
<v Speaker 1>in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years.</v>

9
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 1>At the national level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fallen dramatically from all 10,</v>

10
00:00:56.591 --> 00:01:01.591
<v Speaker 1>11 percent of the GDP is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call it down to one or two personal</v>

11
00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:05.530
<v Speaker 1>savings rates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stunningly,</v>

12
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>I've gone from nine percent of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>disposable income to a minus one percent</v>

13
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>and we become very gifted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ardent robust to consumers and</v>

14
00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:23.881
<v Speaker 1>borrowers and savers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the big question is we become huge</v>

15
00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:29.880
<v Speaker 1>borrowers as a country with our very</v>
<v Speaker 1>large deficits.</v>

16
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>We become borrowers at the consumer</v>
<v Speaker 1>level with very hard debt levels and a</v>

17
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.600
<v Speaker 1>really lousy savings levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the big question I have about the</v>

18
00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:44.860
<v Speaker 1>American economy is not today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's how long we think we can</v>

19
00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:49.861
<v Speaker 1>continue because we've got some huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges that are coming.</v>

20
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.220
<v Speaker 1>We have 78 million baby boomers twice</v>
<v Speaker 1>the size of the current generation due</v>

21
00:02:00.911 --> 00:02:05.911
<v Speaker 1>to begin retiring next year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have social security and Medicare</v>

22
00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 1>that are programs that are where we made</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of promises,</v>

23
00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:15.430
<v Speaker 1>but we haven't funded them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've grossly misled.</v>

24
00:02:15.431 --> 00:02:20.431
<v Speaker 1>The American people was such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>euphemisms as the social security trust</v>

25
00:02:23.441 --> 00:02:26.860
<v Speaker 1>fund.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I argue it's oxymoron.</v>

26
00:02:26.861 --> 00:02:31.090
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be trusted and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>funded because the money's already been</v>

27
00:02:31.091 --> 00:02:36.091
<v Speaker 1>spent and we haven't provided for those</v>
<v Speaker 1>programs.</v>

28
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 1>We are getting to be fancy language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have something called a current</v>

29
00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:46.610
<v Speaker 1>account deficit which measures are</v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths.</v>

30
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:50.360
<v Speaker 1>It's abroad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is largely the trade depths.</v>

31
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.400
<v Speaker 1>It's now twice as high as a percentage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the economy as it's ever been in</v>

32
00:02:55.991 --> 00:03:00.991
<v Speaker 1>America's history and we're borrowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and borrowing and becoming</v>

33
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>dysfunctionally and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>destructively,</v>

34
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>but depending on the long run on Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

35
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>in Japanese money in Asian money and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth and which they lend us money.</v>

36
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Funny thing about borrowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay it back at some time and</v>

37
00:03:24.181 --> 00:03:29.181
<v Speaker 1>as a country we can't continue to borrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>a seven percent of the whole economy,</v>

38
00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:35.190
<v Speaker 1>which is what we're borrowing now for</v>
<v Speaker 1>very many years without looking like a</v>

39
00:03:35.191 --> 00:03:40.191
<v Speaker 1>very different America than we have now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the economy today is in</v>

40
00:03:43.051 --> 00:03:46.140
<v Speaker 1>pretty good shape though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was getting pretty turbulent now with</v>

41
00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:49.860
<v Speaker 1>housing and housing is a wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

42
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.060
<v Speaker 1>I did quite a study about 18 months ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was simply astonished at the</v>

43
00:03:59.961 --> 00:04:04.070
<v Speaker 1>number of people who bought homes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no money down.</v>

44
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.340
<v Speaker 1>It's called interest on me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I was astonished that even</v>

45
00:04:10.971 --> 00:04:15.380
<v Speaker 1>though mortgage rates at the lowest</v>
<v Speaker 1>level in 30 years,</v>

46
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 1>they've averaged around nine point seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent or something like that and now</v>

47
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.180
<v Speaker 1>they're like six people are not taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm fixed mortgages.</v>

48
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.060
<v Speaker 1>About half of them are taking what are</v>
<v Speaker 1>called adjustable rate mortgages.</v>

49
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Well one might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gee,</v>

50
00:04:36.121 --> 00:04:39.810
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we have a lot of savings that we've</v>

51
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:44.811
<v Speaker 1>stacked away and if we aren't borrowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much for other purposes,</v>

52
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.010
<v Speaker 1>that isn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're borrowing more Maura's upset of</v>

53
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.860
<v Speaker 1>her income than we have in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years.</v>

54
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.060
<v Speaker 1>So now we've had this big blow out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the so called subprime mortgage market</v>

55
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.990
<v Speaker 1>and today I hear on the press that</v>
<v Speaker 1>housing prices are falling and so forth.</v>

56
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.120
<v Speaker 1>What did we think was gonna happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are these loans going to get paid</v>

57
00:05:12.121 --> 00:05:16.080
<v Speaker 1>back if we don't have any savings are</v>
<v Speaker 1>already heavily borrowed.</v>

58
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.190
<v Speaker 1>So my concerns about the economy of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country are much more in the future and</v>

59
00:05:23.341 --> 00:05:27.570
<v Speaker 1>much more of our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had become from one of the biggest</v>

60
00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:32.310
<v Speaker 1>savers and the world and saving remember</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a metaphor for the future,</v>

61
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've become the biggest consumers and</v>

62
00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:40.250
<v Speaker 1>borrowers in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of another way of saying,</v>

63
00:05:40.251 --> 00:05:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Dang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it all.</v>

64
00:05:41.221 --> 00:05:45.180
<v Speaker 1>I want it now and I don't want to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>up anything and kind of to hell with the</v>

65
00:05:45.181 --> 00:05:50.181
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I am a far more concerned with</v>

66
00:05:50.941 --> 00:05:53.460
<v Speaker 1>America's economic future 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

67
00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 1>20 years from now than I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens over the next months.</v>

68
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I am planning to</v>

69
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.150
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a from blackstone going public.</v>

70
00:06:07.151 --> 00:06:10.990
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it and it's quite a windfall</v>
<v Speaker 1>and set up a</v>

71
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.370
<v Speaker 1>what will turn out to be a very large</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation</v>

72
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.900
<v Speaker 1>and because I've been boring people</v>
<v Speaker 1>relentlessly for the last 20,</v>

73
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.330
<v Speaker 1>30 years about some of these problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

74
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take a number of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that are what I call</v>

75
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.870
<v Speaker 1>undeniable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an unsustainable and yet politically</v>

76
00:06:37.871 --> 00:06:42.871
<v Speaker 1>untouchable because of the political</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture we now live in where it's</v>

77
00:06:45.311 --> 00:06:49.900
<v Speaker 1>considered almost politically terminal</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever asked anybody to give up anything</v>

78
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.970
<v Speaker 1>or pay for anything and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want more and more and more and I,</v>

79
00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.570
<v Speaker 1>I want it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to take these issues which I think</v>

80
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.690
<v Speaker 1>are serious threat to America's future</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

81
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.150
<v Speaker 1>take those issues where there's a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>gap</v>

82
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.150
<v Speaker 1>between what we should be doing and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could be doing and what we are not</v>

83
00:07:16.151 --> 00:07:16.984
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

84
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.160
<v Speaker 1>And figure out how at the margin</v>
<v Speaker 1>a major foundation might be able to make</v>

85
00:07:26.531 --> 00:07:29.290
<v Speaker 1>a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I think of young people today and I</v>

86
00:07:29.291 --> 00:07:34.291
<v Speaker 1>think of what we're leaving them</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 10,</v>

87
00:07:34.451 --> 00:07:36.100
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years from now,</v>

88
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.900
<v Speaker 1>you remind me of that old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a joke in the philosophy class where the</v>

89
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.190
<v Speaker 1>professor asks the students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is worse,</v>

90
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.770
<v Speaker 1>ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance or apathy,</v>

91
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.770
<v Speaker 1>and some poor kid from the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>class says,</v>

92
00:07:53.771 --> 00:07:55.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't care.</v>

93
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an interesting question.</v>

94
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Is there an exciting way that we could</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the young people to this country</v>

95
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:11.070
<v Speaker 1>aware and their parents because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>refused to believe that parents have</v>

96
00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:16.510
<v Speaker 1>suddenly become cold and indifferent to</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own kids and grand computers.</v>

97
00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:21.511
<v Speaker 1>I think they've been deceived and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>misinformed and disinfect and so forth,</v>

98
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.880
<v Speaker 1>so we have a political system today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

99
00:08:27.881 --> 00:08:32.881
<v Speaker 1>where the elderly are unbelievably well</v>
<v Speaker 1>represented.</v>

100
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:38.490
<v Speaker 1>The American Association of Retired</v>
<v Speaker 1>Persons as 38 dues paying $38 million</v>

101
00:08:39.521 --> 00:08:42.160
<v Speaker 1>dues paying members.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They write more,</v>

102
00:08:42.161 --> 00:08:46.810
<v Speaker 1>they lobby more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call more and by and large it's not</v>

103
00:08:46.811 --> 00:08:50.260
<v Speaker 1>too unfair to say a lot of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>programs are.</v>

104
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 1>We want more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though by any standard,</v>

105
00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:57.720
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these challenges are</v>

106
00:08:57.721 --> 00:08:59.190
<v Speaker 1>unsustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't,</v>

107
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.930
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to be able to meet the</v>
<v Speaker 1>promises that we've made.</v>

108
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:09.010
<v Speaker 1>So on the one hand we have these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this culture of our ethic of shared</v>

109
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice being kind of a dirty word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not wanting to give up anything.</v>

110
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.910
<v Speaker 1>We have political organizations who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant in representing one age group</v>

111
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:28.170
<v Speaker 1>and the young people who were all about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future or somehow being slipped this</v>

112
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:33.561
<v Speaker 1>huge check</v>
<v Speaker 1>hidden check I might add for our free</v>

113
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:39.390
<v Speaker 1>lunch and nobody seems to be doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about it.</v>

114
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:45.200
<v Speaker 1>So I would like to gather together the</v>
<v Speaker 1>student and the young leaders of this</v>

115
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:51.360
<v Speaker 1>country and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a day or two and say,</v>

116
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:57.380
<v Speaker 1>try to give you the biggest best running</v>
<v Speaker 1>around I can and half a dozen areas of</v>

117
00:09:58.111 --> 00:10:01.530
<v Speaker 1>the economy and fiscally and what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world looks like.</v>

118
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.910
<v Speaker 1>And then I want you to contemplate that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not my future.</v>

119
00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:07.950
<v Speaker 1>It's yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 81 years old.</v>

120
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.970
<v Speaker 1>I Lord knows I don't need anything more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And ask you what are the best ways to do</v>

121
00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:20.181
<v Speaker 1>something about it and should we have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>American Association of young people and</v>

122
00:10:20.401 --> 00:10:21.810
<v Speaker 1>their parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

123
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:27.650
<v Speaker 1>because until this democracy gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>educated and get some form,</v>

124
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.160
<v Speaker 1>which is the first requirement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then get active and motivated.</v>

125
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Not much is going to happen on these</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems unless there's a huge crisis</v>

126
00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:43.440
<v Speaker 1>and it will be a very costly crisis when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hits.</v>

127
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.200
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a long winded answer how I feel</v>

128
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:52.410
<v Speaker 1>about the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I I'm much more concerned about the</v>

129
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.280
<v Speaker 1>longterm picture that I am over the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>year or two or three.</v>

130
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.960
<v Speaker 2>My parents' generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the greatest generation for</v>

131
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.240
<v Speaker 1>fought the most costly war in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Costly in every sense of that word.</v>

132
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.600
<v Speaker 1>They built international institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marshall Plan and so forth,</v>

133
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:20.630
<v Speaker 1>which was central to the world getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>restored.</v>

134
00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:27.540
<v Speaker 1>They had gi bill or rights for all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>returning veterans went to college.</v>

135
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.340
<v Speaker 1>They rebuild the infrastructure of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

136
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.420
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't ask me to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They paid for it because they were</v>

137
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:43.560
<v Speaker 1>willing to invest in the future and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>meant saving.</v>

138
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.860
<v Speaker 1>And that meant consuming less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell these university audiences,</v>

139
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:55.620
<v Speaker 1>I think a careful study of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>sociologist,</v>

140
00:11:55.661 --> 00:12:00.100
<v Speaker 1>of your social psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have your political scientists of your</v>

141
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:05.101
<v Speaker 1>economists have your historians and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it during those early times and</v>

142
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.840
<v Speaker 1>where more Americans than I'm afraid</v>
<v Speaker 1>today had a clear sense of the future</v>

143
00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:19.291
<v Speaker 1>and a responsibility for it and what led</v>
<v Speaker 1>us to this notion,</v>

144
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:24.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to grab what I can and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government owes me this and the</v>

145
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:29.941
<v Speaker 1>government owes me that and a kind of to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell with other people or to hell with</v>

146
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.610
<v Speaker 1>the future to hell with</v>
<v Speaker 1>who and how we're going to pay for all</v>

147
00:12:36.611 --> 00:12:38.140
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

148
00:12:38.141 --> 00:12:43.141
<v Speaker 1>why did that come about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What led to this boomer mentality?</v>

149
00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:43.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

150
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I wanted it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to enjoy it.</v>

151
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.270
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a dear friend who</v>

152
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.830
<v Speaker 1>is there an aspect of the medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>profession.</v>

153
00:12:53.831 --> 00:12:55.870
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of complaining that it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

154
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.143
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

155
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.580
<v Speaker 1>millionaire or mold omitted in her or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

156
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:04.911
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

157
00:13:04.911 --> 00:13:08.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one way people become millionaires is</v>

158
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.240
<v Speaker 1>they save and they invest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's got to have a smaller plane and</v>

159
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:20.030
<v Speaker 1>he flies on the weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he points out to me is not a jet,</v>

160
00:13:20.031 --> 00:13:20.601
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

161
00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:23.210
<v Speaker 1>I understand I don't have a jet either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

162
00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.040
<v Speaker 1>and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

163
00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to have fun because I worked so</v>

164
00:13:28.401 --> 00:13:33.260
<v Speaker 1>hard all week and I need a porsche car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:38.390
<v Speaker 1>so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is the boomer mentality that</v>

166
00:13:38.391 --> 00:13:43.391
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of dealing with here and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really know what lead from saving</v>

167
00:13:45.111 --> 00:13:49.040
<v Speaker 1>and investing into the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which consoling and borrowing.</v>

168
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

169
00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:56.260
<v Speaker 1>did America get a disenchanted by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam war?</v>

170
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.680
<v Speaker 1>The tore this country apart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did we get torn apart by the</v>

171
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:09.470
<v Speaker 1>fascination of presidents and</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents,</v>

172
00:14:09.471 --> 00:14:14.471
<v Speaker 1>brothers and Martin Luther King and</v>
<v Speaker 1>riots in the streets?</v>

173
00:14:16.881 --> 00:14:18.650
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

174
00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:23.030
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna say I was working on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem in Chicago is a terrifying side</v>

175
00:14:23.031 --> 00:14:28.031
<v Speaker 1>to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then somehow the bonds that united</v>

176
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.600
<v Speaker 1>us in Helios lead to the current</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

177
00:14:34.371 --> 00:14:39.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've never seen a time when there is</v>

178
00:14:39.231 --> 00:14:44.231
<v Speaker 1>so much bitterness and partisanship and</v>
<v Speaker 1>paralysis as we have today in our</v>

179
00:14:47.961 --> 00:14:48.890
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

180
00:14:48.891 --> 00:14:52.970
<v Speaker 1>nothing went through areas or areas</v>
<v Speaker 1>where</v>

181
00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:59.280
<v Speaker 1>the Republican leadership in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic leadership are united for a</v>

182
00:14:59.281 --> 00:15:03.480
<v Speaker 1>much longer larger cause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely the nation's interest.</v>

183
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.470
<v Speaker 1>We've had very little of that recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm putting.</v>

184
00:15:07.471 --> 00:15:10.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what all the reasons are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just know there's been a,</v>

185
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.690
<v Speaker 1>a really major shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if I may,</v>

186
00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:20.100
<v Speaker 1>just to insult your medium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it entirely possible that</v>

187
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:26.340
<v Speaker 1>television</v>
<v Speaker 1>has had its impact.</v>

188
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.930
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to watch my children,</v>

189
00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:35.931
<v Speaker 1>I admire there wasn't television</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they turn on the TV</v>

190
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:42.740
<v Speaker 1>and pounded into their heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's this toy.</v>

191
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:44.840
<v Speaker 1>They had a habit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the stress.</v>

192
00:15:44.841 --> 00:15:49.070
<v Speaker 1>They gotta have this and we've developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of a</v>

193
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:55.600
<v Speaker 1>indulgent instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gratification consumption,</v>

194
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.580
<v Speaker 1>large s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

195
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.820
<v Speaker 1>that has become part of our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't,</v>

196
00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:02.900
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

197
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:08.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know all the reasons for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly the presence of such an</v>

198
00:16:08.481 --> 00:16:11.180
<v Speaker 1>effective medium and television is</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably one of the,</v>

199
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.360
<v Speaker 1>uh.</v>
