1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.480
<v Speaker 1>So space x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.090
<v Speaker 1>is a response to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of space exploration.</v>

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>This is my point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the magical things about NASA</v>

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.640
<v Speaker 1>national and Space Administration here</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the US is the administration has</v>

5
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>stayed about the same for 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1958.</v>

6
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty six years.</v>

7
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.100
<v Speaker 1>The reason is congress had the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either the ignorance or the genius to</v>

8
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:39.711
<v Speaker 1>put a dozen NASA centers in 12 different</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 13 different places around the US.</v>

9
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>And when you try to close a NASA center</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Congress,</v>

10
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 1>people come unglued and you can't close</v>
<v Speaker 1>a NASA center.</v>

11
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.980
<v Speaker 1>This is how people got to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>when John Kennedy was shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was an awful thing,</v>

13
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.670
<v Speaker 1>any idea to cancel the moon program was</v>
<v Speaker 1>squashed as soon as Kennedy was shot,</v>

14
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't not not go as the expression</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>

15
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.600
<v Speaker 1>So humans went to the moon space program</v>
<v Speaker 1>existed,</v>

16
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 1>changed the world and a great way A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

17
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 1>it made things expensive.</v>

18
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 1>When you build rocket engines in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alabama,</v>

19
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.080
<v Speaker 1>you and you get the fuel from Utah and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you test them in Mississippi and you</v>

20
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:32.661
<v Speaker 1>then send them to Florida and control</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that from Texas with some drop</v>

21
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:38.280
<v Speaker 1>testing done in Cleveland and all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

22
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>material science resources,</v>

23
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.390
<v Speaker 1>so on done in California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some flight tests done in the desert of</v>

24
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do all that,</v>

25
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>you just add cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go to space x,</v>

26
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.090
<v Speaker 1>the material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stainless steel and the aluminum</v>

27
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>come off the train cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes through the factory like this.</v>

28
00:01:57.061 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 1>We make our tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we make our space frame or airframe.</v>

29
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>We make our rocket engine bells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We make our,</v>

30
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>we hook up our plumbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes back this way,</v>

31
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:11.061
<v Speaker 1>we do the wiring and it gets back on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>train car and goes to either Vandenberg</v>

32
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Air Force Base or Cape Canaveral or some</v>
<v Speaker 1>other place because it's all made in one</v>

33
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:15.714
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

34
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.990
<v Speaker 1>But the way NASA was established in</v>
<v Speaker 1>1958,</v>

35
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>it's not set up that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was good and bad.</v>

36
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.140
<v Speaker 1>So it is to be hoped that space x Sierra</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevada space a blue origins,</v>

37
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 1>that these companies will emerge and</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower the cost,</v>

38
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>especially if taking stuff to low earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>orbit.</v>

39
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Keep in mind everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all the free market</v>

40
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go laissez faire people.</v>

41
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Space X has taken at least half a</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars,</v>

42
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>$500,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars from NASA because NASA</v>

43
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>wants to develop this capability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you buy an atlas five rocket or a</v>

44
00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Delta for rocket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those commercially made gizmos and so is</v>

45
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:07.411
<v Speaker 1>going to be the Falcon Falcon heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are commercial rockets and NASA</v>

46
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>has gone to great lengths to develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>that business.</v>

47
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>

48
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>I would go to space like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I applied to be an astronaut four times.</v>

49
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to get a view of the earth</v>

50
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:22.174
<v Speaker 1>from space.</v>

51
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.660
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now the price is $200,000.</v>

52
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Starts to come down into the 10th of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

53
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could imagine doing it if you've never</v>

54
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>jumped out of a plane with a parachute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is cool.</v>

55
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it full time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I get it.</v>

56
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>It's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you do see the world in a new way</v>

57
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 1>and you're in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's dream is to be able to fly.</v>

58
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>You're flying for a few moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

59
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see how people get hooked on that.</v>

60
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 1>And I think space exploration would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same deal.</v>
