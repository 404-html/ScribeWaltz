1
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.540
<v Speaker 1>I think the European Union is superbly</v>
<v Speaker 1>positioned to become a major player in</v>

2
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>the 21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.830
<v Speaker 1>and it has done quite well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>the common currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.993
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 1>centralization necessary centralization</v>
<v Speaker 1>coordination through European law,</v>

7
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>European courts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.820
<v Speaker 1>have done a great deal of good to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>continent that was divided.</v>

9
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so along I think Europe faces two</v>

10
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>fundamental challenges that are very</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to overcome.</v>

11
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.570
<v Speaker 1>The first challenge is the demographic</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge and gray and continent,</v>

12
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe is growing much faster than the</v>

13
00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:51.081
<v Speaker 1>United States is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Europe has to deal with that</v>

14
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:53.270
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

15
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>that means that not only there are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who want to retire and,</v>

16
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get up state pension.</v>

17
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>That means that every year you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 2 million people that are missing</v>

18
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>in the workforce because they retire and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to replenish them.</v>

19
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2 million,</v>

20
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 1>that means 2 million immigrants from</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

21
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't a country close to Europe,</v>

22
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>large enough to supply to a million</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants a year,</v>

23
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>let alone the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question of cohesion of integrating</v>

24
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:27.201
<v Speaker 1>these people into the European culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Europe has in faces a huge challenge,</v>

25
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more so than the United States do.</v>

26
00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:31.680
<v Speaker 1>You had a challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course is.</v>

27
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the beauty of the United</v>

28
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The beauty of the United States is that</v>

29
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it pushes itself to the brink,</v>

30
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.380
<v Speaker 1>but it never falls off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

31
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.450
<v Speaker 1>once it's at the brink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even extremely close to it then comes</v>

32
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>and it retains its unique spirit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship and innovativeness.</v>

34
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe needs to,</v>

35
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin to harness that and begin to</v>

36
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>belief in its own ability to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial,</v>

37
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:05.220
<v Speaker 1>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and innovative,</v>

38
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to believe in itself.</v>

39
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.200
<v Speaker 1>So far it hasn't done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still always eyeing towards the</v>

40
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I think a little bit more self</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence would do it good.</v>
