00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.170
<v Speaker 1>The digital economy is breaking things</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most people running digital</v>

2
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:16.311
<v Speaker 1>companies aren't aware of the operating</v>
<v Speaker 1>system that's beneath what they're</v>

3
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:24.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a good old fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.420
<v Speaker 1>venture capital driven operating system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.760
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to central currency and</v>

7
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>corporatism and chartered monopolies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>really the way our economy works,</v>

8
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>which has worked for a good four or 500</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and promoted everything from the</v>

9
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>British east India trading company right</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the Walmart and General</v>

10
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Electric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you take that and juice it up</v>

11
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>with digital steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird things start to happen.</v>

12
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up able to tweak and optimize</v>

13
00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:02.601
<v Speaker 1>your business so carefully that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>really see is it growing,</v>

14
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>is it not growing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can we do to promote growth,</v>

15
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 1>growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth.</v>

16
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>And if your company's not growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up in big trouble against all</v>

17
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>the other players that are growing.</v>

18
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's simple a power law dynamics.</v>

19
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a winner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Takes all landscape.</v>

20
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a company like twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I would see in my old fashioned</v>

21
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:29.061
<v Speaker 1>view as a successful company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes $500 million a quarter based on</v>

22
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>140 character APP success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

23
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the current environment,</v>

24
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:39.150
<v Speaker 1>that's a failure because they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a growth strategy.</v>

25
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>They don't know how to turn into a video</v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

26
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 1>a news company as social company than</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything company.</v>

27
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.740
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why the digital economy</v>
<v Speaker 1>is breaking our businesses is because</v>

28
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:57.171
<v Speaker 1>we're taking the old agenda of growth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and running it on digital platforms and</v>

29
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:03.021
<v Speaker 1>it ends up amplifying and spinning this</v>
<v Speaker 1>priority out of control.</v>

30
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Most of us look at the industrial age as</v>
<v Speaker 1>this natural outgrowth of the need to do</v>

31
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>more and better business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as I researched it,</v>

32
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I found out that most of the innovations</v>
<v Speaker 1>we came up with in the industrial age</v>

33
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:23.091
<v Speaker 1>where really for the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a thriving peer to peer</v>

34
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.400
<v Speaker 1>economy right at the end of the Middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ages that nobody likes to talk about.</v>

35
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.890
<v Speaker 1>The soldiers had come back from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crusades.</v>

36
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>They had all sorts of new inventions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies and mechanisms.</v>

37
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Speaker 1>They were new trade routes that they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>opened up and they came back to their</v>

38
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:43.080
<v Speaker 1>towns and they took something that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>found in the Middle East called the</v>

39
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>bizarre and they revived it as something</v>
<v Speaker 1>they called the marketplace.</v>

40
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Speaker 1>So now people who had just been peasants</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on the land of the Lords started</v>

41
00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>coming together and trading the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they made.</v>

42
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>And they had all of these really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting instruments from market and</v>

43
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:04.621
<v Speaker 1>local currency and grain based currency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of these evolved really to</v>

44
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:09.991
<v Speaker 1>promote the exchange of value when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>velocity of transactions between people</v>

45
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>and it started to really do well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the problem.</v>

46
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>As the peasants became wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aristocracy got scared.</v>

47
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Who are these people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to be dependent on us</v>

48
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

49
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.040
<v Speaker 1>So they came up with two main financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovations to prevent the rise of this</v>

50
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 1>peer to peer economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one was the chartered</v>

51
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really the parent to the modern</v>

52
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the chartered monopoly was,</v>

53
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>was a way to say all of you small</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses are now illegal.</v>

54
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be in the shoe business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to work for His Majesty's Royal</v>

55
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Shoe Company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be in the grain business,</v>

56
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>you'll have to work for His Majesty's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Royal Grain Company.</v>

57
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.410
<v Speaker 1>So people who were small business people</v>
<v Speaker 1>now became employees instead of selling</v>

58
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 1>the value they created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they sold their time as servants,</v>

59
00:03:56.981 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>as wage laborers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second invention they came up with</v>

60
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 1>was central currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not such a terrible thing in itself.</v>

61
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>It's great to have a long distance</v>
<v Speaker 1>currency that lots of people can use and</v>

62
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem was they made all of the</v>

63
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 1>local currencies illegal.</v>

64
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>So the only way people could trade with</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

65
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>the candlestick maker could trade with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chicken farmer,</v>

66
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 1>was by borrowing central currency from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the treasury.</v>

67
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>So now you had to borrow money at</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest just in order to transact.</v>

68
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.060
<v Speaker 1>And that set in motion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really a growth cascade.</v>

69
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.270
<v Speaker 1>If you have a currency that has to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid back with interest in order to just</v>

70
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.370
<v Speaker 1>to meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make ends meet,</v>

71
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 1>you need an economy that's growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need more money next year.</v>

72
00:04:46.331 --> 00:04:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Then there was this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that worked well for colonial powers.</v>

73
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>As long as we can extend into Africa and</v>
<v Speaker 1>South America and North America,</v>

74
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 1>find slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find new resources we could grow.</v>

75
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>But what happens when you reach the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the planet's growth as we did really</v>

76
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:05.620
<v Speaker 1>at the end of World War II?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then we started to look for really</v>

77
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 1>virtual surface area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some new way to grow and that was</v>

78
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:10.834
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

79
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>We believed that digital technology in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worldwide web and computers would</v>

80
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:20.140
<v Speaker 1>really create a new place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new virtual territory for us to</v>

81
00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 1>colonize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just turns out what we've been</v>

82
00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 1>colonizing for the last 20 years is</v>
<v Speaker 1>human attention and human time.</v>

83
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.230
<v Speaker 1>And now it looks like we're even running</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of that.</v>

84
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Or when the Internet first emerged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like me thought,</v>

85
00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Hooray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're going to have a way to restore</v>

86
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 1>all that peer to peer connectivity</v>
<v Speaker 1>between people.</v>

87
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.550
<v Speaker 1>And some of the earliest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

88
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Internet businesses actually sought to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that in one way or another.</v>

89
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.750
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the path of Ebay and</v>
<v Speaker 1>paypal and etsy and square,</v>

90
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 1>there aren't a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of businesses that are</v>

91
00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>looking at how can we connect people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lateral way.</v>

92
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Problem is as those businesses grew and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody got interested in the net,</v>

93
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.480
<v Speaker 1>other folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the folks who really who,</v>

94
00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 1>who started wired magazine or the global</v>
<v Speaker 1>business network,</v>

95
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 1>a lot of folks who were from the old</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nasdaq Stock Exchange,</v>

96
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:18.280
<v Speaker 1>which had been really depleted ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the uh,</v>

97
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.320
<v Speaker 1>biotech crash of 1987 they saw in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet a new avenue for growth.</v>

98
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 1>So for them it wasn't about how are we</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to connect people in new wonderful</v>

99
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:29.990
<v Speaker 1>ways and let them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

100
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>create an exchange value between them.</v>

101
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.850
<v Speaker 1>It was really more how can we use</v>
<v Speaker 1>digital platforms to extract value from</v>

102
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:40.970
<v Speaker 1>people in places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you compare an Ebay,</v>

103
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 1>which is promoting exchange to an</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon,</v>

104
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 1>which is promoting extraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of begin to see the</v>

105
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:51.650
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is you end up with digital</v>

106
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:56.651
<v Speaker 1>businesses that really are started more</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the flip this house model of</v>

107
00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:00.980
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm going to start a business that</v>

108
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 1>helps people and keeps going for 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

109
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 1>People put money into an internet</v>
<v Speaker 1>business in order to get to acquisition</v>

110
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 1>or IPO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to grow this business a</v>

111
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:14.990
<v Speaker 1>hundred times and then get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called an exit strategy.</v>

112
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Then it doesn't matter what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a ride sharing company,</v>

113
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 1>are you going to pay your drivers enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that they can have an ecosystem that</v>

114
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 1>lasts 20 years?</v>

115
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't care about that.</v>

116
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.030
<v Speaker 1>You can adopt a scorched earth policy</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards this because you only need those</v>

117
00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:36.380
<v Speaker 1>drivers and that whole ride sharing</v>
<v Speaker 1>sector long enough to establish a</v>

118
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:39.410
<v Speaker 1>monopoly and then move over into</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

119
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 1>When the Internet came around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all thought we're all going to get to</v>

120
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:44.960
<v Speaker 1>work at home in our underwear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our own time,</v>

121
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:49.190
<v Speaker 1>exchanging value with one another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead we've ended up with an</v>

122
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:53.750
<v Speaker 1>internet that takes more time from us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an Internet that we feel exhausted and</v>

123
00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:58.070
<v Speaker 1>drained when we're done using it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because we're not using it.</v>

124
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.200
<v Speaker 1>It's using us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These.</v>

125
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:05.230
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is really just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>technological front on a whole series of</v>

126
00:08:05.841 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 1>business plans that are looking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>extract money from us,</v>

127
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:10.760
<v Speaker 1>time from us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention from us,</v>

128
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.830
<v Speaker 1>and if we have none of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least data from us and we're not</v>

129
00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:19.130
<v Speaker 1>feeling it creating value for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not feeling,</v>

130
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:23.570
<v Speaker 1>it really enhanced our ability to create</v>
<v Speaker 1>an exchange value with other people.</v>

131
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 1>It's harder for most of us to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>living now rather than easier,</v>

132
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.790
<v Speaker 1>and that's not because automation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing things better.</v>

133
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.890
<v Speaker 1>It's because we're really facing very</v>
<v Speaker 1>extractive business plans,</v>

134
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:42.310
<v Speaker 1>extensions of that very same late</v>
<v Speaker 1>medieval squashing of peer to peer</v>

135
00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:45.980
<v Speaker 1>activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although now amplified in every device</v>

136
00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:50.981
<v Speaker 1>in our arsenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I'm optimistic is because the</v>

137
00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:56.921
<v Speaker 1>metrics are all on the side doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>business well rather than this scorched</v>

138
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short term extractive model that most</v>

139
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 1>digital companies use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the data,</v>

140
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 1>family businesses do better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>shareholder owned businesses on every</v>

141
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 1>single metric except one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They grow slower during bubbles.</v>

142
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.030
<v Speaker 1>And actually you kind of want to want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow slower during bubbles because if</v>

143
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:20.370
<v Speaker 1>you grow big during a bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're part of what pops.</v>

144
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why family businesses do</v>

145
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:27.090
<v Speaker 1>better in the long run than shareholder</v>
<v Speaker 1>owned businesses is because the person</v>

146
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:28.330
<v Speaker 1>running a share,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

147
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 1>the person running a family business</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants it to be around in another</v>

148
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 1>generation or two or three.</v>

149
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:38.400
<v Speaker 1>The person running a shareholder owned</v>
<v Speaker 1>business wants to extract enough money</v>

150
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:43.200
<v Speaker 1>from that business so their grandchild</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be given this wad of cash.</v>

151
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:47.460
<v Speaker 1>The person with a family business wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>the business to be healthy enough so the</v>

152
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:50.970
<v Speaker 1>grandchild can then run a successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>thriving business.</v>

153
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.790
<v Speaker 1>And because your family name is on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

154
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.050
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do really mean things</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your employees or do the places where</v>

155
00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:01.050
<v Speaker 1>you operate because then people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to hate your family.</v>

156
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your name,</v>

157
00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:04.110
<v Speaker 1>it's your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a very,</v>

158
00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very different dynamic gets set up in</v>

159
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 1>one that's ultimately more sustainable</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a business.</v>

160
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:15.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and startup founders of startups and</v>

161
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.040
<v Speaker 1>technology businesses have to come to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that taking venture capital</v>

162
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.520
<v Speaker 1>and going for the big acquisition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going for that one out of 10,000 chance</v>

163
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.920
<v Speaker 1>of getting a home run is dumb compared</v>
<v Speaker 1>to taking a very small amount of money</v>

164
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.860
<v Speaker 1>and hitting the single or the double.</v>

165
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.720
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making 10 or $20 million is not tragic.</v>

166
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.090
<v Speaker 1>It's still enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can still really,</v>

167
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.090
<v Speaker 1>you'll going to get by on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be able to send your</v>

168
00:10:48.091 --> 00:10:53.091
<v Speaker 1>kids to great colleges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a failure to have millions of</v>

169
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.880
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you have to aim for the billions,</v>

170
00:10:56.881 --> 00:11:00.900
<v Speaker 1>if you are forced to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your probability is so low.</v>

171
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:06.220
<v Speaker 1>You know when I look at these founders</v>
<v Speaker 1>running to sequoia and flat iron and y</v>

172
00:11:06.631 --> 00:11:09.870
<v Speaker 1>combinator cause they want to go big and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the home run,</v>

173
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:14.310
<v Speaker 1>it looks to me like those people you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking their welfare checks and going to</v>

174
00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:18.930
<v Speaker 1>the Bodega and buying lottery tickets</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they want to get the jackpot.</v>

175
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.680
<v Speaker 1>The 43 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no chance of doing that and</v>

176
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.000
<v Speaker 1>they would have a chance of taking their</v>
<v Speaker 1>five or $10 and actually investing it</v>

177
00:11:27.001 --> 00:11:29.310
<v Speaker 1>and buy a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn how to do something,</v>

178
00:11:29.311 --> 00:11:30.144
<v Speaker 1>get a job.</v>

179
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:35.210
<v Speaker 1>They have a much more high probability</v>
<v Speaker 1>of succeeding and it just breaks my</v>

180
00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:40.200
<v Speaker 1>heart when I see a kid have a great app,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great idea,</v>

181
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.850
<v Speaker 1>and then they turn to a venture</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalist who gives them a ton of money</v>

182
00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:48.960
<v Speaker 1>in a high valuation and then has them</v>
<v Speaker 1>pivot.</v>

183
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:55.040
<v Speaker 1>The pivot is not to do something better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All a pivot means is you're going to</v>

184
00:11:56.141 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 1>abandon what your original business was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to come up with something</v>

185
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 1>that's sellable to the next round of</v>
<v Speaker 1>investors,</v>

186
00:12:04.271 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 1>the next ground of suckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

187
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>and do you really want to throw away</v>
<v Speaker 1>your business?</v>

188
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:13.951
<v Speaker 1>Do you really want to dispose of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea in order to turn it into the the</v>

189
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.920
<v Speaker 1>brand name on a Ponzi scheme?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

190
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.820
<v Speaker 1>I hope not because there's still so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>great things we can do with these</v>

191
00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:24.520
<v Speaker 1>technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much money to be made.</v>

192
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.510
<v Speaker 1>There's so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much revenue in creating</v>

193
00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:31.900
<v Speaker 1>people to one another and helping people</v>
<v Speaker 1>create an exchange value.</v>

194
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mantra I would give any startup and</v>

195
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:38.260
<v Speaker 1>any big business is make other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich.</v>

196
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.710
<v Speaker 1>If you make your users rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will come back.</v>

197
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 1>If you make them poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've killed your marketplace.</v>
