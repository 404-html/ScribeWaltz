00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I think there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some interesting faces,</v>

2
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.873
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 2>where people get it wrong and we know</v>
<v Speaker 2>why they got it wrong.</v>

4
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.340
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this often occurs in the case when</v>

5
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 2>you have very distinctive items.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is one of the things that</v>

6
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:36.040
<v Speaker 2>once you kind of get expert at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to watch out for cause it</v>

7
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 2>cause as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>

8
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:39.330
<v Speaker 2>what we're looking for is we're looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>for patterns.</v>

9
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 2>We're looking for overall patterns and</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are distinctive by,</v>

10
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 2>by nature of being distinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're inconsistent with a patent,</v>

11
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 2>but they'd draw your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we went into one of the rooms,</v>

12
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 2>we went into everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>indicated it was a socially responsible</v>

13
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 2>person who was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

14
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 2>a nice person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

15
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.530
<v Speaker 2>they were um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

16
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>organized and together and um,</v>

17
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that reckless.</v>

18
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 2>We are pretty sort of conservative in</v>
<v Speaker 2>many ways.</v>

19
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Yet in the corner of the room there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a plastic crate full of drug</v>

20
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 2>paraphernalia or a bong for smoking</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana and stuff like that.</v>

21
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.420
<v Speaker 2>And of course the judges come in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they see that which sticks out and they</v>

22
00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:27.390
<v Speaker 2>go straight over to it and I likely to</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpret it,</v>

23
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make,</v>

24
00:01:27.941 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 2>draw strong inferences from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

25
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:34.710
<v Speaker 2>the very reason that makes it stick out</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the very reason they should have</v>

26
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 2>ignored it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out when I later found out</v>

27
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:37.910
<v Speaker 2>what was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was,</v>

28
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 2>what was it doing there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that this person was</v>

29
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:42.300
<v Speaker 2>holding onto the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

30
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a roommate had gone traveling</v>

31
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:46.630
<v Speaker 2>around the world and tech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you look after this stuff's good?</v>

32
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

33
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Speaker 2>I'll put it on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She put it responsibly,</v>

34
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 2>put it in a crate and put it in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>corner of the room.</v>

35
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.811
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

36
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:52.644
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

37
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.020
<v Speaker 3>it was consistent with above 90,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not in the way you were thinking.</v>
