1
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2
00:00:07.131 --> 00:00:12.131
<v Speaker 1>I guess the hard lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secularism is not a good idea.</v>

3
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not to say that secularism is</v>

4
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.150
<v Speaker 1>not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5
00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:17.770
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

6
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 1>I certainly think that the attempt in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States to buy groups here to</v>

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.690
<v Speaker 1>rewrite American history as a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian story and to portray the</v>

8
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:31.370
<v Speaker 1>founding fathers as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

9
00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:34.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian fathers is something that</v>

10
00:00:34.371 --> 00:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>really needs to be challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

11
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.900
<v Speaker 1>and in the name of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of secular in the name of history,</v>

12
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.660
<v Speaker 1>but accurate history as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

13
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.580
<v Speaker 1>But I think the kind of hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no secularism of France that kind of,</v>

14
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbending insistence on,</v>

15
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that secular means one thing and that</v>

16
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.550
<v Speaker 1>violations of it are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will not be tolerated in any way is a</v>

17
00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 1>bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.010
<v Speaker 1>and that if you're accommodating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

19
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.680
<v Speaker 1>different groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different populations,</v>

20
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you need to do is figure out ways</v>

21
00:01:12.981 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>of accommodating them.</v>

22
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.020
<v Speaker 1>The way the French did when they passed</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1905 loss separating church and</v>

23
00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:19.910
<v Speaker 1>state the way they did with the Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 1>church.</v>

24
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.970
<v Speaker 1>There was a day off for religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>instruction for kids.</v>

25
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.290
<v Speaker 1>All the holidays in France still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some are state holidays,</v>

26
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:29.840
<v Speaker 1>but most of them are Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even just Christian Catholic</v>

27
00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 1>holidays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

28
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.030
<v Speaker 1>parts of France are Alsace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Lorraine Alsace Moselle those</v>

29
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:39.530
<v Speaker 1>departments which were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

30
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker 1>under German control when the 1905 law</v>
<v Speaker 1>was passed and then came back to France</v>

31
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 1>after the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those con,</v>

32
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.160
<v Speaker 1>those areas were never forced to adopt</v>
<v Speaker 1>the secular practices that the rest of</v>

33
00:01:56.691 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.080
<v Speaker 1>adopted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So still in those areas,</v>

35
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:02.080
<v Speaker 1>you can have religious teaching in</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>

36
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.880
<v Speaker 1>children have to take a course in</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious instruction and so on and so</v>

37
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:07.790
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they're not even consistent,</v>

38
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.050
<v Speaker 1>it's not even a nationally consistent</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy in relation to Catholicism,</v>

39
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.680
<v Speaker 1>which was the dominant religion at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time the law was passed.</v>

40
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.370
<v Speaker 1>So to act as if it's either secularism</v>
<v Speaker 1>or nothing,</v>

41
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.250
<v Speaker 1>or that the secular and the religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in eternal opposition to each other</v>

42
00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:33.251
<v Speaker 1>is to misrepresent French history and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create a situation in which they will</v>

43
00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:38.010
<v Speaker 1>only be a greater sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>felt discrimination and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.050
<v Speaker 1>anger on the part of the population's</v>
<v Speaker 1>whom these these laws affect.</v>

46
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

47
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that that kind of hard</v>

48
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.110
<v Speaker 1>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secularism,</v>

49
00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:56.111
<v Speaker 1>which is as fundamentalist in its way as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most extreme Islam Islamist</v>

50
00:02:56.871 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalism is defeats its own</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose and really doesn't,</v>

51
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up producing a situation in which</v>

52
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>there can be a certain kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pluralism,</v>

53
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.440
<v Speaker 1>cultural pluralism and political</v>
<v Speaker 1>assimilation and political citizenship.</v>
