00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Everything really kind of depends on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>budget.</v>

2
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.660
<v Speaker 1>If Congress passes adequate</v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriations for the war,</v>

3
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the new fiscal year beginning in</v>

4
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>October,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of how angry they are,</v>

5
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.440
<v Speaker 1>regardless of how much verbiage shows up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the congressional record or in the</v>

6
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>statute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.140
<v Speaker 1>and Petraeus has given a reasonably free</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand for another year,</v>

8
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>I think the chance of exiting with some</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree of stability might be fairly</v>

9
00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that doesn't happen,</v>

10
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the forces in the field are crippled</v>

11
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>by appropriations cuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be very bad from the point of</v>

13
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.620
<v Speaker 1>view of either being able to prevail</v>
<v Speaker 1>over a okayed in Iraq or,</v>

14
00:01:02.621 --> 00:01:03.454
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>being able to leave any kind of a stable</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation behind.</v>
