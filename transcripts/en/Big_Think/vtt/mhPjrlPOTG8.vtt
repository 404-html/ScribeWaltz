1
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.313
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.960
<v Speaker 2>I really see twitter and facebook to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly lesser extent,</v>

3
00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:12.920
<v Speaker 2>but really twitter as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.030
<v Speaker 2>routing devices for human attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.330
<v Speaker 2>they're very good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're effectively providing our</v>

6
00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:24.331
<v Speaker 2>species with a common nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we can use to transmit signals to</v>

7
00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:26.830
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when there's something that,</v>

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a very provocative or disturbing</v>

9
00:00:30.251 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Speaker 2>signal or a beautiful signal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

10
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.430
<v Speaker 2>it's a great system to get a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans attention directed at that thing</v>

11
00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very quickly.</v>

12
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.950
<v Speaker 2>And that can actually happen in a matter</v>
<v Speaker 2>of moments.</v>

13
00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Now our minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as routing devices,</v>

14
00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:43.420
<v Speaker 2>twitter and facebook are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are incredibly effective.</v>

15
00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:46.810
<v Speaker 2>And I think they do that very elegantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's self expressive mediums.</v>

16
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 2>They're less elegant and I actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think they're designed to be self</v>

17
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:54.220
<v Speaker 2>expressive mediums in the same way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>a blank piece of paper and a pen is</v>

18
00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:55.870
<v Speaker 2>designed to be a self expressive medium.</v>

19
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.880
<v Speaker 2>And so when I think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 2>like cowbird and how it relates to</v>
<v Speaker 2>services like twitter and facebook,</v>

21
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.540
<v Speaker 2>I really see twitter and facebook is</v>
<v Speaker 2>routing devices that can route attention</v>

22
00:01:04.541 --> 00:01:09.040
<v Speaker 2>to experiences and cowbird stories more</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the experiences themselves.</v>

23
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.230
<v Speaker 2>I had noticed a few trends happening in</v>
<v Speaker 2>online culture in general but also just</v>

24
00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:16.810
<v Speaker 2>in culture more generally over the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>few years.</v>

25
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.170
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were really four that sort of</v>

26
00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:22.060
<v Speaker 2>struck me that as things that I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

27
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.850
<v Speaker 2>to transform it to reverse a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

28
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.030
<v Speaker 2>the first one is compression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

29
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.090
<v Speaker 2>one thing we've seen actually predating</v>
<v Speaker 2>the web but accentuated with the web is</v>

30
00:01:33.131 --> 00:01:36.940
<v Speaker 2>the compressing and shortening and</v>
<v Speaker 2>speeding up of communication.</v>

31
00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:38.620
<v Speaker 2>So you can go back to like letter</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>

32
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.190
<v Speaker 2>which gave way to a eventually telephone</v>
<v Speaker 2>calls,</v>

33
00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:45.130
<v Speaker 2>which then gateway to faxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which then gave way to emails,</v>

34
00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 2>which then gave way to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

35
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.550
<v Speaker 2>text messages and chats and tweets.</v>

36
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.750
<v Speaker 2>And each successive level gets like more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more compressed and shorter and</v>

37
00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:55.660
<v Speaker 2>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're sort of like hovering at the</v>

38
00:01:55.661 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Speaker 2>tweet right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was unclear to me that there's</v>

39
00:01:58.541 --> 00:02:01.930
<v Speaker 2>another level of compression after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There may be as one more like maybe we</v>

40
00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:03.520
<v Speaker 2>start grunting at each other or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

41
00:02:03.521 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

42
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.730
<v Speaker 2>we've pretty much hit a kind of terminal</v>
<v Speaker 2>velocity,</v>

43
00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:07.570
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

44
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.640
<v Speaker 2>in terms of how fast communication can</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

45
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.220
<v Speaker 2>So then you ask the question like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens after that?</v>

46
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.240
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

47
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.270
<v Speaker 2>do we continue to do that mode or do we</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit some kind of wall and bounce back in</v>

48
00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:20.560
<v Speaker 2>the other direction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm craving a little more depth and</v>

49
00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:23.410
<v Speaker 2>substance again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I was betting on that happening</v>

50
00:02:23.411 --> 00:02:25.060
<v Speaker 2>and wanting to help that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

51
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this first trend of compression,</v>

52
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

53
00:02:28.811 --> 00:02:30.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was interested in transforming into a</v>

54
00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:32.920
<v Speaker 2>kind of deepening a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily a lengthening,</v>

55
00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 2>because I think that our brain chemistry</v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually different now.</v>

56
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.180
<v Speaker 2>And you cannot expect a large portion of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet to sit down and read a 500</v>

57
00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:44.080
<v Speaker 2>page novel anymore or even go to watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>an opera for three hours anymore.</v>

58
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Some people will do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those are not the mediums that are</v>

59
00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:48.670
<v Speaker 2>going to resonate most broadly with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

60
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.940
<v Speaker 2>the human species right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think you have to understand the</v>

61
00:02:51.941 --> 00:02:55.600
<v Speaker 2>time you're living in and what are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most resonant mediums of that time.</v>

62
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.350
<v Speaker 2>And then designed to those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Related to that was the second trend had</v>

63
00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 2>noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a kind of a disposability like</v>

64
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the stuff that we put out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the world as individuals,</v>

65
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 2>we have this sort of complicit</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding that it's going to be</v>

66
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:15.901
<v Speaker 2>swollen up and replaced moments after we</v>
<v Speaker 2>publish it by the torrent of new stuff</v>

67
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 2>that comes after it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this sense of just,</v>

68
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.963
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

69
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 2>expressing yourself in a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>disposable way that,</v>

70
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't have any sort of lasting impact.</v>

71
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 2>This was very different from something I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had experienced when I was younger,</v>

72
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 2>when I was a lot younger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I was working more with</v>

73
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 2>physical art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to keep these incredibly</v>

74
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 2>meticulous sketchbooks filled with</v>
<v Speaker 2>plants and ticket stubs and um,</v>

75
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.490
<v Speaker 2>dead insects and watercolor paintings</v>
<v Speaker 2>and writings and all of this stuff.</v>

76
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 2>They were like this sort of living</v>
<v Speaker 2>testimony of my life every day.</v>

77
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 2>And they were incredibly time consuming</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make,</v>

78
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 2>but each time you added a page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it got more and more beautiful.</v>

79
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 2>The overall thing got more and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>

80
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 2>And over the course of years you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>have these incredibly meaningful objects</v>

81
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 2>that are kind of a mirror of your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your lived experience.</v>

82
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.790
<v Speaker 2>And so that kind of timelessness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

83
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 2>that slowly building something over</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

84
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 2>which becomes more and more beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 2>over time.</v>

85
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.960
<v Speaker 2>I had never had that feeling on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>

86
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.360
<v Speaker 2>like everything on the Internet was</v>
<v Speaker 2>always about the moment,</v>

87
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 2>but not even in the kind of like new</v>
<v Speaker 2>agey Buddhist sense of being very</v>

88
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just more in terms of novelty,</v>

89
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 2>like what's new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the latest,</v>

90
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:21.700
<v Speaker 2>what's the latest?</v>

91
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I was interested in taking that,</v>

92
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of disposability and trying to</v>

93
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 2>transform it and do a and do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>timelessness.</v>

94
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 2>The third major trend I noticed was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>curation.</v>

95
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.890
<v Speaker 2>So people were increasingly expressing</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves through the stuff that they</v>

96
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:40.430
<v Speaker 2>thought was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

97
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 2>so there are web services like pinterest</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Tumblr.</v>

98
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 2>And twitter and facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which have,</v>

99
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really encouraged this type of self</v>

100
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 2>expression in our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot easier than creating things</v>

101
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 2>directly to assemble lists is easier</v>
<v Speaker 2>than to come up with original stuff.</v>

102
00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:57.450
<v Speaker 2>And so I noticed that a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

103
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 2>self expression online was taking the</v>
<v Speaker 2>form of curation.</v>

104
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.250
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like walking into someone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment and like judging them by what</v>

105
00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:04.840
<v Speaker 2>they have hanging on their walls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

106
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.750
<v Speaker 2>and sort of talking to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was interested in taking this</v>

107
00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 2>curation and turning it into like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>create just creation again.</v>

108
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the fourth trend I noticed was,</v>

109
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of self promotion.</v>

110
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like life as an advertisement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something I think we all feel to</v>

111
00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:24.310
<v Speaker 2>different degrees when we fill out our</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook profiles and when we develop</v>

112
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 2>these online personas for ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this way that we try to</v>

113
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 2>advertise ourselves and look as awesome</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we possibly can.</v>

114
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look how hot my girlfriend is,</v>

115
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:35.740
<v Speaker 2>look how wild my party was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look how fun my vacation was,</v>

116
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:38.440
<v Speaker 2>all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that creates a lot of</v>

117
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.220
<v Speaker 2>unhealthy tendencies in people because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start comparing yourselves to</v>

118
00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:43.054
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

119
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.870
<v Speaker 2>you're always looking for ways to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>cooler than you are leads to insecurity</v>

120
00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:50.260
<v Speaker 2>and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was interested in taking that self</v>

121
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 2>promotion and turning it into more of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>contemplative self reflection.</v>

122
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
