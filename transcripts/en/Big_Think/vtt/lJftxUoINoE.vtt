1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.010
<v Speaker 1>So my name is Dan Arielli and I'm the</v>
<v Speaker 1>James B Duke professor of psychology and</v>

2
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:10.011
<v Speaker 1>behavioral economics at Duke University.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I became interested in online dating</v>

3
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:14.850
<v Speaker 1>because one of the people who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in an office next to me was</v>

4
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:17.700
<v Speaker 1>incredibly miserable and he was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>assistant professor.</v>

5
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>He just moved to the university where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was at a.</v>

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>He was spending long hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was not finding anybody to date.</v>

7
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>He was couldn't date students at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university who was a professor and he</v>

8
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:29.670
<v Speaker 1>didn't have time to go outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>we will not particularly social bunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was basically stuck and all I did it</v>

11
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>was a very promising way to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this solution for a marketplace that</v>

12
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>wasn't working very well and he tried</v>
<v Speaker 1>online dating and he was just failing</v>

13
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>miserably continuously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that kind of piqued my curiosity</v>

14
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:46.824
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

15
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.020
<v Speaker 1>And then I started looking at online</v>
<v Speaker 1>dating.</v>

16
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>So I started looking by registering</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself and looking at other people.</v>

17
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.030
<v Speaker 1>And then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>

18
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 1>let me ask some of my friends to enroll</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't ask them to really</v>

19
00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>enroll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just took the profile sheets and</v>

20
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 1>they ask people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you fill those out but without</v>

21
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.280
<v Speaker 1>your name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they took people that I liked more</v>

22
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>than I liked less and they took a profit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I tried to figure out who they tell</v>

23
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

24
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>and imagine that you did this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you went to 50 people you really</v>

25
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 1>like and 50 people you only like so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

26
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>and you asked all of them to feel this</v>
<v Speaker 1>profit.</v>

27
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.760
<v Speaker 1>Then you took this 100 profiles and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to sort them into piles.</v>

28
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>It turns out we were terrible at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

29
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:27.900
<v Speaker 1>So this is kind of an initial</v>
<v Speaker 1>observation is that something is going</v>

30
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>wrong in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this market,</v>

31
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:33.720
<v Speaker 1>and then went a step further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did some studies with online data is</v>

32
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>about how much they enjoyed it and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were getting from it until the</v>

33
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>final stage we.</v>

34
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 1>I figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I knew what was going on,</v>

35
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.910
<v Speaker 1>which is that online dating site assume</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are easy to describe on</v>

36
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:49.800
<v Speaker 1>searchable attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that we're like digital</v>

37
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>cameras that you can describe somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>by their height and weight and political</v>

38
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>affiliation and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out people are much more</v>

39
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:59.790
<v Speaker 1>like wine that when you taste the wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could describe it,</v>

40
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>but he's not a very useful description,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know if you like it or don't,</v>

41
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.280
<v Speaker 1>is the complexity and the completeness</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the experience that tells you if</v>

42
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:11.960
<v Speaker 1>you're like a person or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these breaking into attributes turns</v>

43
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 1>out not to be very informative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the last stage of this process,</v>

44
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>we created a different website and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>different websites allow people to</v>

45
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>experience other people without all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these attributes and we show that this</v>

46
00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>is actually much better and would lead</v>
<v Speaker 1>to much more,</v>

47
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.170
<v Speaker 1>much higher probability of going on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>second on the real date afterwards.</v>

48
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it kind of goes from an observation</v>

49
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>to a little study to a bit more details</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally proposing some kind of</v>

50
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:39.450
<v Speaker 1>solution of something that I think would</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually work better.</v>

51
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.230
<v Speaker 1>So the site basically looks at real</v>
<v Speaker 1>dates and think about what real dates</v>

52
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not about sitting in a room and</v>

53
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.030
<v Speaker 1>interviewing each other about question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're often about experiencing.</v>

54
00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:54.690
<v Speaker 1>It's in something together in the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and I think it's because if you</v>

55
00:02:54.691 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 1>and I went out and we went somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would look at how you react to the</v>

56
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>outside world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what music you like,</v>

57
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 1>what you don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of pictures you like,</v>

58
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>what kind of images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you react to other people,</v>

59
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>what do you do in the restaurant and</v>
<v Speaker 1>through all these kinds of non explicit</v>

60
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will learn something about,</v>

61
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would feel that I'm learning something</v>

62
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>about you and the online system we</v>
<v Speaker 1>created was very much like that.</v>

63
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>It was about you came up when you got</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little Avatar is square or triangle,</v>

64
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:26.851
<v Speaker 1>some color and you wanting to a virtual</v>
<v Speaker 1>space which you could explore it and you</v>

65
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>could see lots of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were pictures and images and there</v>

66
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:34.050
<v Speaker 1>were words and there were movies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were bands.</v>

67
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 1>There's all kinds of stuff and you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>go and when you came to another little</v>

68
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Avatar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could start chatting and you would</v>

69
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 1>chat about something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't about interviewing when you</v>

70
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>went to school in what's your religion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about talking about something</v>

71
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>else and it turns out it gave people</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more information about each other</v>

72
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>and they're much more likely to want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet each other for the first eight and</v>

73
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:54.210
<v Speaker 1>four for a second date.</v>

74
00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 1>So I think that online dating is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly unsatisfying experience.</v>

75
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we do surveys to understand what</v>

76
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 1>people do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they the basic trade off is for each six</v>

77
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 1>hours of searching for people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>emailing them and you get one cup of</v>

78
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 1>coffee and it's not as if people enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 1>online dating.</v>

79
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not as if they have fun searching</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in a writing blogs for them.</v>

80
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean imagine that you basically had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive six hours,</v>

81
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 1>three hours each week to have coffee</v>
<v Speaker 1>with somebody and you know,</v>

82
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 1>coffee usually ends up with just coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an incredibly unsatisfying</v>

83
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.010
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

84
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really bad system.</v>

85
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.650
<v Speaker 1>On top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another thing is,</v>

86
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:40.450
<v Speaker 1>which I imagine they gave you the search</v>
<v Speaker 1>criteria which asks you to search by</v>

87
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:43.000
<v Speaker 1>height and weight and income and all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

88
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.190
<v Speaker 1>You're going to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I give you to search.</v>

89
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:47.200
<v Speaker 1>You're going to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a million people out there.</v>

90
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.380
<v Speaker 1>You want to limit them to $3,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're going to.</v>

91
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.690
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're going to use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because of that,</v>

92
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:55.940
<v Speaker 1>I think actually people become much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>superficial than we think they're.</v>

93
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that women really care</v>

94
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:02.410
<v Speaker 1>about men's height.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm five nine.</v>

95
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.340
<v Speaker 1>If I wanted to be as attractive as</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's five,</v>

96
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.970
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Another inch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to make about 35,</v>

98
00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>$40,000 more a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another money for one inch.</v>

99
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that men care a lot about</v>

100
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:19.030
<v Speaker 1>women's BMS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

101
00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:21.000
<v Speaker 1>they want women to be slightly on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rack sick.</v>

102
00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like 18 and a half and you look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>women's attractiveness.</v>

103
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:27.520
<v Speaker 1>It goes really up at low BMI and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>drops below that.</v>

104
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Now people online look incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>superficial,</v>

105
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 1>they look at hair color and they look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>height and they look at income and</v>

106
00:05:34.661 --> 00:05:37.480
<v Speaker 1>that's basically it and attractiveness</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

107
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>and you can ask is it because that's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>people care about or is that because</v>

108
00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:45.490
<v Speaker 1>that's what the system is giving them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>search for and I think it's because of</v>

109
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.780
<v Speaker 1>combination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

110
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also prefer,</v>

111
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:51.070
<v Speaker 1>sure we do care about attractiveness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in heightened income,</v>

112
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:52.960
<v Speaker 1>and these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are features for us,</v>

113
00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Speaker 1>but they think they're exaggerated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the system is creative.</v>

114
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you were looking for something</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

115
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you were looking for eh digital</v>
<v Speaker 1>cameras and imagine that I only allow</v>

116
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 1>you to search on mega pixels and the f</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop for the Lens,</v>

117
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things will become incredibly</v>

118
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

119
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>And if I drop some things from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>search,</v>

120
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 1>they will become as if they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>important or much less important.</v>

121
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.030
<v Speaker 1>So I think part of the problem is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the systems don't give us the right</v>

122
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>information that we need and because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

123
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 1>I think the experience of online dating</v>
<v Speaker 1>is generally unsatisfying.</v>

124
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:29.803
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>

125
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 1>how many millions of people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>participating in this activity and a</v>

126
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 1>marriage rates has not increased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Divorce rate has decreased.</v>

127
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really much has happened because of</v>

128
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>the Atlantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time.</v>

129
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.950
<v Speaker 1>I think it's incredibly important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

130
00:06:44.951 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dating market is perhaps the only</v>

131
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:52.980
<v Speaker 1>market that we moved from a centralized</v>
<v Speaker 1>market to a decentralized markets.</v>

132
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to have a into your parents used</v>

133
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 1>to tell you what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this is gone.</v>

134
00:06:57.321 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Now you have to fend for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On top of that,</v>

135
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:00.910
<v Speaker 1>we move a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

136
00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:03.410
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to one place for Undergrad,</v>

137
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.410
<v Speaker 1>then you go to Grad school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you move to another city for a job</v>

138
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 1>to easily remove.</v>

139
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no time to create a social</v>

140
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:11.360
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We work long hours,</v>

141
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.690
<v Speaker 1>so it really assist them where we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have time to find people for ourselves.</v>

142
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.130
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's taboo to date people at the</v>

143
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:20.470
<v Speaker 1>workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

144
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 1>the social networks are weaker in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical world.</v>

145
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.630
<v Speaker 1>We move all the time and we don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

146
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.370
<v Speaker 1>our parents to tell us what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

147
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.670
<v Speaker 1>so online dating are incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

148
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 1>They could be central and crucial and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to create them because it's really</v>

149
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:38.570
<v Speaker 1>a miserable situation for most single</v>
<v Speaker 1>people at the same time.</v>

150
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:40.790
<v Speaker 1>The ones that we have created and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>all look the same.</v>

151
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no real differences between</v>

152
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.300
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that we're creating,</v>

153
00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:45.350
<v Speaker 1>I just not that useful.</v>

154
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Assortative mating is the idea that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you took all men and you rank them on</v>

155
00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:56.590
<v Speaker 1>how attractive they are from the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive to the least attractive and</v>

156
00:07:56.591 --> 00:07:59.960
<v Speaker 1>you write it all women from the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive to the least attractive and</v>

157
00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 1>you can think about attractiveness is</v>
<v Speaker 1>built,</v>

158
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.230
<v Speaker 1>being built from lots of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

159
00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:06.380
<v Speaker 1>It's not just beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be beauty and intelligence and</v>

160
00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:08.750
<v Speaker 1>so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you created this,</v>

161
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.950
<v Speaker 1>it was mostly about beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

162
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.730
<v Speaker 1>if you created that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that the most attractive</v>

163
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.320
<v Speaker 1>would date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most attractive,</v>

164
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 1>the middle attractive with basically the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle and the low data low.</v>

165
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Now there could be slight deviations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what happened and why?</v>

166
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're at the top and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy,</v>

167
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:27.440
<v Speaker 1>you can pick anybody you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you would pick a woman who was on the</v>

168
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 1>top and if she's at the top she could</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick anybody she wants you will pick</v>

169
00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:30.820
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

170
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.960
<v Speaker 1>So another question is what happened to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people in the middle,</v>

171
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:34.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of us,</v>

172
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:36.620
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens to people in the middle,</v>

173
00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 1>how do we make sense of where we are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social hierarchy?</v>

174
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:44.240
<v Speaker 1>And for me that thought actually became</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very kind of crucial in the parents</v>

175
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:46.430
<v Speaker 1>when I got injured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's what happened.</v>

176
00:08:46.431 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you grow up and you have some kind of</v>

177
00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:51.470
<v Speaker 1>space in society and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically where you are and you know,</v>

178
00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:55.760
<v Speaker 1>who date you and who would not take you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's kind of outside of your league in</v>

179
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.610
<v Speaker 1>general terms and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you fit in the social hierarchy.</v>

180
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.000
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

181
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.280
<v Speaker 1>and I knew I wasn't a social hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one day I got badly injured and you</v>

182
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't think about romantic stuff</v>

183
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:09.000
<v Speaker 1>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I could,</v>

184
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>office and I started wondering about</v>

185
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 1>where do I fall now in the social</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

186
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I fall in the same place?</v>

187
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of the same person inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I look much less attractive.</v>

188
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with the women who were dating</v>

189
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 1>before we keep on dating me now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

190
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:27.390
<v Speaker 1>why would they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have other options,</v>

191
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the only guy in the world.</v>

192
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.920
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was kind of a very difficult</v>

193
00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:34.460
<v Speaker 1>concept for me to think about where do I</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall?</v>

194
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I felt differently on the social</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

195
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I basically lost my space all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and I was trying to understand how</v>

196
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:43.530
<v Speaker 1>these social dance happened and how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>find our place.</v>

197
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:46.490
<v Speaker 1>And I was really wondering about where</v>
<v Speaker 1>would I find my own mate,</v>

198
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.990
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where would I fit in this in this scale?</v>

199
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:52.470
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexities with it,</v>

200
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.940
<v Speaker 1>but eventually it led me to a study in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the study was really asking the question</v>

201
00:09:57.941 --> 00:10:02.941
<v Speaker 1>of how do we make sense of where we fit</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the hierarchy and the basically kind</v>

202
00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 1>of multiple explanations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

203
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.910
<v Speaker 1>You could say you never adjust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never.</v>

204
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 1>If you kind of in the middle range or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the low range and you only are.</v>

205
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.960
<v Speaker 1>You have to date somebody else who's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle range.</v>

206
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.250
<v Speaker 1>You never make peace with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wake up every morning,</v>

207
00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.050
<v Speaker 1>you look at your partner across your</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder and you say,</v>

208
00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:23.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the best I could.</v>

209
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.010
<v Speaker 1>I really wanted more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>

210
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.260
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to admit my limitations.</v>

211
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:30.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the most I could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means you don't adapt.</v>

212
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.070
<v Speaker 1>It could be that you adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be that,</v>

213
00:10:34.071 --> 00:10:35.940
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're unattractive,</v>

214
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.570
<v Speaker 1>you start looking at other features that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are unattractive and see them as</v>

215
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:42.350
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember the story from cree love</v>

216
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Speaker 1>when you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this wolf city say grapes over the fence</v>

217
00:10:46.801 --> 00:10:49.530
<v Speaker 1>and he tries to get them and he can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get them and eventually said,</v>

218
00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.180
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was sour anyway,</v>

219
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.740
<v Speaker 1>and he goes to eat something else.</v>

220
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could imagine that if you are</v>

221
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.630
<v Speaker 1>attractive yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start valuing.</v>

222
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.340
<v Speaker 1>If you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start valuing short men who are bald</v>

223
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:03.570
<v Speaker 1>with bad teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

224
00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:05.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are really wonderful features.</v>

225
00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:08.150
<v Speaker 1>I like hairy chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like bullheaded.</v>

226
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.780
<v Speaker 1>You basically change what you like and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually helps you adjust.</v>

227
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Or You can imagine that you start liking</v>
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>

228
00:11:16.381 --> 00:11:19.080
<v Speaker 1>You stop paying attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness and start paying</v>

229
00:11:19.081 --> 00:11:22.230
<v Speaker 1>attention to other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we tried that in an experiment.</v>

230
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Initially we went to this website called</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot or not.</v>

231
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a wonderful website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see pictures of people and you</v>

232
00:11:28.501 --> 00:11:32.670
<v Speaker 1>decide you rank them on a scale from</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero to 10 about how attractive they are</v>

233
00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:34.860
<v Speaker 1>and then you see how you rated this</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

234
00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:38.430
<v Speaker 1>how other people rate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the nice feature about this website</v>

235
00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:43.431
<v Speaker 1>is that if I reach people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the website knows how I was rated as</v>

236
00:11:43.591 --> 00:11:45.690
<v Speaker 1>well because I have my picture there as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

237
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:46.980
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not rated very high,</v>

238
00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:51.210
<v Speaker 1>I think like six point four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are people who are rating,</v>

239
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.030
<v Speaker 1>you know how the rating and you know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rated.</v>

240
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.780
<v Speaker 1>So now the question is the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are providing the rating,</v>

241
00:11:57.781 --> 00:11:59.500
<v Speaker 1>there are people who are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive,</v>

242
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:01.960
<v Speaker 1>that are providing writing and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are really unattractive,</v>

243
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.870
<v Speaker 1>providing the rating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing you can ask is do</v>

244
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:08.320
<v Speaker 1>they have different ratings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are the people who are inherently</v>

245
00:12:08.321 --> 00:12:11.500
<v Speaker 1>unattractive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they see beauty differently?</v>

246
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.160
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all see beauty in the same way.</v>

247
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:20.140
<v Speaker 1>The people who are nine rate people the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way as the people who are for in</v>

248
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 1>the hotness rating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

249
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.490
<v Speaker 1>so people don't change their sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty.</v>

250
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

251
00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.650
<v Speaker 1>so maybe they don't adjust at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't adapt the people who</v>

252
00:12:29.651 --> 00:12:34.651
<v Speaker 1>are for coupons looking for the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are with nine or maybe they adapt</v>

253
00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:35.584
<v Speaker 1>some other way.</v>

254
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 1>So hot the note has another feature</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the cycle of meet me in which</v>

255
00:12:40.451 --> 00:12:43.240
<v Speaker 1>you see pictures of people and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I want to meet them or not?</v>

256
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not just reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about also thinking about the</v>

257
00:12:46.511 --> 00:12:51.511
<v Speaker 1>probability that you will be accepted or</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn down and it's not so embarrassing</v>

258
00:12:52.991 --> 00:12:54.760
<v Speaker 1>to be turned online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still a little bit</v>

259
00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:56.890
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is that people who are</v>

260
00:12:56.891 --> 00:12:58.990
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will they approach different people than</v>

261
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:01.870
<v Speaker 1>the people who are for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is absolutely yes.</v>

262
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.050
<v Speaker 1>The people who are for basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>approached people who are four or five,</v>

263
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:08.080
<v Speaker 1>the people who are nine approach people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are nine or 10 people are a little</v>

264
00:13:08.081 --> 00:13:10.090
<v Speaker 1>optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They approach a little too high,</v>

265
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.170
<v Speaker 1>but they basically know the rage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened is people know the</v>

266
00:13:14.171 --> 00:13:15.820
<v Speaker 1>range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know where they are in the social</v>

267
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:19.330
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the same time they see beauty at the</v>

268
00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:19.840
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

269
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.600
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how people solve it,</v>

270
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.540
<v Speaker 1>they wake up every morning feeling bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do they solve it in some way?</v>

271
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.950
<v Speaker 1>So the last step we did the speed dating</v>
<v Speaker 1>events.</v>

272
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.120
<v Speaker 1>We get people to do a speed dating event</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we asked them to rate other people</v>

273
00:13:32.121 --> 00:13:34.630
<v Speaker 1>or lots of attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just attractiveness,</v>

274
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:38.290
<v Speaker 1>but all kinds of other things and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw was the people who are very</v>

275
00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:42.340
<v Speaker 1>attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cared more about attractiveness.</v>

276
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.680
<v Speaker 1>This is like one of the dominating</v>
<v Speaker 1>criteria.</v>

277
00:13:44.681 --> 00:13:46.570
<v Speaker 1>They want to date somebody who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>

278
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.710
<v Speaker 1>While the people who are unattractive</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically say we don't care so much</v>

279
00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:53.860
<v Speaker 1>about attractiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want people who are kind and have a</v>

280
00:13:53.861 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 1>good sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened is that the way people</v>

281
00:13:57.101 --> 00:14:02.101
<v Speaker 1>adapt the people at the low end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale is by changing your priorities and</v>

282
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:06.880
<v Speaker 1>office and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want people with different set of</v>

283
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.140
<v Speaker 1>attributes I don't care so much about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want somebody who's client good</v>

284
00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:14.380
<v Speaker 1>hearted with a good sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually the story for the</v>

285
00:14:14.381 --> 00:14:17.200
<v Speaker 1>patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the story of how we are coming</v>

286
00:14:17.201 --> 00:14:21.760
<v Speaker 1>into a social hierarchy in a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>place and based on our circumstances</v>

287
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.750
<v Speaker 1>come to understand differently what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>want and don't want and how we view the</v>

288
00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:29.470
<v Speaker 1>world in a way that is compatible with</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we are in the social hierarchy.</v>

289
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.740
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if you've had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of going into a Kia,</v>

290
00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:35.650
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

291
00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I go from time to time and the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing I did was a builder,</v>

292
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.810
<v Speaker 1>a toy chest for my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for my kids.</v>

293
00:14:40.811 --> 00:14:45.811
<v Speaker 1>And when I got home with this box</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually set up boxes and they started</v>

294
00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:47.170
<v Speaker 1>assembling them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

295
00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.660
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the instructions were very unclear and I</v>

296
00:14:49.661 --> 00:14:52.880
<v Speaker 1>kept on screwing things and screwing</v>
<v Speaker 1>them wrongly and had to disassemble it,</v>

297
00:14:52.881 --> 00:14:54.260
<v Speaker 1>put it back together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so on.</v>

298
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.140
<v Speaker 1>By the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked a lot.</v>

299
00:14:57.141 --> 00:14:59.360
<v Speaker 1>It was not a particularly beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of furniture,</v>

300
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.250
<v Speaker 1>but I was actually quite attached to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did.</v>

301
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.600
<v Speaker 1>I think that's kind of the interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea is that when you put a lot of</v>

302
00:15:05.601 --> 00:15:08.860
<v Speaker 1>yourself into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sweat and energy and anger,</v>

303
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.730
<v Speaker 1>not even frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up loving the end product a bit</v>

304
00:15:13.731 --> 00:15:14.564
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

305
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:20.050
<v Speaker 1>We tried to do this with experiments and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got people to build the Legos in and</v>

306
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.480
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of things and the first thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found was that if there was an</v>

307
00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:26.210
<v Speaker 1>origami that you build in Origami that</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else built,</v>

308
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.490
<v Speaker 1>you think that yours is much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more beautiful.</v>

309
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Not only is it more beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you willing to pay much more for it.</v>

310
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is why you could imagine I</v>

311
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:39.110
<v Speaker 1>built an origami that is uniquely good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me and you the other origami is not</v>

312
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:42.950
<v Speaker 1>so it's unique to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about the fact that I kind of</v>

313
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.500
<v Speaker 1>wrongly evaluated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just has some features that are</v>

314
00:15:45.501 --> 00:15:49.280
<v Speaker 1>particularly like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we ask people to predict how other</v>

315
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:52.430
<v Speaker 1>people would pay for it and it turns out</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are really wrong with it.</v>

316
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Not only do we like more the origami we</v>
<v Speaker 1>make,</v>

317
00:15:55.071 --> 00:15:57.470
<v Speaker 1>we think other people would love them as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

318
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.940
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about kids like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

319
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.530
<v Speaker 1>I have two wonderful kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love them dearly.</v>

320
00:16:03.531 --> 00:16:07.400
<v Speaker 1>I think they're amazing when we go to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>party and they dance or do something.</v>

321
00:16:07.401 --> 00:16:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that any of the parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>would want to do anything but look at my</v>

322
00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:12.500
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

323
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's the issue right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My kids,</v>

324
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:17.000
<v Speaker 1>I think they're are wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

325
00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:20.890
<v Speaker 1>I think that other people should see</v>
<v Speaker 1>them as wonderful as I see them in the</v>

326
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.150
<v Speaker 1>same thing happened with origami or with</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything we make.</v>

327
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Not only do we overvalue it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think that everybody will share our,</v>

328
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.500
<v Speaker 1>our perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

329
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.560
<v Speaker 1>this of course creates both</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities for better things and</v>

330
00:16:36.561 --> 00:16:38.630
<v Speaker 1>opportunities for mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

331
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.000
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a company and you can create</v>

332
00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:44.150
<v Speaker 1>things that people would actually put</v>
<v Speaker 1>something of themselves into it and</v>

333
00:16:44.151 --> 00:16:46.940
<v Speaker 1>actually value it more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great thing to do,</v>

334
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:47.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

335
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of opportunities for</v>

336
00:16:49.461 --> 00:16:54.020
<v Speaker 1>tailoring and custom made and use a</v>
<v Speaker 1>design on the web.</v>

337
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:59.030
<v Speaker 1>It's also about cooking for yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing your own garden and fixing things</v>

338
00:16:59.031 --> 00:17:02.570
<v Speaker 1>yourself because we might not understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if we do something ourselves,</v>

339
00:17:02.571 --> 00:17:06.680
<v Speaker 1>we would like it more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact is we we likely would do</v>

340
00:17:06.681 --> 00:17:09.760
<v Speaker 1>the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course there's the downside and</v>

341
00:17:09.761 --> 00:17:12.350
<v Speaker 1>the downside is if we create something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ended up loving it,</v>

342
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.290
<v Speaker 1>perhaps too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't sit it in an objective way and</v>

343
00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:17.690
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence we can make mistakes as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

344
00:17:17.691 --> 00:17:21.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually a general comment</v>
<v Speaker 1>about rationality and irrationality.</v>

345
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Rationality and irrationality is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>always bad.</v>

346
00:17:24.561 --> 00:17:27.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not always that the irrational</v>
<v Speaker 1>person is better than irrational.</v>

347
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a mixture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

348
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.560
<v Speaker 1>It's really wonderful that we can love</v>
<v Speaker 1>our kids so much that that's why they</v>

349
00:17:33.561 --> 00:17:36.470
<v Speaker 1>actually get to live and we care about</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

350
00:17:36.471 --> 00:17:38.840
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our blindness to them,</v>

351
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.950
<v Speaker 1>to them or to the weaknesses can</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually create some negative</v>

352
00:17:42.951 --> 00:17:44.000
<v Speaker 1>consequences as well.</v>

353
00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 1>So I think the world would actually be</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite terrible if everybody would be,</v>

354
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.080
<v Speaker 1>would be perfectly rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

355
00:17:52.081 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 1>when you ask people this question</v>
<v Speaker 1>initially,</v>

356
00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:53.941
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

357
00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:57.330
<v Speaker 1>I want everybody to be irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact is that I pick the title,</v>

358
00:17:57.331 --> 00:17:59.760
<v Speaker 1>the upside of irrationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think there's a lot of</v>

359
00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:02.790
<v Speaker 1>wonderful things about your rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you two examples.</v>

360
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:08.280
<v Speaker 1>The first one is imagine that you left</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wallet on your desk and you went</v>

361
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:11.640
<v Speaker 1>out for lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the odds that somebody will</v>

362
00:18:11.641 --> 00:18:14.910
<v Speaker 1>steal it right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now think about what are the odds</v>

363
00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:17.460
<v Speaker 1>that somebody would steal it if</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody you worked with was perfectly</v>

364
00:18:17.461 --> 00:18:19.980
<v Speaker 1>rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If everybody was constantly doing the</v>

365
00:18:19.981 --> 00:18:23.280
<v Speaker 1>cost benefit analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's all what people were doing,</v>

366
00:18:23.281 --> 00:18:24.840
<v Speaker 1>they would pass by your desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would say,</v>

367
00:18:24.841 --> 00:18:25.680
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's here.</v>

368
00:18:25.681 --> 00:18:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can steal this and have no chance of</v>

369
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:29.730
<v Speaker 1>being caught.</v>

370
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Let me do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

371
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.960
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we lived in a society where everybody</v>

372
00:18:33.961 --> 00:18:37.200
<v Speaker 1>was just maximizing their own self</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest all the time,</v>

373
00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:39.360
<v Speaker 1>it will be quite a terrible place to</v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

374
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Here's another example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine a game we call the trust game</v>

375
00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:45.030
<v Speaker 1>and then I'll tell you about the trust</v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

376
00:18:45.031 --> 00:18:46.980
<v Speaker 1>We'd revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine two players,</v>

377
00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:50.040
<v Speaker 1>player a and player B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the trust game looks like this.</v>

378
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.560
<v Speaker 1>We tell player a player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have $20,</v>

379
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.100
<v Speaker 1>you could do two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can either go home or you can give</v>

380
00:18:56.101 --> 00:18:59.220
<v Speaker 1>your money to player b and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know who play B is and you'll ever meet</v>

381
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:01.470
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you send your money to play or a B</v>

382
00:19:01.471 --> 00:19:04.550
<v Speaker 1>player b will get $80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money will quadruple magically</v>

383
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.230
<v Speaker 1>underway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now play a beat who decide to do two</v>

384
00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:09.060
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could go home with $80,</v>

385
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:12.360
<v Speaker 1>in which case you will get nothing or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could send you back half the money.</v>

386
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Now think about this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you player a and you ask</v>

387
00:19:16.201 --> 00:19:20.460
<v Speaker 1>yourself what would play or be do if</v>
<v Speaker 1>player b was perfectly rational,</v>

388
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.250
<v Speaker 1>what would they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will go home with all the money,</v>

389
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will maximize the self interest.</v>

390
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Why would they give you back any money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you thought that player b was</v>

391
00:19:29.341 --> 00:19:31.290
<v Speaker 1>perfectly rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you send them the money?</v>

392
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Of course not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

393
00:19:33.061 --> 00:19:36.750
<v Speaker 1>So the rational prediction is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>player b will never send the money back,</v>

394
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.420
<v Speaker 1>and because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>player a will never trust him to start</v>

395
00:19:39.421 --> 00:19:41.640
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turns out people are much nicer than</v>

396
00:19:41.641 --> 00:19:44.290
<v Speaker 1>economic theory predicts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a good chance that player a,</v>

397
00:19:44.291 --> 00:19:45.920
<v Speaker 1>we'll send them money and a good chess</v>
<v Speaker 1>player.</v>

398
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.880
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll send half the money back.</v>

399
00:19:47.881 --> 00:19:50.430
<v Speaker 1>And if you were a player b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just imagine.</v>

400
00:19:50.431 --> 00:19:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you just got in the mail.</v>

401
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Somebody that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

402
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.950
<v Speaker 1>here's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you send the money back or not?</v>

403
00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people would do it.</v>

404
00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.790
<v Speaker 1>So people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the case when people are</v>

405
00:19:59.791 --> 00:20:04.020
<v Speaker 1>national economic theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but imagine your player a and you send</v>

406
00:20:04.021 --> 00:20:08.180
<v Speaker 1>them money to player B and player b took</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money and left and now I come to you</v>

407
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.821
<v Speaker 1>and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

408
00:20:08.821 --> 00:20:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Salary player a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lost all your money.</v>

409
00:20:11.281 --> 00:20:14.910
<v Speaker 1>But I tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go into a checking account and</v>

410
00:20:14.911 --> 00:20:19.911
<v Speaker 1>you get more money out and you give it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me for every dollar you give me,</v>

411
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I will go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will hunt,</v>

412
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.270
<v Speaker 1>play a beat down and I'll take $2 away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from them.</v>

413
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.720
<v Speaker 1>You give me $2,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 109,</v>

414
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.460
<v Speaker 1>take four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gave me 10 $100 and take from them</v>

415
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:35.140
<v Speaker 1>and the question is would you lose more</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your own money to exert revenge on</v>

416
00:20:35.551 --> 00:20:36.384
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

417
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:40.770
<v Speaker 1>You just lost $20 and you can lose even</v>
<v Speaker 1>more to exact revenge on them.</v>

418
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.670
<v Speaker 1>And everybody who had a divorce or</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakup know the answer right?</v>

419
00:20:44.671 --> 00:20:48.490
<v Speaker 1>When we feel betrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would spend lots and lots of money to</v>

420
00:20:48.491 --> 00:20:51.400
<v Speaker 1>inflict even more pain on the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

421
00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.540
<v Speaker 1>And when Ernst Fair in some of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends did it work like this,</v>

422
00:20:55.541 --> 00:20:59.530
<v Speaker 1>they basically put people in an imaging</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they could image people's brains</v>

423
00:20:59.531 --> 00:21:03.540
<v Speaker 1>while they were executing and plotting</v>
<v Speaker 1>revenge and what they saw was that the</v>

424
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.780
<v Speaker 1>activity of revenge was rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pleasurable.</v>

425
00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's irrational.</v>

426
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be rewarding and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasurable?</v>

427
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that you and I were living on a</v>

428
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:21.100
<v Speaker 1>desert island and imagined I had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mango and you wanted my mango and</v>

429
00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:23.950
<v Speaker 1>imagine I kind of looked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was away for a minute and you could</v>

430
00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:28.360
<v Speaker 1>still my mango if you thought that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only thing I was doing is a cost benefit</v>

431
00:21:28.361 --> 00:21:29.050
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

432
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:29.883
<v Speaker 1>You would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

433
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.590
<v Speaker 1>if I steal Dan's mango and run far away</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

434
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.070
<v Speaker 1>he will do the cost benefit analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will decide not to chase me,</v>

435
00:21:36.071 --> 00:21:39.340
<v Speaker 1>not to find out what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll just go and get the new mango and</v>

436
00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:42.070
<v Speaker 1>under those circumstances a good chance</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll take my mango away,</v>

437
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:47.320
<v Speaker 1>but what if I was a revengeful type?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you knew that if you stole my</v>

438
00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:49.750
<v Speaker 1>mango,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will not sleep and I will not rest.</v>

439
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I will hunt you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter how long it will take</v>

440
00:21:53.561 --> 00:21:57.370
<v Speaker 1>me and how far I have to run and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many nights I will not sleep.</v>

441
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.550
<v Speaker 1>I will hunt you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take my mango and all your bananas</v>

442
00:22:00.551 --> 00:22:04.210
<v Speaker 1>in your goat and your whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is under that condition,</v>

443
00:22:04.211 --> 00:22:05.980
<v Speaker 1>you will probably not start with me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>start with.</v>

444
00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will not take anything with me.</v>

445
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.400
<v Speaker 1>So the way to understand it is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>trusting is irrational,</v>

446
00:22:12.401 --> 00:22:15.760
<v Speaker 1>but we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Revenge is irrational,</v>

447
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.990
<v Speaker 1>but we do it and we do it because trust</v>
<v Speaker 1>and revenge are actually two sides of</v>

448
00:22:19.991 --> 00:22:23.590
<v Speaker 1>the same coin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust is incredibly important for</v>

449
00:22:23.591 --> 00:22:26.740
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how we would live in a society</v>

450
00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:28.990
<v Speaker 1>without trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to have trust,</v>

451
00:22:28.991 --> 00:22:33.070
<v Speaker 1>we also have to have revenge and those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things together make sense.</v>

452
00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:36.520
<v Speaker 1>They're both irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're both make sense and they</v>

453
00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:39.370
<v Speaker 1>actually help us to live in a better</v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

454
00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.690
<v Speaker 1>So would I prefer a society when</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's rational?</v>

455
00:22:43.691 --> 00:22:45.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not In a.</v>

456
00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.293
<v Speaker 1>not in a long shot.</v>

457
00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:53.590
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I think companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>do to a large degree that makes very</v>

458
00:22:53.591 --> 00:22:58.591
<v Speaker 1>little sense is the use of focus groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think about what a strange idea is</v>

459
00:22:58.751 --> 00:23:03.751
<v Speaker 1>that we take 10 people who know</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically nothing about your project and</v>

460
00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.030
<v Speaker 1>you put them in a room and you let them</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk for awhile and then you take the</v>

461
00:23:07.031 --> 00:23:10.630
<v Speaker 1>whatever they came up with as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of these two hours of random</v>

462
00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.650
<v Speaker 1>thinking and you base your strategy on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to a large degree.</v>

463
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.480
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to say that focus</v>

464
00:23:16.481 --> 00:23:19.030
<v Speaker 1>groups are always useless and also</v>
<v Speaker 1>uninformative,</v>

465
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.350
<v Speaker 1>but I think that taking this data and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then realizing it as extensively as</v>

466
00:23:23.351 --> 00:23:25.310
<v Speaker 1>companies do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

467
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:29.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it's crazy in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I think companies do it</v>

468
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:33.310
<v Speaker 1>is because when these people create a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence or an idea,</v>

469
00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:38.311
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joe focus group 17 said this and it can</v>

470
00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.520
<v Speaker 1>help you create a form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate an idea around it.</v>

471
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.120
<v Speaker 1>When if you said 87 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people said x,</v>

472
00:23:47.121 --> 00:23:49.700
<v Speaker 1>he just doesn't have a face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have a desire,</v>

473
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:53.960
<v Speaker 1>it's just not as concrete and therefore</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are not as excited about the,</v>

474
00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.200
<v Speaker 1>about the notion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the focus group is incredibly</v>

475
00:23:57.201 --> 00:24:00.390
<v Speaker 1>useful as a persuasive attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

476
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.850
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell people what to do,</v>

477
00:24:01.851 --> 00:24:06.740
<v Speaker 1>but as a way to find out information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as useful as people think it</v>

478
00:24:06.741 --> 00:24:09.740
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that really puzzles me</v>

479
00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 1>is that the companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how little they understand about how</v>

480
00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:16.740
<v Speaker 1>incentives really work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

481
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:20.120
<v Speaker 1>the biggest expenditure for almost any</v>
<v Speaker 1>company is salaries.</v>

482
00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.970
<v Speaker 1>And you ask people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you know about the relationship</v>

483
00:24:22.971 --> 00:24:26.180
<v Speaker 1>between salaries and performance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is nothing.</v>

484
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question is why don't they study</v>

485
00:24:29.331 --> 00:24:31.050
<v Speaker 1>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they studied?</v>

486
00:24:31.051 --> 00:24:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they try different</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>

487
00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:36.470
<v Speaker 1>different incentive level and see how it</v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced a performance.</v>

488
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:41.470
<v Speaker 1>And they often say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the law kind of laws and if we have</v>

489
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.510
<v Speaker 1>pay some people one way and another way</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might be sued.</v>

490
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.820
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the last two years with all these</v>

491
00:24:46.821 --> 00:24:49.850
<v Speaker 1>questions about bonuses and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gone to many companies and said,</v>

492
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:54.350
<v Speaker 1>why don't we at least do some surveys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we at least see how happy</v>

493
00:24:54.351 --> 00:24:56.900
<v Speaker 1>people are on the months where they give</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

494
00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.120
<v Speaker 1>you give them their bonus and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive they are.</v>

495
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.290
<v Speaker 1>And the answer I got 100 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time is that people are really miserable</v>

496
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.720
<v Speaker 1>in both the season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of that they don't want to</v>

497
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.180
<v Speaker 1>ask them any more questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

498
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:11.510
<v Speaker 1>if people are miserable in bonuses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't it mean that you should study</v>

499
00:25:11.511 --> 00:25:13.730
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it and try to prevent it from</v>

500
00:25:13.731 --> 00:25:15.200
<v Speaker 1>next for next year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And say,</v>

501
00:25:15.201 --> 00:25:16.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well not this year,</v>

502
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:17.960
<v Speaker 1>this year was really miserable.</v>

503
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe next year come back to us next</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

504
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.610
<v Speaker 1>But if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really incredible.</v>

505
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Now how do companies decide about</v>
<v Speaker 1>compensation?</v>

506
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:29.840
<v Speaker 1>They look at what other companies are</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and try to equate compensation to</v>

507
00:25:29.841 --> 00:25:33.080
<v Speaker 1>what other companies are doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a place of the blind leading</v>

508
00:25:33.081 --> 00:25:34.010
<v Speaker 1>the blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

509
00:25:34.011 --> 00:25:36.560
<v Speaker 1>And then if we pay five percent more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people will start doing it,</v>

510
00:25:36.561 --> 00:25:38.900
<v Speaker 1>but the real question is how do you pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>in?</v>

511
00:25:38.901 --> 00:25:42.680
<v Speaker 1>How do you get people to care about</v>
<v Speaker 1>their work and become more productive</v>

512
00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:47.720
<v Speaker 1>and be happier at their work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is not simply that more</v>

513
00:25:47.721 --> 00:25:50.660
<v Speaker 1>money is better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more money can be part of the equation,</v>

514
00:25:50.661 --> 00:25:52.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the question of how do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>give that money?</v>

515
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.940
<v Speaker 1>You give it a bonus to give this a fixed</v>
<v Speaker 1>salary.</v>

516
00:25:55.990 --> 00:26:00.770
<v Speaker 1>You give it as a part of the benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you give benefits for the gym.</v>

517
00:26:00.771 --> 00:26:02.840
<v Speaker 1>Do you send people on vacation to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bahamas?</v>

518
00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.880
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that there are ways to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use money that is economically less</v>

519
00:26:07.881 --> 00:26:10.400
<v Speaker 1>efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually get people to be more</v>

520
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:11.720
<v Speaker 1>motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>care more,</v>

521
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:13.160
<v Speaker 1>and actually become more productive.</v>

522
00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:19.730
<v Speaker 1>So this is a you can think of is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baby Jessica Fair trade.</v>

523
00:26:19.731 --> 00:26:23.080
<v Speaker 1>When Baby Jessica fell to the well and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she really suffered and her parents must</v>

524
00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:27.470
<v Speaker 1>have been incredibly miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got more CNN and coverage in Rwanda</v>

525
00:26:27.471 --> 00:26:32.120
<v Speaker 1>and for right then the question is why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does this happen and why do people</v>

526
00:26:32.121 --> 00:26:34.700
<v Speaker 1>care so much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out there's the research on</v>

527
00:26:34.701 --> 00:26:38.870
<v Speaker 1>what's called the identifiable victim</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect and the question is if you have,</v>

528
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:44.280
<v Speaker 1>how many lives are at stake and how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we care you would that as more live?</v>

529
00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:46.740
<v Speaker 1>So at stake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would care more maybe in the linear</v>

530
00:26:46.741 --> 00:26:49.890
<v Speaker 1>relationship or maybe we will care more</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning and they'll be kind of</v>

531
00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:52.380
<v Speaker 1>a diminishing return.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we wouldn't care if it's 100 or a</v>

532
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.210
<v Speaker 1>thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we care a lot of the bottom range.</v>

533
00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.040
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out the function is</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

534
00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:00.540
<v Speaker 1>We care a lot about individual life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you care less and less as the pie is the</v>

535
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.220
<v Speaker 1>number of people become bigger and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes to kind of an observation is both</v>

536
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:10.390
<v Speaker 1>stallion and Mother Teresa said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stalin said one death is a tragedy,</v>

537
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.880
<v Speaker 1>a million deaths is a statistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mother Theresa said in the same</v>

538
00:27:14.881 --> 00:27:16.980
<v Speaker 1>spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I look at the masters,</v>

539
00:27:16.981 --> 00:27:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I will never act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I look at the one I will and both of</v>

540
00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:25.611
<v Speaker 1>them basically portray this idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened when we kind of think</v>

541
00:27:25.981 --> 00:27:30.150
<v Speaker 1>about recruiting ourselves to act</v>
<v Speaker 1>against something,</v>

542
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:34.600
<v Speaker 1>it's not about our mind thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something about to call calculated,</v>

543
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.590
<v Speaker 1>thought about what's worthwhile and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the cost benefit analysis.</v>

544
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.970
<v Speaker 1>It's about our heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about our emotions and the question</v>

545
00:27:41.971 --> 00:27:46.290
<v Speaker 1>is what can activate emotion and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns out that an individual case can</v>

546
00:27:46.291 --> 00:27:51.291
<v Speaker 1>get us to care versus a big set of cases</v>
<v Speaker 1>just becomes statistics.</v>

547
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:57.150
<v Speaker 1>So this beautiful results by a depth</v>
<v Speaker 1>small and George Loewenstein and Paul</v>

548
00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Slovic that basically say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one girl in Africa who's hungry.</v>

549
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.590
<v Speaker 1>How much money would you give her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then two other people,</v>

550
00:28:04.591 --> 00:28:06.600
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem of hunger in Africa,</v>

551
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:10.740
<v Speaker 1>they have 3 million kids in Sudan and</v>
<v Speaker 1>are 5 million kids here and this.</v>

552
00:28:10.741 --> 00:28:14.910
<v Speaker 1>How much money would you give?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people give half as much to Africa.</v>

553
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Then they give to the single girl Rokia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually gets worse because you said</v>

554
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.260
<v Speaker 1>if people give more when it's emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then when you statistical,</v>

555
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.230
<v Speaker 1>what happens when we give both</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation will say,</v>

556
00:28:28.231 --> 00:28:29.830
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one girl Rokia.</v>

557
00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see how sad she is and how much money</v>

558
00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:33.630
<v Speaker 1>could help her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

559
00:28:33.631 --> 00:28:36.180
<v Speaker 1>there's 5 million more like her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will happen?</v>

560
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.300
<v Speaker 1>It goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that every time you</v>

561
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.600
<v Speaker 1>activate cognition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calculation,</v>

562
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:45.660
<v Speaker 1>thoughtfulness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you turn off the emotion.</v>

563
00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:50.070
<v Speaker 1>People care less and give much less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course this explains a little</v>

564
00:28:50.071 --> 00:28:50.970
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

565
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of imbalance between what we</v>

566
00:28:53.641 --> 00:28:57.540
<v Speaker 1>give to and what we don't give to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think about how difficult it is to</v>

567
00:28:57.541 --> 00:29:02.541
<v Speaker 1>get money for prevention of diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevention of malaria or prevention of</v>

568
00:29:03.361 --> 00:29:07.320
<v Speaker 1>diarrhea or deworming kids in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

569
00:29:07.321 --> 00:29:10.920
<v Speaker 1>lots of kids have have worms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that those things are</v>

570
00:29:10.921 --> 00:29:13.320
<v Speaker 1>incredibly important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly useful.</v>

571
00:29:13.321 --> 00:29:15.570
<v Speaker 1>You can actually get people to be much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much healthier,</v>

572
00:29:15.571 --> 00:29:17.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's not motivating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

573
00:29:17.371 --> 00:29:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Deworming of kids or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a million kids in India just doesn't</v>

574
00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:25.290
<v Speaker 1>make you feel warm and fuzzy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>preventing kids in the future from</v>

575
00:29:25.291 --> 00:29:27.990
<v Speaker 1>getting malaria is again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that exciting.</v>

576
00:29:27.991 --> 00:29:32.991
<v Speaker 1>But if you can help one person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific concrete get something,</v>

577
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:37.740
<v Speaker 1>we all get very excited from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is a real imbalance between</v>

578
00:29:37.741 --> 00:29:41.890
<v Speaker 1>what really matters and what we care</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and what we give time and money</v>

579
00:29:41.891 --> 00:29:42.724
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

580
00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:48.940
<v Speaker 1>If you run the not for profit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you want to build on this on</v>

581
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:52.090
<v Speaker 1>the Russian art is because you care</v>
<v Speaker 1>about your non for profit.</v>

582
00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:55.450
<v Speaker 1>And I think the example here is of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course the American cancer society.</v>

583
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:57.700
<v Speaker 1>They've done a really good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

584
00:29:57.701 --> 00:29:59.600
<v Speaker 1>the word cancer is great in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

585
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.270
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a minute,</v>

586
00:30:01.271 --> 00:30:02.380
<v Speaker 1>recruiting where right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an,</v>

587
00:30:02.381 --> 00:30:07.060
<v Speaker 1>it's an awful disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is the word survivor is</v>

588
00:30:07.061 --> 00:30:09.580
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the third thing they do is they</v>

589
00:30:09.581 --> 00:30:11.800
<v Speaker 1>create an incredible fear from cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

590
00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:14.800
<v Speaker 1>the truth is we all have lots of cancer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we all usually get,</v>

591
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.150
<v Speaker 1>get over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

592
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.240
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people of course it dawned,</v>

593
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.340
<v Speaker 1>but in our lifetime we'll all have</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancerous cells and in most cases it</v>

594
00:30:21.341 --> 00:30:24.180
<v Speaker 1>will be just part of the deal of living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

595
00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.250
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they created these really negative</v>

596
00:30:27.251 --> 00:30:29.380
<v Speaker 1>association that now everybody who had</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>

597
00:30:29.381 --> 00:30:32.620
<v Speaker 1>even if it was not malignant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will not cause them to die or it</v>

598
00:30:32.621 --> 00:30:35.230
<v Speaker 1>was so slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will take 50 years to develop and</v>

599
00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.030
<v Speaker 1>they're called everybody at cancer</v>
<v Speaker 1>survival.</v>

600
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.450
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody who knows them and everybody</v>

601
00:30:40.451 --> 00:30:43.330
<v Speaker 1>who cares about them start caring about</v>
<v Speaker 1>about cancer.</v>

602
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

603
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:45.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of interesting because they</v>

604
00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.370
<v Speaker 1>basically have mastered this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

605
00:30:48.371 --> 00:30:51.490
<v Speaker 1>They've mastered making it central</v>
<v Speaker 1>focal,</v>

606
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:56.280
<v Speaker 1>created very strong fear about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about cancer and,</v>

607
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:59.380
<v Speaker 1>and caring embodied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they basically get a lot of money</v>

608
00:30:59.381 --> 00:31:01.240
<v Speaker 1>and if you look at them as a non for</v>
<v Speaker 1>profit,</v>

609
00:31:01.241 --> 00:31:04.300
<v Speaker 1>they are an incredibly wealthy non for</v>
<v Speaker 1>profit.</v>

610
00:31:04.301 --> 00:31:06.060
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are other non for profit field</v>

611
00:31:06.061 --> 00:31:08.530
<v Speaker 1>that they're Kansas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is getting so much money that people</v>

612
00:31:08.531 --> 00:31:12.370
<v Speaker 1>just don't give to other causes because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give so much to that cause and now</v>

613
00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:16.840
<v Speaker 1>there's all kinds of movements to</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically stop the status as a nonprofit</v>

614
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.780
<v Speaker 1>because they're so wealthy and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>spend so much money on salaries and,</v>

615
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:21.280
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

616
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.310
<v Speaker 1>but in a sense of understanding human</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

617
00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are the top.</v>

618
00:31:26.111 --> 00:31:26.944
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

619
00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:31.660
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of lots of behavior like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

620
00:31:31.661 --> 00:31:32.111
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

621
00:31:32.111 --> 00:31:33.340
<v Speaker 1>the basic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

622
00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:37.840
<v Speaker 1>essence is a trade off between the short</v>
<v Speaker 1>term and long term.</v>

623
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Kind of a personal story about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

624
00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:43.540
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was in hospital a long time ago,</v>

625
00:31:43.541 --> 00:31:48.541
<v Speaker 1>I got to liver disease from bad lunches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fusion and for a long time they didn't</v>

626
00:31:48.791 --> 00:31:50.740
<v Speaker 1>know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from time to time I would get some</v>

627
00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:53.470
<v Speaker 1>liver</v>
<v Speaker 1>infection.</v>

628
00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:56.440
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of bad in about seven years</v>

629
00:31:56.441 --> 00:31:59.620
<v Speaker 1>after I got to India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was already out in the hospital.</v>

630
00:31:59.621 --> 00:32:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I was in Grad school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had another flare up.</v>

631
00:32:01.751 --> 00:32:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I checked myself into a hospital and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found out it was hepatitis C and</v>

632
00:32:06.161 --> 00:32:07.780
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an experimental treatment at</v>

633
00:32:07.781 --> 00:32:10.300
<v Speaker 1>that time called Interferon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why don't you try,</v>

634
00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.420
<v Speaker 1>why don't you try this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very happy to try it because you</v>

635
00:32:13.421 --> 00:32:18.400
<v Speaker 1>know who would want to die from liver</v>
<v Speaker 1>cirrhosis and they basically got these</v>

636
00:32:18.401 --> 00:32:18.970
<v Speaker 1>injections.</v>

637
00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:23.970
<v Speaker 1>I had to inject myself three times a</v>
<v Speaker 1>week for a year and a half and these</v>

638
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:28.090
<v Speaker 1>injections basically symbolize for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of the essence of the human</v>

639
00:32:28.091 --> 00:32:31.090
<v Speaker 1>condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was an injection that could</v>

640
00:32:31.091 --> 00:32:33.640
<v Speaker 1>potentially be very useful for me 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>years later,</v>

641
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.810
<v Speaker 1>but what happened is that he also had</v>
<v Speaker 1>very bad side effects,</v>

642
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.970
<v Speaker 1>so every time I would take an that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be sick for about 16 hours.</v>

643
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Vomiting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaking fever,</v>

644
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.760
<v Speaker 1>nothing really terrible compared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>liver cirrhosis,</v>

645
00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:51.800
<v Speaker 1>but for sure unpleasant and now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the question,</v>

646
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.710
<v Speaker 1>liver really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Injections,</v>

647
00:32:55.711 --> 00:33:00.310
<v Speaker 1>slightly important but now in for</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain and that's basically the trade</v>

648
00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:02.540
<v Speaker 1>off we have everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about saving,</v>

649
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.910
<v Speaker 1>not good for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for the future.</v>

650
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Exercising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good for now,</v>

651
00:33:06.921 --> 00:33:08.150
<v Speaker 1>good for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dieting,</v>

652
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.670
<v Speaker 1>not good for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for the future,</v>

653
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.570
<v Speaker 1>safe sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so good for now,</v>

654
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:12.500
<v Speaker 1>good for the future.</v>

655
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Lots of things have this trade off in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of that when we face these</v>

656
00:33:16.581 --> 00:33:19.160
<v Speaker 1>tradeoffs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we often do what's called the present</v>

657
00:33:19.161 --> 00:33:22.670
<v Speaker 1>bias focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We focus on the present too much and as</v>

658
00:33:22.671 --> 00:33:25.990
<v Speaker 1>a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we undermine the long term,</v>

659
00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.870
<v Speaker 1>the long term effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the problem with Adam and eve</v>

660
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.400
<v Speaker 1>and you can ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

661
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:35.750
<v Speaker 1>who would ever give in eternity in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>garden of Eden for an apple?</v>

662
00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ever texted and drive at the same</v>

663
00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:40.370
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you basically have done this mistake,</v>

664
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most people have texted while</v>

665
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.070
<v Speaker 1>driving and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

666
00:33:45.071 --> 00:33:47.870
<v Speaker 1>and why do we do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not because we weigh the cost</v>

667
00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:51.440
<v Speaker 1>benefit analysis and we say it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good idea to text while driving.</v>

668
00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:55.100
<v Speaker 1>It's because we're tempted at the moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do something that we realized it was</v>

669
00:33:55.101 --> 00:33:57.530
<v Speaker 1>really stupid from the longterm</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

670
00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to my story,</v>

671
00:34:00.141 --> 00:34:02.000
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after a year and a half,</v>

672
00:34:02.001 --> 00:34:03.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were two pieces of good news.</v>

673
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:08.060
<v Speaker 1>The first one was that my liver was</v>
<v Speaker 1>working fine and there was no trace of</v>

674
00:34:08.061 --> 00:34:10.730
<v Speaker 1>the disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the second thing is that doctors</v>

675
00:34:10.731 --> 00:34:14.570
<v Speaker 1>told me was that I was the only patient</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I ever had who took the medication</v>

676
00:34:14.571 --> 00:34:16.760
<v Speaker 1>on time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

677
00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:19.700
<v Speaker 1>how could I do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I have nerves of steel and might not</v>

678
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.170
<v Speaker 1>succumb to the imputation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is,</v>

679
00:34:21.171 --> 00:34:23.570
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also come to temptation all the time.</v>

680
00:34:23.571 --> 00:34:28.160
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I did was I found a trick in my</v>

681
00:34:28.161 --> 00:34:30.020
<v Speaker 1>trick is that I love movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had time,</v>

682
00:34:30.021 --> 00:34:34.340
<v Speaker 1>I watched lots and lots of movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so every Monday,</v>

683
00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday and Friday on the way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

684
00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I would stop at a video store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would run two or three videos.</v>

685
00:34:38.781 --> 00:34:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I really wanted to see how with carry</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in my backpack the whole day.</v>

686
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Anticipating watching them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would get home,</v>

687
00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.600
<v Speaker 1>I would give myself the injection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would push a video in.</v>

688
00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:49.760
<v Speaker 1>I would get the bucket that we get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>blanket.</v>

689
00:34:49.761 --> 00:34:52.550
<v Speaker 1>I was already to the side effect and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>will start the video immediately.</v>

690
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:54.740
<v Speaker 1>I would wait for the side effect to</v>
<v Speaker 1>settle in.</v>

691
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:58.760
<v Speaker 1>I started immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can ask yourself,</v>

692
00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:02.150
<v Speaker 1>do they really care about my liver?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is no.</v>

693
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.080
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that delivery is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>important in me and all the other</v>

694
00:35:06.081 --> 00:35:09.560
<v Speaker 1>patients should have kept on taking your</v>
<v Speaker 1>medication on time because of the liver,</v>

695
00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.470
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't strong enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did I do?</v>

696
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:17.000
<v Speaker 1>I substituted deliver with movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say this is a stupid idea.</v>

697
00:35:17.001 --> 00:35:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Liver is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Movies not that crucial.</v>

698
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:21.680
<v Speaker 1>If you asked me what do I prefer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies or liver,</v>

699
00:35:21.681 --> 00:35:22.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no question,</v>

700
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.570
<v Speaker 1>but because deliveries in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was vastly discounted because the</v>

701
00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:30.230
<v Speaker 1>movies were in immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was actually motivating me and we</v>

702
00:35:30.231 --> 00:35:35.231
<v Speaker 1>call this reward substitution when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>behave as if I care about my liver by</v>

703
00:35:35.751 --> 00:35:40.230
<v Speaker 1>actually caring about movies and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actually a big lesson though.</v>

704
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:45.420
<v Speaker 1>You can think about how do we get people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to care about their health and money and</v>

705
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:50.040
<v Speaker 1>a longevity and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we really get people to wake up</v>

706
00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:53.070
<v Speaker 1>everyday and care about those things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That will happen 30 years from now.</v>

707
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:57.630
<v Speaker 1>The answer is really very difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive and unlikely,</v>

708
00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.720
<v Speaker 1>but can we find other reward</v>
<v Speaker 1>substitution?</v>

709
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Can we get people to behave because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other things in a way that would make</v>

710
00:36:05.611 --> 00:36:08.880
<v Speaker 1>them behave as if they care about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are doing for.</v>

711
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.730
<v Speaker 1>So why do people go to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

712
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Do they really wake up every morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>worrying about how they will look,</v>

713
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:18.240
<v Speaker 1>feel like 30 years from now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not,</v>

714
00:36:18.241 --> 00:36:22.050
<v Speaker 1>but can we get them to do some of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the moment that actually get them</v>

715
00:36:22.051 --> 00:36:26.310
<v Speaker 1>to behave because they do something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes them care about behaviors if they</v>

716
00:36:26.311 --> 00:36:29.910
<v Speaker 1>care about something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that reward substitution</v>

717
00:36:29.911 --> 00:36:33.710
<v Speaker 1>actually provides a general answer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of problems in,</v>

718
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.080
<v Speaker 1>in human behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just need to find out what these</v>

719
00:36:37.081 --> 00:36:38.520
<v Speaker 1>rewards can be.</v>

720
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about the question of</v>

721
00:36:43.891 --> 00:36:45.660
<v Speaker 1>trust and revenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great example,</v>

722
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that we're live in a</v>

723
00:36:47.131 --> 00:36:50.040
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're inherently social animals,</v>

724
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:54.750
<v Speaker 1>unlike some other species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because of that we need things that</v>

725
00:36:54.751 --> 00:36:59.250
<v Speaker 1>kind of connects us in a social way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have this social utility in which</v>

726
00:36:59.251 --> 00:37:02.940
<v Speaker 1>we just care about other people now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's create lots of problems.</v>

727
00:37:02.941 --> 00:37:05.130
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do a favor to me,</v>

728
00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.030
<v Speaker 1>I like you more and then it might put me</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

729
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.990
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in conflict of interest because they</v>

730
00:37:09.991 --> 00:37:14.991
<v Speaker 1>would want to reciprocate in some way or</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a trust and revenge and all of those</v>

731
00:37:15.871 --> 00:37:18.210
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the fact is that there are some</v>

732
00:37:18.211 --> 00:37:22.050
<v Speaker 1>things that we are irrational and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have liked to fix it,</v>

733
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:25.710
<v Speaker 1>but there are some things where</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrationalities actually what allows us</v>

734
00:37:25.711 --> 00:37:30.711
<v Speaker 1>to live in a society and if we lived as</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual organisms that basically had</v>

735
00:37:30.811 --> 00:37:33.900
<v Speaker 1>no social ties and we're just working</v>
<v Speaker 1>each one of us separately,</v>

736
00:37:33.901 --> 00:37:36.270
<v Speaker 1>it will be a very different social</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

737
00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:39.990
<v Speaker 1>but we might want to actually have</v>
<v Speaker 1>different strategies for decision</v>

738
00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:40.290
<v Speaker 1>making.</v>

739
00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:42.840
<v Speaker 1>But because we're inherently social</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

740
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:47.520
<v Speaker 1>there's all kinds of things that make</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are irrational from the perspective</v>

741
00:37:47.521 --> 00:37:49.980
<v Speaker 1>of thinking that everybody's a social is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

742
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:54.450
<v Speaker 1>is a selfish maximizer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nevertheless make sense when you</v>

743
00:37:54.451 --> 00:37:57.750
<v Speaker 1>think about people as social items.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing of course is about</v>

744
00:37:57.751 --> 00:38:01.350
<v Speaker 1>processing information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the fact is that we have a limited</v>

745
00:38:01.351 --> 00:38:02.070
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

746
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:04.650
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of limited physically in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

747
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can jump very high.</v>

748
00:38:06.571 --> 00:38:08.910
<v Speaker 1>We can't sustain cold or heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

749
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:11.940
<v Speaker 1>think about all the stuff in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we do to make yourself more</v>

750
00:38:11.941 --> 00:38:15.660
<v Speaker 1>comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have chairs and clothes and glasses</v>

751
00:38:15.661 --> 00:38:16.500
<v Speaker 1>and headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

752
00:38:16.501 --> 00:38:19.980
<v Speaker 1>lots and lots of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out our brain is also not</v>

753
00:38:19.981 --> 00:38:20.621
<v Speaker 1>perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

754
00:38:20.621 --> 00:38:22.500
<v Speaker 1>In the same way that our bodies are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect,</v>

755
00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.080
<v Speaker 1>we can't do everything we would like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

756
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:27.090
<v Speaker 1>We're not superman and our brain is also</v>
<v Speaker 1>not perfect.</v>

757
00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Our brains process information in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain way,</v>

758
00:38:29.131 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 1>and the reality that we experience is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not out there.</v>

759
00:38:31.651 --> 00:38:33.480
<v Speaker 1>It's in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what gives us the.</v>

760
00:38:33.481 --> 00:38:38.481
<v Speaker 1>The brain gives us the world brought to</v>
<v Speaker 1>us courtesy of our brain and it's</v>

761
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:44.020
<v Speaker 1>processing ability and because the brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not perfect,</v>

762
00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:48.310
<v Speaker 1>the way we get information and process</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is also not perfect and that's just</v>

763
00:38:48.311 --> 00:38:53.311
<v Speaker 1>kind of functional structural</v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations to how rational we can be.</v>

764
00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:57.990
<v Speaker 1>And the fact is that we better recognize</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's really good to recognize it,</v>

765
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.610
<v Speaker 1>understand the limitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then act accordingly.</v>

766
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Because if we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just make more and more mistake.</v>

767
00:39:03.851 --> 00:39:05.620
<v Speaker 1>We'll just assume that we can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

768
00:39:05.621 --> 00:39:07.780
<v Speaker 1>We'll create the world as if people</v>
<v Speaker 1>would create,</v>

769
00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.310
<v Speaker 1>can be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll just set ourselves to this</v>

770
00:39:10.311 --> 00:39:11.590
<v Speaker 1>appointment time after time.</v>
