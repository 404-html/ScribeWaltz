00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.340
<v Speaker 2>well my advice is really to follow your</v>
<v Speaker 2>passion.</v>

3
00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:16.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean study something that interests</v>
<v Speaker 2>you but also qualifies you to apply.</v>

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

5
00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:19.990
<v Speaker 2>NASA recruits from a wide variety of</v>
<v Speaker 2>backgrounds.</v>

6
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.560
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a bachelor's degree at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least in science or engineering.</v>

7
00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:23.980
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

8
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.540
<v Speaker 2>pick the field that you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

9
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people who have applied to be</v>

10
00:00:27.971 --> 00:00:29.530
<v Speaker 2>astronauts who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who asked me,</v>

11
00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:30.490
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should I do this,</v>

12
00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 2>should I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

13
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.620
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

14
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 2>The basic requirements are you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be in good health and you have to have a</v>

15
00:00:36.221 --> 00:00:38.110
<v Speaker 2>good heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

16
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.840
<v Speaker 2>in a technical way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so much be a kind person while,</v>

17
00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:42.220
<v Speaker 2>although that helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

18
00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:43.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

19
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.070
<v Speaker 2>study something that you like and do</v>
<v Speaker 2>well in it.</v>
