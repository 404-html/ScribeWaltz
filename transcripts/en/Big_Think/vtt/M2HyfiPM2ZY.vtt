00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.140
<v Speaker 1>I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would like to</v>

2
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.643
<v Speaker 1>see</v>

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.850
<v Speaker 2>how he managed to maintain his</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm,</v>

4
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 2>his peace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his creativity,</v>

5
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:26.901
<v Speaker 2>and his compassion in the face of a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>cruelty in the face of apartheid,</v>

6
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.530
<v Speaker 2>in the face of hatred and injustice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because at no time did Mr Mandela</v>

7
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.370
<v Speaker 2>contribute to the melodrama by adding</v>
<v Speaker 2>his anger to it.</v>

8
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 2>And that is where he's looked at one in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world as a hero.</v>

9
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if there's any other living</v>
<v Speaker 2>person that I can think of right now</v>

10
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

11
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>still.</v>
