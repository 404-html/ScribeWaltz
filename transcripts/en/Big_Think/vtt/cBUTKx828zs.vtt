1
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.520
<v Speaker 1>The idea at the end of the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it started with George Hw Bush and</v>

2
00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:14.521
<v Speaker 1>then continued with Bill Clinton was</v>
<v Speaker 1>what George Hw Bush called it a Europe</v>

3
00:00:15.011 --> 00:00:17.740
<v Speaker 1>whole and free Clinton called it a</v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful,</v>

4
00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:21.670
<v Speaker 1>undivided democratic Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea was let's take advantage of the</v>

5
00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:26.410
<v Speaker 1>end of the Cold War to remove the</v>
<v Speaker 1>division in Europe and bring the former</v>

6
00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:31.000
<v Speaker 1>communist part of Europe into the rest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrate it into the rest of Europe.</v>

7
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.900
<v Speaker 1>And there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>there was the effort with central and</v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern Europe to bring those new</v>

9
00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:42.460
<v Speaker 1>democracies in there where the wars in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Balkans,</v>

10
00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:44.770
<v Speaker 1>in Bosnia and Kosovo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.420
<v Speaker 1>to try to end the repression that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>being carried out by the government in</v>

12
00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Serbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.680
<v Speaker 1>to try to move you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the former Yugoslavia onto a different</v>

14
00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:56.830
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Russia part was related to this,</v>

15
00:00:56.831 --> 00:01:00.220
<v Speaker 1>trying to bring Russia closer as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But especially on NATO,</v>

16
00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:05.221
<v Speaker 1>the idea was that the United States</v>
<v Speaker 1>could use this alliance to help anchor</v>

17
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>countries like Poland and Hungary and</v>
<v Speaker 1>others in central and eastern Europe</v>

18
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 1>into the West.</v>

19
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Because basically what NATO said to</v>
<v Speaker 1>those countries was if you can develop</v>

20
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>democracy and markets and respect for</v>
<v Speaker 1>human rights and and respect for borders</v>

21
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.090
<v Speaker 1>that you can join this organization but</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to carry out internal reforms</v>

22
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.020
<v Speaker 1>in order to join NATO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was hugely important for the</v>

23
00:01:35.021 --> 00:01:39.070
<v Speaker 1>stability of central and eastern Europe</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a huge success story after the Cold</v>

24
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.070
<v Speaker 1>War that these young democracies did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they built democ democratic</v>

25
00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:49.470
<v Speaker 1>market oriented states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protected human rights and you know,</v>

26
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.630
<v Speaker 1>agreed that they weren't going to change</v>
<v Speaker 1>borders and it,</v>

27
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.510
<v Speaker 1>because there were a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of issues from how those borders</v>

28
00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:59.350
<v Speaker 1>had been drawn decades before that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were worried about him.</v>

29
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

30
00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Hungary and Romania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.320
<v Speaker 1>worked out their issues and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries were able to join NATO,</v>

32
00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:12.730
<v Speaker 1>which gave the European Union more</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence about the stability in that</v>

33
00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:15.940
<v Speaker 1>part of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which enabled those countries in 2004 to</v>

34
00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:19.360
<v Speaker 1>join the European Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>

35
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.280
<v Speaker 1>has really been in terms of the American</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort to promote democracy after the</v>

36
00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:25.114
<v Speaker 1>end of the Cold War.</v>

37
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Central Eastern Europe really is one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the huge success stories.</v>

38
00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.400
<v Speaker 1>should have been sort of a cautionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>tale about what was required because a</v>

40
00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:41.401
<v Speaker 1>lot of the people in the George h w Bush</v>
<v Speaker 1>administration in the period of 89 to 91</v>

41
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.060
<v Speaker 1>who were there when central Eastern</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe started on this path saw and in</v>

42
00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:50.500
<v Speaker 1>central and eastern Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:02:50.501 --> 00:02:54.370
<v Speaker 1>the bad guys were toppled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Statues were pulled down and the</v>

44
00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:57.670
<v Speaker 1>populations really wanted to join the</v>
<v Speaker 1>west.</v>

45
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.180
<v Speaker 1>And when these guys are end after 2001,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking at Iraq and they're</v>

46
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it the way they saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>things in central and eastern Europe.</v>

47
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>You get rid of the regime and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>topless statues and the population</v>

48
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>welcomes you as liberator's and wants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>join the west.</v>

49
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>And they really took the wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less,</v>

50
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less than a central eastern Europe was</v>

51
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:22.510
<v Speaker 1>how much assistance was required,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much,</v>

52
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 1>how important it was that you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions like NATO and the European</v>

53
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Union that could help bring these</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries in,</v>

54
00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>in these countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really saw themselves as,</v>

55
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>as part of the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they had been denied that by</v>

56
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

57
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.810
<v Speaker 1>things didn't turn out that way in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>raft.</v>

59
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.080
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
