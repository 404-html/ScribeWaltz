1
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Let me outline four different possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanations one can give and,</v>

2
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I will just leave it,</v>

3
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>leave it to the audience too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reflect on,</v>

4
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:21.171
<v Speaker 1>on these four possible explanations for</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we've had this extraordinary run of,</v>

5
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.901
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

6
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:24.780
<v Speaker 1>of bubbles and busts over the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of decades.</v>

7
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.760
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first one,</v>

8
00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:28.610
<v Speaker 1>which one might describe as sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 1>the left wing or liberal answer is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has,</v>

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>it has basically been driven by reckless</v>
<v Speaker 1>lending,</v>

11
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.290
<v Speaker 1>lack of regulation and greed and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.640
<v Speaker 1>and that in effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire boom since,</v>

13
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the early Reagan years in 1982 was</v>

14
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:47.820
<v Speaker 1>basically driven by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.043
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>by this escalating leverage that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect was more fake than rail.</v>

17
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.661
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>it is basically come to an end and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>it worked well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did,</v>

21
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.700
<v Speaker 1>but it was basically the fault of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>of the lenders and all kinds of agency</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems associated with them.</v>

23
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

24
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>there's a second type of political</v>
<v Speaker 1>events which is the right wing or</v>

25
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 1>conservative answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that it basically was the fault</v>

26
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 1>of the borrowers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were recklessly borrowing all</v>

27
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>this money and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was people who were too greedy and</v>

28
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>buying houses and going on credit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 1>and that it was sort of the product of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic and selfish generation</v>

30
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:29.514
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>was not with short sighted and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the future.</v>

32
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 1>And under that sort of a narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might trace things back to say 19,</v>

33
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:39.110
<v Speaker 1>68 a and say that was the year that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything went downhill in the u.</v>

34
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>s and the hippies took over or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

35
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.140
<v Speaker 1>something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I think there's a,</v>

36
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.240
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

37
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>the case of these two explanations are</v>
<v Speaker 1>not inconsistent and it is possible that</v>

38
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:50.840
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were problems with both the</v>

39
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>lenders and the borrowers and that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>

40
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was something about,</v>

41
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>something deeper about the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>political system which have failed to</v>

43
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>proactively deal with these things.</v>

44
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>And just us speaking up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking on my,</v>

45
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>in my own context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was obvious that there was an insane</v>

47
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:12.270
<v Speaker 1>housing bubble three years ago and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could talk about it,</v>

48
00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>you could scream about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could go on CNBC and tell people,</v>

49
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a housing bubble,</v>

50
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>they should not buy houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like shouting into a</v>

51
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was willing to listen.</v>

52
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.990
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.020
<v Speaker 1>and there is something about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

54
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.820
<v Speaker 1>the nature of these things that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily a pro cyclical in a bad</v>

55
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 1>way in terms of our political system</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

56
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>when there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there is,</v>

57
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 1>when everything's going well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the regulations get loosened,</v>

58
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.270
<v Speaker 1>when things are going badly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get tightened.</v>

59
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>So that in effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the political process has had the effect</v>

60
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>of dampening these bubbles and booms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually exacerbating them</v>

61
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 1>tremendously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that is going to be one of</v>

62
00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>the real serious challenges we faced in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the years ahead in the technology</v>

63
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

64
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the late nineties,</v>

65
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:56.851
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

66
00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:57.684
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were obviously tremendous.</v>

68
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>We dealt with the abuses with Sarbanes</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oxley and there've been basically no</v>

69
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tech Ipos are virtually no tech Ipos</v>

70
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>in six years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had,</v>

71
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 1>we had an excess of boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the regulators did nothing and then we</v>

72
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>had an excess of Boston and we had an</v>
<v Speaker 1>overreaction and uh,</v>

73
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>and again you can blame it on special</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest groups that are serving the</v>

74
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:23.030
<v Speaker 1>lenders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can blame it on,</v>

75
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the desire of the borrowers to keep</v>

76
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:29.780
<v Speaker 1>the easy money going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when basically a,</v>

77
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>both of them and you have to wonder how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how this,</v>

78
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>how this can better be handled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the challenges,</v>

79
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:36.994
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 1>that is happening on a global scale is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the inability of our political</v>

81
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:46.531
<v Speaker 1>system to proactively deal with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>bubbles is calling into question the</v>

82
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>very concept of democratic capitalism.</v>

83
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the challenges in the next,</v>

84
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next four to five years is that as sort</v>

85
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>of a more authoritarian version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism,</v>

86
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>of the sort that one sees in China will</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a lot more appeal.</v>

87
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>Because the argument will be that it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to,</v>

88
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to resist the,</v>

89
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:06.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the appeal of,</v>

90
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people and special interests groups,</v>

91
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of act on behalf of the whole</v>

92
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the challenge for the next</v>

93
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:16.500
<v Speaker 1>president is going to be to somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

94
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 1>rehabilitate the good name of democratic</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism.</v>

95
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:20.231
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:22.090
<v Speaker 1>it will be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be quite a big challenge.</v>

97
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>And I certainly hope that whoever</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes president will succeed at that.</v>

98
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.771
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

99
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outline a fourth,</v>

100
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 1>a possible explanation for why so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these bubbles have turned into bus.</v>

101
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 1>And this is probably my own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my own personal hobby.</v>

102
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Hoarseness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that there's not been enough</v>

103
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 1>real growth in the economy and that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>

104
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 1>the reason so many of these booms didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>work was that the whole economy was not</v>

105
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 1>growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is not a question about finance</v>

106
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:53.410
<v Speaker 1>or politics or regulation or at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>not centrally about those,</v>

107
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.970
<v Speaker 1>but about science and technology and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate at which science and technology are</v>

108
00:04:57.971 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 1>progressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

109
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:00.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think sort of one,</v>

110
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while there's incredible hype</v>

111
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 1>surrounding tech companies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific innovation,</v>

112
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.690
<v Speaker 1>the reality has simply not lived up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hype for a very long time.</v>

113
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

114
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.990
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

115
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anecdote I would cite as if we were</v>

116
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.140
<v Speaker 1>sitting in this room in 1968 and talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what was the future of the US</v>

117
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.910
<v Speaker 1>going to look like in 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

118
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would have predicted the cation trips</v>

119
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:25.144
<v Speaker 1>to the moon.</v>

120
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm a space spaceships on Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

121
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.960
<v Speaker 1>massive increases in productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zerbe on triber,</v>

122
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:35.200
<v Speaker 1>a European writer wrote the American</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge in 1967.</v>

123
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.460
<v Speaker 1>He said that by the year 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average person,</v>

124
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.240
<v Speaker 1>the US will be working seven hours a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

125
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.630
<v Speaker 1>four days a week and have 13 weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year of paid vacation time.</v>

126
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.590
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

127
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.670
<v Speaker 1>which was a reflection of the incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth in productivity that was set to</v>

128
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 1>take place by accelerating technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>and science and I,</v>

129
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>and it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's gone the other way.</v>

130
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.100
<v Speaker 1>There's not been enough progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

131
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 1>I think the longterm challenge that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would submit is that we somehow need to,</v>

132
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>to get that restarted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is very,</v>

133
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.670
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

134
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

135
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.440
<v Speaker 1>it's broken down for a lot of very</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated reasons,</v>

136
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>but I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in some sense,</v>

137
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the kind of thing that,</v>

138
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.150
<v Speaker 1>that needs to be very much restarted.</v>

139
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 1>If I had a last thought on this is if</v>
<v Speaker 1>one had to look at the whole series of</v>

140
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 1>bubbles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that I think was the central</v>

141
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps not just in time,</v>

142
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 1>but also in importance was the tech</v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble of the late nineties.</v>

143
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.260
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense when that one turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to go wrong,</v>

144
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 1>it meant that none of them would work</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if there was not going to be</v>

145
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:40.910
<v Speaker 1>exponential progress in technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing else made sense and you could</v>

146
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 1>leverage up in housing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But eventually housing prices would go</v>

147
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:47.450
<v Speaker 1>down if there was no real growth in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>society taking place.</v>

148
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 1>And the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's true of a finance and to a</v>

149
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:52.920
<v Speaker 1>lesser extent of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

150
00:06:52.921 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 1>the emerging market of the emerging</v>
<v Speaker 1>market story.</v>

151
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.820
<v Speaker 1>So I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would encourage us to very seriously</v>

152
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 1>rethink why there's been so little</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress and how that can be</v>

153
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:04.790
<v Speaker 1>accelerated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is certainly one of the</v>

154
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:07.520
<v Speaker 1>great things that a big thing as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>impetus for doing.</v>
