1
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Wealthy corporations and people love to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask the question,</v>

2
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.640
<v Speaker 1>what can I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What should we do?</v>

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>What can we start?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What program could we launch?</v>

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I would say to the billionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change agents and corporate corporate</v>

5
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.620
<v Speaker 1>social responsibility departments of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Ask not what you can do for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

7
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Ask what you've already done to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

8
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before you want to start something of</v>

9
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>your own little private,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unaccountable venture.</v>

10
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Do an audit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you pay people.</v>

11
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>You pay people enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you use subcontractors to avoid</v>

12
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for those workers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you pay benefits?</v>

13
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>When do your benefits kick in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you lobby for in Washington?</v>

14
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you lobby for things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>make everybody have a better life in</v>

15
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:59.721
<v Speaker 1>America or do lobby against social</v>
<v Speaker 1>policies that would cost you something?</v>

16
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>What's your tax avoidance situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>

17
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:04.220
<v Speaker 1>do you happen to be this ernest company</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

18
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>that that wants to change the world?</v>

19
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this company paying its full measure</v>

20
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>of taxes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it use tax havens?</v>

21
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Does it do the double Dutch with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irish Sandwich tax maneuver?</v>

22
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Does it send money that came in islands</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then back and do all this complex</v>

23
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>routing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're telling me that there are</v>

24
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:24.420
<v Speaker 1>companies that do none of this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pay people well,</v>

25
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>that don't dump externalities into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>

26
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 1>that don't cause social problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there is such companies exist.</v>

27
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then once you've taken care of all that,</v>

28
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing some some projects to help people</v>

29
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>is great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't found very many such</v>

30
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>companies and more often than not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when companies do a lot of CSR,</v>

31
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.490
<v Speaker 1>it's because they understand that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not on the right side of justice</v>

32
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>in their day operations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they want to do virtual as a side</v>

33
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>hustle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is a lot of these</v>

34
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>companies tend to create harm in</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions and then do good in the</v>

35
00:01:56.731 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>millions and you don't need to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematician to know that we're the</v>

36
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>losers from that bargain.</v>

37
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>And you'd look at the b Corp Movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of companies that actually</v>

38
00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:10.050
<v Speaker 1>have an interest in trying to invent a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new kind of company that is not</v>

39
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>predatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's in the B Corp Movement,</v>

40
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 1>a certification process for those</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

41
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Now the challenges of them is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great thing,</v>

42
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>but it's fundamentally voluntary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what this does is it means that if</v>

43
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.390
<v Speaker 1>on already good virtuous company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may be motivated to get into this</v>

45
00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're Exxon or Pepsi,</v>

46
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be in this club.</v>

48
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I'd like to see is how</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we actually use the power of public</v>

49
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:41.481
<v Speaker 1>policy to get more companies to sign up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to simply not dump harm,</v>

50
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>social harm into our society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether that takes the form of toxic</v>

51
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:51.470
<v Speaker 1>sludge or obese children or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>workers with unpredictable hours and</v>
<v Speaker 1>income.</v>

53
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>And in the B Corp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a model of a company that looks</v>

54
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have any kind of compulsion</v>

55
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

56
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Senator Elizabeth Warren has a proposal</v>

57
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>out to turn every American Corporation</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a b Corp as a condition for,</v>

58
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting a corporate charter.</v>

59
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>I think there's less radical option that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes talk about,</v>

60
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:19.231
<v Speaker 1>which is why don't we just have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different and lower corporate tax rate</v>

61
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.810
<v Speaker 1>for companies that in a certifiable way</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't dump huge social problems onto the</v>

62
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Commons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

63
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>and that that way we might see thousands</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thousands of companies electing to</v>

64
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.230
<v Speaker 1>certified benefit corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>in order to avail of that lower tax</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate.</v>

67
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:41.161
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to start thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we attack one of the root causes of</v>

68
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:43.410
<v Speaker 1>this kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

69
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>grading malfeasance in American life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is shareholder primacy and the</v>

70
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>fact that many companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even ones that want to be better,</v>

71
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 1>are at risk of violating their</v>
<v Speaker 1>shareholders' rights by doing so.</v>

72
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think we can do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>strictly by creating a voluntary,</v>

73
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool of better companies.</v>

74
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to start using our</v>
<v Speaker 1>leverage of society to say,</v>

75
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>if you want the benefits that we as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>society give you when you become a</v>

76
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what we want in return.</v>
