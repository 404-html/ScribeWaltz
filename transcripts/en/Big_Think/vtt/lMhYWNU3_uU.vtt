<v Speaker 1>separate pieces that are put together.</v>

11
00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:35.080
<v Speaker 1>That's what the American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think great contribution to fashion</v>

12
00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:37.000

<v Speaker 1>do well.</v>

14
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.320

<v Speaker 1>that's the English point of view.</v>

21
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Italians are,</v>

<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are known for craftsmanship.</v>

23
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.590
<v Speaker 1>It's the fabrics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the ability to make beautiful</v>

24
00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:11.110
<v Speaker 1>clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the Italians have always</v>

25

<v Speaker 1>known how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great leather goods,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful suits.</v>

29
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.350
<v Speaker 1>That's what Italians too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what they do best as well.</v>

30
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get to Paris and that's</v>

31
00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:22.960
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>the magic city of all in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the couture exists.</v>

33
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Those one of a kind dresses that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>French put out twice a year,</v>

34
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really a more of what's factory</v>

35
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:36.370
<v Speaker 1>for extraordinary design in fashion that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is only really in,</v>

36
00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:38.150
<v Speaker 1>in Paris and supported by the French</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

37
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.950
<v Speaker 1>and even by the French government and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French have in there.</v>

38
00:01:41.951 --> 00:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the water,</v>

39
00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker 1>it's in the wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the baguette.</v>

40
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.450
<v Speaker 1>it's in their DNA.</v>

42
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.790
<v Speaker 1>A sense of style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sense of that being important.</v>

43
00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:51.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French fashion is a port of French</v>

44
00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 1>culture in the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American flag is a symbol of him</v>

46
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:57.880
<v Speaker 1>being an American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.510
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a part of who they are.</v>

48
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.590
<v Speaker 1>I think they do it better than anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

49
00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:05.930
<v Speaker 1>And I think their level of understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it is,</v>

50
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:07.970
<v Speaker 1>is more sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if the designer,</v>

51
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Stephanopoulos and Italian Alber bows</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>

52
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't Israeli,</v>

53
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:13.840
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are both designing for houses in</v>

54
00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:16.420
<v Speaker 1>power as they are in that culture there</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that world.</v>

55
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Bark Jacobs does Louie Vito.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

56
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.231
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:02:20.231 --> 00:02:23.590
<v Speaker 1>you get absorbed into that French ethos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that femininity,</v>

58
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the understanding of quality and</v>

59
00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:29.530
<v Speaker 1>craftsmanship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work that are still there that do</v>

60
00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:33.760
<v Speaker 1>the beautiful embroidery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr lasage doesn't happen anywhere else</v>

61
00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:36.700
<v Speaker 1>on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think along with the French</v>

62
00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>government supporting French fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.160
<v Speaker 1>it's just a city that really does</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and they have I think</v>

64
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.720
<v Speaker 1>basically the best clothes on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

65
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they care about it.</v>

66
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.261
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:48.261 --> 00:02:52.130
<v Speaker 1>the French woman traditionally goes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>buys a couple of pieces each season</v>

68
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 1>jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe coat new pair of boots,</v>

69
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:58.400
<v Speaker 1>a skirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she wears that for the six months.</v>

70
00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 1>And she really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those few things because then with her</v>

71
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>old pieces and then get something new in</v>
<v Speaker 1>spring,</v>

72
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 1>American women don't tend to buy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

73
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>They tend to buy more things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't tend to buy investment</v>

74
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

75
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 1>I think American women would tend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make more mistakes and what they buy.</v>

76
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there there's a different philosophy.</v>

77
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in the culture as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think French women are brought up to</v>

78
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>care more about that in a way that seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be more part of what's important.</v>

79
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>And that might have to do with something</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper sociological,</v>

80
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 1>psychological relationship that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have with men in their society.</v>

81
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the female relationship is,</v>

82
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 1>how men view women and sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a slightly more Latin point of</v>

83
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that in my mind,</v>

84
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 1>might indicate why the women are a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little more interested in their style</v>

85
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:47.764
<v Speaker 1>and their,</v>

86
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.360
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
