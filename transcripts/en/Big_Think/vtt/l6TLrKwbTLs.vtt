1
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.960
<v Speaker 1>So one explanation that people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>performed over the years for the spooky</v>

2
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:10.170
<v Speaker 1>connections and for quantum mechanics</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually in general,</v>

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>is that it's an indication we live in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiverse and other words that there</v>

4
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>are other domains of gals out there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have only very dim glimpse of quantum</v>

5
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 1>mechanics says that when I measure</v>
<v Speaker 1>particle,</v>

6
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I get a random result and doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>any explanation for that random result.</v>

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.160
<v Speaker 1>So if I flip a quantum coin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes up heads or tails and I see</v>

8
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the strange thing is the mathematics</v>

9
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>says I should see heads and tails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's always been a mystery of why I</v>

10
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:44.500
<v Speaker 1>see one or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The proposition is that actually that</v>

11
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>the coin does come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heads entails,</v>

12
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>but it comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heads in our universe entails another</v>

13
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:54.550
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea of different universes of</v>

14
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.570
<v Speaker 1>parallel universes is a way to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of the multiplicity of outcomes or</v>

15
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>observed in quantum mechanics.</v>

16
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.060
<v Speaker 1>And people have proposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this would be a way to actually kind of</v>

17
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>get rid of the non locality that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonlocality the spooky action at a</v>

18
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:13.671
<v Speaker 1>distance is actually our kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>imperfect glimpse of a,</v>

19
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>a multiverse of parallel universes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that individually those universes all</v>

20
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>behave completely locally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no spooky action and I kind of actually</v>

21
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of sympathy for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

22
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Actually is kind of awesome to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be parallel universes not</v>

23
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:32.781
<v Speaker 1>just out there but actually in here that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can be kind of just cheek by jowl</v>

24
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>with parallel universes all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'd never even sent them that eve.</v>

25
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Any measurement we make what caused the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of branch parallel universes</v>

26
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:46.170
<v Speaker 1>to just be conjured up all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of an amazing kind of</v>

27
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.200
<v Speaker 1>conception of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've kind of gone off the idea as</v>

28
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:49.960
<v Speaker 1>much as I kind of.</v>

29
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm drawn to it initially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the the reason is that I think that</v>

30
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>when you see these spooky actions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>locality in a broader context,</v>

31
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the context of other places where</v>

32
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>they occur in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just for the particles,</v>

33
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>but they also assumed to occur for black</v>
<v Speaker 1>holes that seemed to happen in</v>

34
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>cosmology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem to happen in the workings of</v>

35
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a variety of contexts in which</v>

36
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.940
<v Speaker 1>you see spooky actions and those other</v>
<v Speaker 1>contexts are harder to explain in this</v>

37
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>kind of parallel universe scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they really seem to point to is</v>

38
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.260
<v Speaker 1>that space and time are derivative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real message of the spooky action is</v>

39
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>is that space and time are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental.</v>

40
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Particles are rooted in that deeper</v>
<v Speaker 1>layer where space and time don't yet</v>

41
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the way to explain them.</v>

42
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.920
<v Speaker 1>So the building blocks of the world may</v>
<v Speaker 1>not be tiny things.</v>

43
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.470
<v Speaker 1>What could these building blocks be if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not tiny?</v>

44
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Because that's kind of what we think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a building block of Lego is smaller</v>

45
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>than the thing you built out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legos.</v>

46
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>They may be in what seems to us enormous</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

47
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Things that spent the entire universe</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're somehow acting in concert</v>

48
00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:59.880
<v Speaker 1>with one another to produce these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these phenomena of space.</v>
