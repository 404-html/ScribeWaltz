1
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started out,</v>

2
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.950
<v Speaker 1>I was the first gang specialist about</v>
<v Speaker 1>state of Texas.</v>

3
00:00:11.951 --> 00:00:15.290
<v Speaker 1>My job was to essentially go into youth</v>
<v Speaker 1>prisons and Cellos,</v>

4
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.000
<v Speaker 1>young early adult prisons and deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gang phenomenon that happened in the</v>

5
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:22.630
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Job was to negotiate peace in those</v>

6
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.160
<v Speaker 1>environments and then furloughs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young man out and allow them to go back</v>

7
00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:31.720
<v Speaker 1>to the neighborhoods and top with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>ogs and their leaders to ask them to</v>

8
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.750
<v Speaker 1>give them free passage back into their</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

9
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.020
<v Speaker 1>And you know in this culture is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's less now.</v>

10
00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:41.950
<v Speaker 1>It's less gang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more a identity with whatever,</v>

11
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.990
<v Speaker 1>whatever area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever neighborhood,</v>

12
00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:46.390
<v Speaker 1>whatever scenario that you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

13
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.630
<v Speaker 1>you identify with that so that becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>your protection.</v>

14
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.560
<v Speaker 1>It becomes your identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes your way of life.</v>

15
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.090
<v Speaker 1>So someone has to figure out how to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through that system and say,</v>

16
00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:01.150
<v Speaker 1>let's get reality from those false</v>
<v Speaker 1>identities,</v>

17
00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:04.450
<v Speaker 1>those false and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta be careful because no</v>

18
00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:07.730
<v Speaker 1>matter if it's false or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone believes that they'll die for</v>

19
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll kill for their live for.</v>

20
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>So you have to know how to use whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence you have to bring about a</v>

21
00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:17.920
<v Speaker 1>different perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

22
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you one,</v>

23
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.940
<v Speaker 1>once I did a a gang negotiation with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>area and brotherhood,</v>

24
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The arrogant nation and Nazis and when</v>

25
00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:31.390
<v Speaker 1>they gathered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all had to affirm their belief</v>

26
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:33.790
<v Speaker 1>system and it was so interested in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

27
00:01:33.791 --> 00:01:38.090
<v Speaker 1>He looked around his group and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hate blacks and we hate,</v>

28
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.360
<v Speaker 1>we hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he looked at me.</v>

29
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:41.230
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not you,</v>

30
00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:41.800
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

31
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.510
<v Speaker 1>we don't feel like that about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

32
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>thank you man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what I realized what he said to</v>

33
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.690
<v Speaker 1>me was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

34
00:01:49.691 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>we need you right man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's do this.</v>

35
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.820
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a speech that's not</v>

36
00:01:54.821 --> 00:01:57.820
<v Speaker 1>necessarily interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

37
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.440
<v Speaker 1>and that guy became one of the leaders</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>

38
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.350
<v Speaker 1>your Emoji counsel that we did in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>prison,</v>

39
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:03.460
<v Speaker 1>which is a unity council.</v>

40
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>But the point I'm making is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that enemies calm when there is true</v>

41
00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:13.840
<v Speaker 1>violation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not true rhetoric.</v>

42
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.540
<v Speaker 1>The rhetoric don't make enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

43
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:17.720
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.440
<v Speaker 1>you gotta go past that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

45
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.500
<v Speaker 1>that there's some stuff that I promised</v>
<v Speaker 1>you I will not say on camera that me and</v>

46
00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:25.720
<v Speaker 1>my wife had all has argued about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think,</v>

47
00:02:25.721 --> 00:02:26.530
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are enemies.</v>

48
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.363
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

49
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.260
<v Speaker 1>she didn't want to get on TV and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to,</v>

50
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just got out of her hand.</v>

51
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.740
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes you have to go beyond the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhetoric so you can see the real and</v>

52
00:02:35.741 --> 00:02:37.930
<v Speaker 1>they're so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you got to classify a person with</v>

53
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.400
<v Speaker 1>enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their intent,</v>

54
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.830
<v Speaker 1>with that consistent behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

55
00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:43.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole broad range when you try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal like that.</v>

57
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.370
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

58
00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:51.370
<v Speaker 1>very careful when you're doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you never know who you're going</v>

59
00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.290
<v Speaker 1>to need on many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

60
00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:54.010
<v Speaker 1>many sides.</v>

61
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 1>So that's how I see enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you right about that.</v>

62
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.140
<v Speaker 1>It's very rather than my spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

63
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>as an enemy because when you can't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inner work,</v>

64
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:03.094
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

65
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>you will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will really limit your influence and</v>

66
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>limit your access if you thought in</v>
<v Speaker 1>those terms.</v>

67
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.451
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did work with Paul Ryan,</v>

69
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:14.870
<v Speaker 1>he was doing the poverty tool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:15.431
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone with a mentor,</v>

72
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 1>my mentor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Woodson,</v>

73
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>and it was called what works and why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was going around and see what</v>

74
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 1>really works and he had this idea called</v>
<v Speaker 1>a better way forward.</v>

75
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>And so they came to Dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no knowledge of him.</v>

76
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>He came to Dallas to come see my work</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of his first trips when he</v>

77
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>became speaker of the house was I do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big celebration every mlk.</v>

78
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>They've where outbrain healers from all</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the city of Dallas then,</v>

79
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>but now all over the nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came together,</v>

80
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.180
<v Speaker 1>suggests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>affirmed what we were doing and to read,</v>

81
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revisit where we were.</v>

82
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.500
<v Speaker 1>One of his first trips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came there and was that strictly</v>

83
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 1>listened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stayed for a few hours just listening</v>

84
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 1>to everyone and talking in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there in that space.</v>

85
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 1>And it was so interesting how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>perception was not the reality,</v>

86
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>because most people who work in</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods,</v>

87
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a philosophy that will say it</v>

88
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:14.490
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lean it on lean toward where you are</v>

89
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 1>fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was as comfortable in that moment</v>

90
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:22.891
<v Speaker 1>as I was when he brought us up to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a group of guys who are</v>

91
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:24.860
<v Speaker 1>conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

92
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did a deal at the American Enterprise</v>

93
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Institute and other places where we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>just trying to share our ideas.</v>

94
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 1>And what we saw when we started</v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing is there's not a lot of</v>

95
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:36.700
<v Speaker 1>separation and the separation is very</v>
<v Speaker 1>small.</v>

96
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.540
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

97
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 1>we began to just work in that in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

98
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

99
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.300
<v Speaker 1>perspective comes from where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never forget when Paul and I first</v>

100
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.120
<v Speaker 1>met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saying,</v>

101
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 1>what is he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is he trying to gain from this?</v>

102
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.990
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

103
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>and his direct answer was inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I don't know.</v>

104
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 1>So teach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show me what it means to be in this</v>

105
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm going to show you who I am.</v>

106
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 1>And then he said something that's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>

107
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.810
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Omar,</v>

108
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.030
<v Speaker 1>there are people who are poised to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

109
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>that you wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't meet,</v>

110
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 1>but I won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to introduce you to this world.</v>

111
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:18.350
<v Speaker 1>And I'm skeptical because I'm working in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the streets saying right,</v>

112
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>anybody who won't help me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pretty much know and I was wrong.</v>

113
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>So we met at a vulnerable place where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>both could learn.</v>

114
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.150
<v Speaker 1>And the power of that relationship is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we didn't have to start hiding from</v>

115
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:35.720
<v Speaker 1>real issues to work together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

116
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles Koch says something that was so</v>

117
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:39.610
<v Speaker 1>strong to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

118
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 1>what do we fiercely agree upon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And less work like hell to make it</v>

119
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:45.730
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like that.</v>

120
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Where do we fiercely agree up also there</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really agreed that everyone wants to</v>

121
00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:50.684
<v Speaker 1>be a citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Do we really agreed that that poverty</v>
<v Speaker 1>should not be the destination.</v>

123
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>It could be a transportation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet do we really agree that,</v>

124
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 1>that anyone can transform the transform</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation?</v>

125
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Redemption yet.</v>

126
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.480
<v Speaker 1>So we just started figuring out what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>agree upon and it was easy to have real</v>

127
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Paul then for me,</v>

128
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 1>it was not political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

129
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.880
<v Speaker 1>it was real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when we had real disagreements,</v>

130
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.500
<v Speaker 1>they were coming from a pure place.</v>

131
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm agree with his policy.</v>

132
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:16.311
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

133
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>well my scoop it and we didn't have any</v>
<v Speaker 1>heartburn.</v>

134
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 1>We had true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

135
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 1>ideas that could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could play out in the theater ideas</v>

136
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 1>and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

137
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.900
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the goal was bigger than the roles</v>

138
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>it was not us trying to figure this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing out.</v>

139
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 1>So it stopped being this conversational</v>
<v Speaker 1>priests.</v>

140
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.150
<v Speaker 1>We figuring out how we played a game</v>
<v Speaker 1>with each other.</v>

141
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.340
<v Speaker 1>It started really being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we do,</v>

142
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.370
<v Speaker 1>do we add value to each other in all we</v>
<v Speaker 1>solving things that other people run a</v>

143
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.420
<v Speaker 1>way from and this in this environment of</v>
<v Speaker 1>us versus them,</v>

144
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Versus left red vs blue,</v>

145
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.320
<v Speaker 1>a blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

146
00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:58.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things create the most,</v>

147
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>echo chamber life that you can have.</v>

148
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 1>And it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have major consequences</v>

149
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.940
<v Speaker 1>when you really have to solve deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

150
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.410
<v Speaker 1>You cannot solve problems that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

151
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.930
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>
