1
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think with the onslaught of celebrity</v>

2
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.610
<v Speaker 1>and our fascination with celebrity at</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a high pitched level that fashion,</v>

3
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of its younger sister or</v>
<v Speaker 1>second cousin,</v>

4
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea of celebrity designers are</v>

5
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>very glamorous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They dress store let's the red carpet,</v>

6
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the handbag business has gone crazy.</v>

7
00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:36.171
<v Speaker 1>So the general population has really</v>
<v Speaker 1>understood fashion way that it never has</v>

8
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>in generations before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's reached,</v>

9
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I think a kind of celebrity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>semi celebrity level where the</v>

10
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>designers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the models,</v>

11
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even,</v>

12
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anna Winter and the devil wears Prada</v>

13
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.570
<v Speaker 1>have become large celebrities in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own rights that has elevated the fashion</v>

14
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:56.510
<v Speaker 1>show to a semi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Papa Razzi event where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>people can be photographed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Famous people go to the shows,</v>

17
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.940
<v Speaker 1>famous models are seen in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>collections and designers that are world</v>

18
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>renowned and famous are seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going in and out of,</v>

19
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.190
<v Speaker 1>out of these shows and these tests.</v>

20
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>The seeding is I'm slightly medieval</v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

21
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>

22
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:19.770
<v Speaker 1>everybody likes to get the best seat</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can.</v>

23
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of editors are very unhappy if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in the second row or the third</v>

24
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically considered Siberia.</v>

25
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:32.301
<v Speaker 1>if you are an editor of good standing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you usually have a front row seat at the</v>

27
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 1>major collection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the major shows in New York for</v>

28
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

29
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 1>the ORC leads that often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must say.</v>

30
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably an appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 1>place for it to be.</v>

31
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York is a solid place for fashion.</v>

32
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a consistently good place for</v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion.</v>

33
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.010
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the innovator,</v>

34
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:55.011
<v Speaker 1>it's not the real creative juice that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>all seek and that the retailers seek to</v>

35
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>really get ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes us excited about the stories we're</v>

36
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>going to put your magazines and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes that are going to be bought and</v>

37
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:03.540
<v Speaker 1>purchased in and ultimately bought in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stores.</v>

38
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm particularly this season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was one of New York's</v>

39
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:10.590
<v Speaker 1>best seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a very beige season.</v>

40
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>And with that comes a certain sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>banality.</v>

41
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that glamorous and</v>

42
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>dramatic about the color of beige.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 1>so I think that's kind of a metaphor for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit with the seasons.</v>

44
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do have a store and he's a major</v>

45
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:25.150
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He continues to shock and rock and,</v>

46
00:02:25.151 --> 00:02:27.960
<v Speaker 1>and push us forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's Marc Jacobs and indeed his,</v>

47
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>both his collections this time we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're very,</v>

48
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His Marc Jacobs collection,</v>

49
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.180
<v Speaker 1>which I just looked at in person and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uptight up close to feel the fabrics and</v>

50
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:37.720
<v Speaker 1>to see the accessories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:42.721
<v Speaker 1>and to really see what he'd done was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>pastiche of ideas and styles and fabrics</v>

52
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>and color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was kind of Laura Engels and</v>

53
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>little house on the prairie on crack.</v>

54
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a crazy apron dress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruffled skirt,</v>

55
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>but done in lyrics and Lemay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

56
00:02:57.421 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>mark pushes the boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pushes the,</v>

57
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.560
<v Speaker 1>he dares to mixed fabrics and colors and</v>
<v Speaker 1>silhouettes and probably because he just</v>

58
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 1>doesn't care that he's free to do what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants and he never repeats himself.</v>

59
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got favorite things that he does.</v>

60
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>There's always a somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a seller all influenced,</v>

61
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:17.450
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but clearly done a mark.</v>

62
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he likes to push people,</v>

63
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>he likes to shake it all up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>he was a famous famous for his grunge</v>
<v Speaker 1>collection in the early nineties and he</v>

65
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>continues to really rock our world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's great and this show was</v>

66
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 1>vibrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>colorful,</v>

67
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>collectic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real mix,</v>

68
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 1>kept everybody on their toes yet again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and is Marc by Marc Jacobs collection,</v>

69
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.600
<v Speaker 1>which is his younger line was just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>delightful and enchanting and if I was,</v>

70
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 to 25 and that was sort of my</v>

71
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 1>demographic and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my age group,</v>

72
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>I would be around running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running,</v>

73
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 1>running to those two stores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into those boutiques to get those</v>

74
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>clothes.</v>

75
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>So he really gets you excited and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you want to buy clothes.</v>

76
00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>He makes you want the handbags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>

77
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Everyone said the it bag is over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody needs groovy bags anymore.</v>

78
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:05.470
<v Speaker 1>That's all passe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget it.</v>

79
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Mark has just made us all realize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is another bag and he had about</v>

80
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:12.530
<v Speaker 1>five that were expect macular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

81
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>in his bark collection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think New York is glad to have</v>

82
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:17.460
<v Speaker 1>mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm certainly personally,</v>

83
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 1>professionally happy to have him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes it exciting,</v>

84
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.540
<v Speaker 1>he's on a level with the best designers</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Europe,</v>

85
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 1>particularly Paris as well as Miuccia</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prada in Milan,</v>

86
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 1>and really keeping fashion exciting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting and pushing it forward.</v>

87
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I admire Anna winter so much because,</v>

88
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of her unbelievable power and,</v>

89
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.670
<v Speaker 1>and because she does a fantastic job at</v>
<v Speaker 1>vogue,</v>

90
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.840
<v Speaker 1>but particularly in this question</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she really tries to promote and</v>

91
00:04:47.841 --> 00:04:52.460
<v Speaker 1>spent a large portion of her time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>vogue's time and effort to promote the</v>

92
00:04:52.461 --> 00:04:56.420
<v Speaker 1>next generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just really hard business to be</v>

93
00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:57.530
<v Speaker 1>that competitive in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:04:57.531 --> 00:05:01.850
<v Speaker 1>these guys are coming up with four to</v>
<v Speaker 1>six collections a year.</v>

95
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.630
<v Speaker 1>That creative process is unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging.</v>

96
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about an artist that has to come</v>

97
00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:10.100
<v Speaker 1>up with a whole of four to six times a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

98
00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:10.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't,</v>

99
00:05:10.941 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

100
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.680
<v Speaker 1>they do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They moved,</v>

101
00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:17.780
<v Speaker 1>they evolve over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over a decade,</v>

102
00:05:17.781 --> 00:05:20.810
<v Speaker 1>over five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys are asked to kind of reinvent</v>

103
00:05:20.811 --> 00:05:25.010
<v Speaker 1>the wheel as well as learning their</v>
<v Speaker 1>trade and trying to have viable</v>

104
00:05:25.011 --> 00:05:25.520
<v Speaker 1>businesses.</v>

105
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.920
<v Speaker 1>So it's really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

106
00:05:27.921 --> 00:05:32.360
<v Speaker 1>for the young generation to come forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>to push forward some of the kinds of new</v>

107
00:05:32.361 --> 00:05:34.400
<v Speaker 1>up and comers that have been around</v>
<v Speaker 1>several seasons.</v>

108
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm disappointed to say that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>faltered a little bit.</v>

109
00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:41.810
<v Speaker 1>They're not able to keep going with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of expectation that we all put on</v>

110
00:05:41.811 --> 00:05:43.220
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

111
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.760
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Anna and the vogue fun and the CFTA,</v>

112
00:05:46.761 --> 00:05:49.730
<v Speaker 1>the council of fashion designers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>America really are trying to support</v>

113
00:05:49.731 --> 00:05:54.731
<v Speaker 1>fashion at that starting level to really</v>
<v Speaker 1>give these young designers the support</v>

114
00:05:54.861 --> 00:05:59.861
<v Speaker 1>and the financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>cash that they need to continue and also</v>

115
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 1>to sort of offer kind of mentoring</v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

116
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:03.254
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

117
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as New York is concerned,</v>

118
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's not been a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>season of newness,</v>

119
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:10.560
<v Speaker 1>but London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

120
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.750
<v Speaker 1>which is happening as we speak right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>is and continues to be a real</v>

121
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.610
<v Speaker 1>interesting place where all those free</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and kind of crazy eccentric things</v>

122
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 1>that the English are known for are able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come out and have created</v>

123
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

124
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think London is really the place where</v>

125
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 1>you watch it the next best generation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>designers.</v>
