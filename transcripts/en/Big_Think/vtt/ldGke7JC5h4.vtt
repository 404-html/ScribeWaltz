1
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.850
<v Speaker 2>well I think first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we didn't have electronic</v>

3
00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:20.810
<v Speaker 2>applications that you wouldn't see quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>that same kind of growth.</v>

4
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.960
<v Speaker 2>I think a second of all is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.380
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see that as a good sign because those,</v>

6
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.540
<v Speaker 2>those institutions are a recognized as</v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

7
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:35.870
<v Speaker 2>Institutions have great excellence</v>
<v Speaker 2>worldwide excellence.</v>

8
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.080
<v Speaker 2>So if more and more students think of</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves as world class scholars,</v>

9
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great that there's that many kids</v>

10
00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:46.760
<v Speaker 2>that want to go out to the very best</v>
<v Speaker 2>schools.</v>

11
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

12
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.140
<v Speaker 2>when I talked to parents and students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I emphasize is there's so many</v>

13
00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:59.591
<v Speaker 2>great schools in America and is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>minister told me once when I was quite</v>

14
00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:05.171
<v Speaker 2>young and he was talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that came to him for advice.</v>

15
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.900
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told him there is not a college or</v>

16
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:13.901
<v Speaker 2>university you go to that you can learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>all they have to teach you.</v>

17
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.950
<v Speaker 2>So I believe that we have a great number</v>
<v Speaker 2>of great institutions in this country</v>

18
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:23.210
<v Speaker 2>and your future doesn't depend upon</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to the very best that people can</v>

19
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:25.250
<v Speaker 2>get a great education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

20
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at people that are</v>

21
00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:30.890
<v Speaker 2>successful in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not all of them have gone.</v>

22
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Certainly many of them haven't gone to</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we would consider the most elite</v>

23
00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:35.510
<v Speaker 2>schools in the school.</v>
