00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.500
<v Speaker 1>The most inspiring thing</v>

2
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.520
<v Speaker 2>you see people stepping forward who</v>
<v Speaker 2>really don't have the capacity,</v>

3
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the time,</v>

4
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 2>they're barely keeping their lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>together and but they still,</v>

5
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 2>they still make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still say,</v>

6
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so important.</v>

7
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:35.541
<v Speaker 2>I have to make the time to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to engage in the political issue,</v>

8
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the war on Iraq or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

9
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a very impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there,</v>

10
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>there are so many people do step up.</v>
