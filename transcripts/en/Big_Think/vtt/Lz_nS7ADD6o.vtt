1
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Very common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

2
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm a professor of psychology at Rutgers</v>
<v Speaker 1>University in Newark,</v>

3
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.630
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:21.631
<v Speaker 1>it was an interesting research study by</v>
<v Speaker 1>events and Wagner that was done in 1975.</v>

5
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:25.180
<v Speaker 1>It was a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a very interesting study</v>

6
00:00:25.181 --> 00:00:28.240
<v Speaker 1>where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they asked men and women to describe</v>

7
00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:29.900
<v Speaker 1>their orgasms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:31.690
<v Speaker 1>in writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they,</v>

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>they remove all the specific references</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the genitals.</v>

10
00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>So you couldn't tell whether it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.820
<v Speaker 1>a man or a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These were college students,</v>

12
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>describing their orgasms.</v>

13
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.960
<v Speaker 1>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

14
00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave the,</v>

15
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.130
<v Speaker 1>the descriptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each one was about a short paragraph of</v>

16
00:00:51.131 --> 00:00:53.410
<v Speaker 1>the description of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the orgasm they gave.</v>

17
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.170
<v Speaker 1>They gave the descriptions too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex therapists and,</v>

19
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>various experts in sexuality and mds</v>

21
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:04.121
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

22
00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:05.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.510
<v Speaker 1>asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you tell which one is written by a,</v>

24
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a male on which is written by a female?</v>

25
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.370
<v Speaker 1>And the upshot of the experiment was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they couldn't tell the difference.</v>

26
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:22.660
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't identify accurately</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether the description of the orgasm</v>

27
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>was made by a man or a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

28
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.120
<v Speaker 1>so on that basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my conclusion and their conclusion is</v>

29
00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:31.840
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.260
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feelings of orgasm when you remove</v>

31
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:40.261
<v Speaker 1>the specific reference to the genitals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would difference between the</v>

32
00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:42.430
<v Speaker 1>genitals and the sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.870
<v Speaker 1>that the feelings of the organism are</v>
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from each other for</v>

34
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.770
<v Speaker 1>between men and women.</v>

35
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't really know why some women</v>

36
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.770
<v Speaker 1>can't experience orgasms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.060
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:59.061 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>I started out by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some years ago,</v>

41
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to find women who don't</v>

42
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:08.320
<v Speaker 1>experience Orgasms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.160
<v Speaker 1>to study them in looking at their brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity during genital self</v>

44
00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:16.490
<v Speaker 1>stimulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we identified one woman and she,</v>

45
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:19.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just before she came to our lab,</v>

46
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:23.330
<v Speaker 1>she said she got a new boyfriend and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's had her orgasm first orgasm.</v>

47
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.800
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that did it for that experiment.</v>

49
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:27.320
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.020
<v Speaker 1>we're still looking and it is a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting question.</v>

51
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:31.010
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't really know.</v>

52
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:32.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly there are,</v>

53
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>there are situations in which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

54
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.660
<v Speaker 1>with a peripheral nerve damage or</v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes,</v>

55
00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:42.400
<v Speaker 1>these can impede the neural transmission</v>
<v Speaker 1>descent,</v>

56
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

57
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.500
<v Speaker 1>the sensory nerves as much more rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the,</v>

58
00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 1>in the case of men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

59
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Kinsey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>reported that only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few,</v>

62
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:53.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or three of the men that they</v>

63
00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:56.560
<v Speaker 1>interviewed out of many hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>could have orgasms by thought.</v>

65
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:05.581
<v Speaker 1>we have found a substantial number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>women who can have orgasms just by</v>

67
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:07.200
<v Speaker 1>thinking and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>we've studied them and we're continuing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to study them.</v>

69
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>It's really very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

70
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.461
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

71
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

72
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>we measured their heart rate and blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure and pain thresholds,</v>

73
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Speaker 1>which is a pain thresholds go up during</v>
<v Speaker 1>orgasm.</v>

74
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

75
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.570
<v Speaker 1>we found that women become much less</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive to pain during orgasm and also</v>

76
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 1>the pupils dilate and all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>measures,</v>

77
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Speaker 1>the heart rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood pressure,</v>

78
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>pain thresholds and pupil dilation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all about doubled during orgasm,</v>

79
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.880
<v Speaker 1>generated by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genital self stimulation.</v>

81
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>What we've found is that women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had 10 women in the laboratory who</v>

82
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>said that they could have orgasms just</v>
<v Speaker 1>by thought.</v>

83
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.620
<v Speaker 1>And we measured their physiological</v>
<v Speaker 1>responses when they applied a genital</v>

84
00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 1>self stimulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual physical stimulation.</v>

85
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>And then we compared it with when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>said that they had orgasms by thought</v>

86
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:06.160
<v Speaker 1>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the physiological responses were</v>

87
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 1>essentially the same.</v>

88
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were indistinguishable.</v>

89
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.520
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

90
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>those women were really having orgasms</v>
<v Speaker 1>just by thinking.</v>

91
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.863
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

92
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had different ideas.</v>

93
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>We asked them what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they,</v>

94
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what their thought process is to elicit</v>

95
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 1>the orgasm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some said that they had erotic</v>

96
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.920
<v Speaker 1>imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but others said that they had,</v>

97
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:29.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

98
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.070
<v Speaker 1>pastor al imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like walking along the shore on a,</v>

99
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:35.150
<v Speaker 1>on a warm summer day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

100
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 1>other women had a much more abstract</v>
<v Speaker 1>image such as,</v>

101
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:40.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

102
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 1>imagining the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

103
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.690
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.660
<v Speaker 1>moving up and down their bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shocker is moving up and down the</v>

105
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.160
<v Speaker 1>bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

106
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.320
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and producing the orgasm.</v>

107
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

108
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>they're a big individual differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now we're looking at their brain</v>

109
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 1>activity in a women who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

110
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 1>have orgasms by thought alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're seeing very,</v>

111
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:07.741
<v Speaker 1>a great similarities between when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have orgasms by just thinking and</v>

112
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 1>orgasms when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

113
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:11.523
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

114
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 1>genital self stimulation.</v>

115
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 1>We're starting to study men and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

116
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a very good question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't really know what,</v>

117
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the differences,</v>

118
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.600
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be much more rare in men</v>
<v Speaker 1>than in women.</v>

119
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

120
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.910
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

121
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd be,</v>

122
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.630
<v Speaker 1>we'll be looking for is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we're finding a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>very new findings is that when,</v>

124
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when women think of different parts of</v>

125
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:47.250
<v Speaker 1>their body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

126
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.370
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

127
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about those parts of the body</v>

128
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.640
<v Speaker 1>activates the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sensory cortex.</v>

129
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.691
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

130
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a map of the body on the sensory</v>
<v Speaker 1>cortex.</v>

131
00:05:58.731 --> 00:05:59.990
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the,</v>

132
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 1>the fingers are in one place and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>toes are represented in another place.</v>

133
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>The face is represented in another</v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

134
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.700
<v Speaker 1>the genitals in another place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

135
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 1>and it's all systematically laid out</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much like the body.</v>

136
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 1>The body plan is laid out on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the sensory cortex.</v>

137
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.650
<v Speaker 1>And what we're finding is that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>women think about their finger being</v>

138
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 1>stimulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they think,</v>

139
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 1>think about their toe being stimulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they think about their,</v>

140
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.893
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

141
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clutter is being stimulated or the</v>

142
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 1>nipple that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

143
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the corresponding part of the body,</v>

144
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:34.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

145
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the representation of,</v>

146
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 1>in the sensory cortex of those body</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts is actually activated just as if</v>

147
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 1>they're really being stimulated</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically.</v>

148
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think one of the interesting</v>

149
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 1>questions is whether since women can</v>
<v Speaker 1>think their genital,</v>

150
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems into actual physical,</v>

151
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.400
<v Speaker 1>into actual activity in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can men do the same thing?</v>

152
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.240
<v Speaker 1>If they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that might be a way of</v>

153
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 1>understanding why women can have orgasms</v>
<v Speaker 1>by thought alone.</v>

154
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Are they activating their genital sis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their genital sensory representation,</v>

155
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.960
<v Speaker 1>which then spreads to other parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain and can mend,</v>

156
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:19.940
<v Speaker 1>not do that or we don't really know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have the tools to investigate</v>

157
00:07:19.941 --> 00:07:20.774
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

158
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.210
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting that you asked that question</v>

159
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:28.460
<v Speaker 1>because we're really dealing with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

160
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we have a,</v>

161
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.543
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

162
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.330
<v Speaker 1>we want to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since we know that if you think about</v>

163
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.180
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about the clearest.</v>

164
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 1>So think about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

165
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 1>the g spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll think about the cervix that those,</v>

166
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.260
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the corresponding part of the bottom of</v>

167
00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:47.930
<v Speaker 1>the brain map for those parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

168
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.240
<v Speaker 1>those become activated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

169
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:55.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one question is whether a women who can</v>

170
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 1>think themselves to orgasm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they think their genital activation,</v>

171
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.680
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a representation of the Genitalia into</v>

172
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:05.120
<v Speaker 1>act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into activity,</v>

173
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 1>and does that spread to the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that are involved in orgasm?</v>

174
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 1>How do they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to understand how they do it</v>

175
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:15.350
<v Speaker 1>normally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is,</v>

176
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:16.910
<v Speaker 1>what if we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

177
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:22.180
<v Speaker 1>ask women to think about the Janet the</v>
<v Speaker 1>genitals,</v>

178
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more intensively or will we,</v>

179
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.670
<v Speaker 1>will we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will they be able to intensify the</v>

180
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.040
<v Speaker 1>response in their genital sensory</v>
<v Speaker 1>cortex?</v>

181
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.140
<v Speaker 1>And will that spread to other parts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain?</v>

182
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Will that facilitate their orgasm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be,</v>

183
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it could be very useful in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in women who say that they don't</v>

184
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:44.960
<v Speaker 1>experience orgasms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be a useful in women with</v>

185
00:08:44.961 --> 00:08:49.880
<v Speaker 1>spinal cord injury who can't feel their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their external genitals.</v>

186
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Can they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can they think their a brain greater</v>

187
00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:59.190
<v Speaker 1>activation and will that facilitate</v>
<v Speaker 1>their orgasm?</v>

188
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

189
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a question that we are currently</v>

190
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.010
<v Speaker 1>dealing with it without a brain research</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a,</v>

191
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:11.930
<v Speaker 1>it's a very important and interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>question and it could be therapeutic for</v>

192
00:09:11.931 --> 00:09:15.030
<v Speaker 1>therapeutically useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the techniques that we're,</v>

193
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.440
<v Speaker 1>that we've developed is to have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>women in the scanner,</v>

194
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at their own brain activity in</v>

195
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 1>near real time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

196
00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:29.400
<v Speaker 1>and the question is if we can see our</v>
<v Speaker 1>own brain activity in near real time in</v>

197
00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:34.401
<v Speaker 1>specific regions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we voluntarily increase the activity</v>

198
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.880
<v Speaker 1>of that part of the brain?</v>

199
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Just by thinking about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

200
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 1>just as um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we can think about moving our finger</v>

201
00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:43.440
<v Speaker 1>and we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can move our finger.</v>

202
00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:46.260
<v Speaker 1>We can wiggle a finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what we do.</v>

203
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.671
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

204
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:51.690
<v Speaker 1>we learned to do it as an infant cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got the feedback between what we see</v>

205
00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:52.950
<v Speaker 1>and what we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do.</v>

206
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we can do the same thing with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

207
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.000
<v Speaker 1>If we see our own brain activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

208
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:03.260
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can make a change and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to change the way we feel</v>

209
00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:06.110
<v Speaker 1>or the way we move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

210
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.650
<v Speaker 1>so this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

211
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.660
<v Speaker 1>a new technology of near real time brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>imaging and,</v>

212
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

213
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:14.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlimited,</v>

214
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:15.691
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frontiers.</v>

215
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:17.850
<v Speaker 1>We don't really know how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

216
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.980
<v Speaker 1>how far we can go with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

217
00:10:19.981 --> 00:10:21.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a new approach.</v>
