1
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.870
<v Speaker 1>My parents come from Bangladesh and both</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them are Muslims and we were raised</v>

2
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.990
<v Speaker 1>somewhat informally in that tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>for a variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

4
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.130
<v Speaker 1>I say informal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we weren't observant in the sense</v>

5
00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:27.800
<v Speaker 1>of going to some kind of religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>service on a very regular basis,</v>

6
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.560
<v Speaker 1>although certainly identified with in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Broadway.</v>

7
00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:35.561
<v Speaker 1>And I remember praying pretty regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are Ssris and you're supposed to</v>

8
00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:39.620
<v Speaker 1>memorize them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember I was taking Arabic</v>

9
00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:43.190
<v Speaker 1>lessons very briefly for maybe only a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks and that I had an</v>

10
00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:44.890
<v Speaker 1>argument with a tutor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.890
<v Speaker 1>about whether androids have souls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>

12
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel as though it was getting</v>

13
00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:53.060
<v Speaker 1>very satisfactory answer regarding the</v>
<v Speaker 1>androids having souls question.</v>

14
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of shirked my duties in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>

15
00:00:57.021 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Speaker 1>I suppose had a kind of broad interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>in religion as a phenomenon and I think</v>

17
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 1>that I identify with Muslim communities</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some broad sense,</v>

18
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:12.230
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not all that reflective about</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion per se.</v>

19
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I kind of recoiled against people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>sneer at religion,</v>

20
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in part because I have a lot of friends</v>

21
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:19.430
<v Speaker 1>who are devoutly religious and relatives</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what have you.</v>

22
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.240
<v Speaker 1>At the same time I think that there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a thing as a religious impulse</v>

23
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:28.241
<v Speaker 1>that's some people possess or don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>possess and I think that I have far more</v>

24
00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:32.210
<v Speaker 1>possessed the spaceman who's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>visiting Earth,</v>

25
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulse rather than the religious</v>

26
00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:35.740
<v Speaker 1>impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

27
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.760
<v Speaker 1>although I also have a kind of booster</v>
<v Speaker 1>richness that I think that some</v>

28
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.920
<v Speaker 1>religious people have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it happens not to apply to religion</v>

29
00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:45.170
<v Speaker 1>per se.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not necessarily a very good</v>

30
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>answer to your question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is my,</v>

31
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.980
<v Speaker 1>those are my kind of broad impressions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of religion.</v>

32
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember once I'm overhearing a</v>

33
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:57.990
<v Speaker 1>conversation in which a guy was asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you from?</v>

34
00:01:57.991 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Orleans.</v>

35
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.460
<v Speaker 1>And then the interlocutors proceeded</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>

36
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was that like?</v>

37
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>And he said something to the effect of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

38
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:07.770
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like all of these people saying</v>

39
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>y'all all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had this contempt for it and that</v>

40
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>really turned my stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just recoiled against it and I thought</v>

41
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have objections to where you're</v>

42
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you share them with your friends who are</v>

43
00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 1>also from New Orleans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't share them with outsiders and</v>

44
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>you certainly don't express that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>contempt.</v>

45
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 1>It just seemed really untoward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then some years later,</v>

46
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>as you may recall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and</v>

47
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:32.090
<v Speaker 1>the same guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

48
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he proceeded to write a kind of moving,</v>

49
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces about the devastation of his</v>

50
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:38.610
<v Speaker 1>native city.</v>

51
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>And I thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person that's beneath contempt.</v>

52
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:41.461
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:42.061
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>at a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very basic gut level thing that,</v>

55
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just not a morally praiseworthy</v>

56
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I guess I think that,</v>

57
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're engaged with something,</v>

58
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should work to improve it to the</v>

59
00:02:55.411 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>extent possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be constructive.</v>

60
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Don't allow your booster parishionist to</v>
<v Speaker 1>blind you to the kind of various foibles</v>

61
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>and downsides of whatever it is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were associated with,</v>

62
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>but do your best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Act in good faith.</v>

63
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>And you consider yourself kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>steward of this tradition that you're a</v>

64
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether voluntarily or involuntarily,</v>

65
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.670
<v Speaker 1>and in a way that's a little unfair</v>
<v Speaker 1>because shelby steele talks about the</v>

66
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism of black identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that no one is obligated to</v>

67
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>identify with a certain thing and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a way in which I can see how that's</v>

68
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:30.060
<v Speaker 1>problematic and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe if we could all be Rafe,</v>

69
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>like beings who are free of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>associations,</v>

70
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:35.140
<v Speaker 1>that would be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't strike me as the world</v>

71
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're embedded in the context and being</v>

72
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>respectful of that strikes me as</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable.</v>
