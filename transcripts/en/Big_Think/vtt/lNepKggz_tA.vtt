1
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.630
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy being a woman in science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different fields,</v>

2
00:00:05.631 --> 00:00:08.090
<v Speaker 1>what my field is one where I'm often</v>
<v Speaker 1>working with mostly men,</v>

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.920
<v Speaker 1>but there are more and more women coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>into science and I think that there's a</v>

5
00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:17.921
<v Speaker 1>lot of issues around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually involve them in the</v>

6
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.360
<v Speaker 1>National Academy of Sciences Committee</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Women in science and engineering and</v>

7
00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:23.750
<v Speaker 1>medicine and we spent a lot of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about what were the issues.</v>

8
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that there's very important</v>

9
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>transition points that we need to focus</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

10
00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:31.880
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of women will do sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates,</v>

11
00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 1>but then fall out going to graduate</v>
<v Speaker 1>school and then there's a bigger follow</v>

12
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.460
<v Speaker 1>that happens to postdoc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why is it,</v>

13
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.260
<v Speaker 1>is there this attrition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

14
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really focusing on nurturing women</v>

15
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:45.530
<v Speaker 1>through their transitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's a lot of cultural and</v>

16
00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:48.590
<v Speaker 1>biological differences with women and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it difficult because science is a</v>

17
00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:53.000
<v Speaker 1>very challenging job and you do have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sacrifices and think about how can</v>

18
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.630
<v Speaker 1>you do it in a way that will work for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

19
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.851
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

21
00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've enjoyed it and I think that in</v>

22
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:02.330
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 1>people try really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just cultural differences that</v>

24
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:09.020
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>things I have to reckon with personally</v>

25
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.710
<v Speaker 1>of how to do my science and be assertive</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still be,</v>

26
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind and assertive and all sorts of</v>

27
00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:17.990
<v Speaker 1>things and how to balance work and life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>

28
00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:18.824
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.710
<v Speaker 1>it's challenging and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot that can be done.</v>

30
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:23.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we definitely can.</v>

31
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.300
<v Speaker 1>I talk about in America that I feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't speak for the rest of the world.</v>

32
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I feel like in America there's lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for women in science.</v>

33
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not about the opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about motivating women to enter</v>

34
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:39.230
<v Speaker 1>science and a lot of the k through 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>education of getting them engaged</v>

35
00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:42.440
<v Speaker 1>earlier on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then also supporting them,</v>

36
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting them through the transitions</v>

37
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.740
<v Speaker 1>because no matter what we say there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fundamental differences with trying</v>

38
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:49.551
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:51.650
<v Speaker 1>with the things that you have to contend</v>
<v Speaker 1>with being a woman.</v>

40
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the opportunity is there,</v>

41
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:55.760
<v Speaker 1>it's just the support systems need to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

42
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

43
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of people say,</v>

44
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.820
<v Speaker 1>and there's a couple of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people say,</v>

45
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.733
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like asked me how it is that I do,</v>

47
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an md and a phd and do research</v>

48
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:14.030
<v Speaker 1>and also have an outside life and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

49
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.070
<v Speaker 1>no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 24 hours in a day.</v>

50
00:02:16.071 --> 00:02:17.840
<v Speaker 1>So I don't like to pretend like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

51
00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:20.120
<v Speaker 1>it's just so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you make sacrifices and,</v>

52
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.380
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't being that healthy for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've regrouped and been like,</v>

54
00:02:24.381 --> 00:02:25.700
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I have to focus and you have to</v>

55
00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:27.950
<v Speaker 1>focus on the longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So going to the gym,</v>

56
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:31.250
<v Speaker 1>doing the yoga and all sorts of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to do in order to sustain</v>

57
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:33.980
<v Speaker 1>yourself for your students and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

58
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:35.180
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

59
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.890
<v Speaker 1>there are challenges at every stage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

60
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.090
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to do when you really like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do.</v>

61
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.440
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the important thing,</v>

62
00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:44.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the idea of liking it.</v>

63
00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Even when you're failing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's failing in it and when it's hard</v>

64
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.110
<v Speaker 1>and just just liking it in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you get a lot more energy and</v>

65
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.470
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows that you have these sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of flexes of high energy and low energy</v>

66
00:02:54.471 --> 00:02:58.490
<v Speaker 1>and if you can maintain yourself in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>place where you're always very focused</v>

67
00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>and energetic and excited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can do a lot more.</v>

68
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of that comes with finding the</v>

69
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>thing that's your passion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once you find your passion,</v>

70
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>the day to day gets a lot easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I love music and I would just do it</v>

71
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

72
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>so whether I was in a band or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I write music all the time,</v>

73
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 1>so it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not actually challenged in a lot of</v>

74
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 1>times I'm embarrassed to say like write</v>
<v Speaker 1>songs,</v>

75
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>like on my bike ride to work.</v>

76
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the kind of thing that I do</v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally and,</v>

77
00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>and engage in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it gives me time if I was to do</v>

78
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>something that was totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 1>write a book that's out of my field and</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's a bigger sacrifice.</v>

80
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Unless it was something where the ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just being for me and I was just</v>

81
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>really engaged in the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there is definitely challenges at</v>

82
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>every stage of being active and keeping</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and sacrifices I've made.</v>

83
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

84
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't started a family yet.</v>

85
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously the,</v>

86
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.560
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

87
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.481
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if I do,</v>

88
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be another thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring into the mix,</v>

89
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>which is challenging.</v>
