<v Speaker 1>Brian mitchell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's first name is spelled like mine,</v>

2
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.680
<v Speaker 1>m a r I a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's pronounced Mariah and not</v>

3
00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Maria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the first recognized female</v>

4
00:00:14.171 --> 00:00:19.171
<v Speaker 1>astronomer in America and was the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman elected unanimously to the</v>

5
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.860
<v Speaker 1>American Academy of Arts and Sciences in</v>
<v Speaker 1>1831 when she was still a teenager</v>

6
00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:27.580
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with stargazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She heard that the king of Denmark had</v>

7
00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:30.370
<v Speaker 1>offered a gold metal valued at 20 ducats</v>
<v Speaker 1>cats,</v>

8
00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:34.360
<v Speaker 1>which was a lot of money at the time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first person to discover a</v>

9
00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:39.310
<v Speaker 1>telescopic comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took her 16 years to master the</v>

10
00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:44.311
<v Speaker 1>science and the craft of observation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she did become the first person and</v>

11
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.560
<v Speaker 1>see 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>47.</v>

12
00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:52.561
<v Speaker 1>T one was known for a hundred years as</v>
<v Speaker 1>ms dot Mitchell's comments.</v>

13
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Later when she was hired to teach</v>
<v Speaker 1>astronomy at Vassar,</v>

14
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>the newly established Vassar College,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was the first woman on the faculty</v>

15
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.580
<v Speaker 1>and according to the official handbook</v>
<v Speaker 1>of college rules,</v>

16
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 1>female students were not allowed to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside after dark.</v>

17
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>This was a problem for the study of</v>
<v Speaker 1>astronomy.</v>

18
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm Mitchell fought tirelessly to</v>
<v Speaker 1>overturn not just this,</v>

19
00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:19.351
<v Speaker 1>but many other roles based on antiquated</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender norms that held back women in</v>

20
00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:20.800
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later,</v>

21
00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:25.420
<v Speaker 1>she was hired as the first woman to</v>
<v Speaker 1>perform a nondomestic specialized skill</v>

22
00:01:25.421 --> 00:01:29.770
<v Speaker 1>for the US federal government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was paid $300 a year for her job as</v>

23
00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:33.790
<v Speaker 1>a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Venus for the United States Nautical</v>

24
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Almanac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very,</v>

25
00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:40.870
<v Speaker 1>very mathematically rigorous job that</v>
<v Speaker 1>require her to perform very complex</v>

26
00:01:40.871 --> 00:01:45.070
<v Speaker 1>calculations that would predict the</v>
<v Speaker 1>position of Venus in the sky for years</v>

27
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:48.010
<v Speaker 1>to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the days before gps and</v>

28
00:01:48.011 --> 00:01:50.710
<v Speaker 1>satellites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how sailors all over the world</v>

29
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.800
<v Speaker 1>navigated the oceans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time she was 40,</v>

30
00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Mitchell had reached celebrity status as</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most famous women in the</v>

31
00:01:57.221 --> 00:01:59.320
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a remarkable feat for a</v>

32
00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:03.250
<v Speaker 1>scientist even today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have many celebrity scientists,</v>

33
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was most beloved for her</v>

34
00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:09.040
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary generosity of spirit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>went along with her genius.</v>

35
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.700
<v Speaker 1>She didn't much care for the accolades</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the recognition and the celebrity,</v>

36
00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:17.701
<v Speaker 1>but she went out of her way to mentor</v>
<v Speaker 1>and help cultivate the talents of women</v>

37
00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:19.690
<v Speaker 1>in science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.670
<v Speaker 1>which required that she overcame her</v>
<v Speaker 1>painful shyness in order to be a public</v>

39
00:02:24.671 --> 00:02:28.120
<v Speaker 1>speaker and a public figure and a role</v>
<v Speaker 1>model and an educator,</v>

40
00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:31.960
<v Speaker 1>which he continued to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She continue to teach right up until her</v>

41
00:02:31.961 --> 00:02:33.580
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
